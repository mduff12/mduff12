7,The devil isn't sinful,"If you are a Christian (i am) you know that sin separates us from God and sin cannot exist in the presence of God. That's the whole reason Christ died, to take on the burden of sin for us and act as an intermediary between sinful us and holy God. But, we know from the bible that the devil is allowed in the presence of God, and even talks to God without an intermediary (book of job). Therefore, we can conclude based on the bible that the devil is not, in fact, sinful. My own conclusion is that he is evil, and does evil, but he is fulfilling the mandate that God created him for. Angels do not have free will (we see in the bible that angels, demons, and even satan have no choice but to obey the orders of God and Jesus), the devil is/was an angel, therefore he is just doing what God created him to do or commanded him to do.

15,Bruising of the Left Eye,"Hi everyone I just saw a post about how the worlds elite all have their left eye bruised, which presumably means they are in some sort of ‚Äúsecret club‚Äù.
Here‚Äôs a [photo ](https://i.4pcdn.org/x/1470240309775.jpg)as an example.

In my opinion this is done to initiate a member into secrets of our universe and beyond Earth knowledge, while keeping the rest of us in the dark and under control. 

In meditation, the third eye appears as a *reflection* of the left eye, and is violet/ purple colored. The third eye is a gateway to a higher understanding, which once again the 1% knows of this you can see it everywhere especially on the back of the $1 bill. 

Check out my short [blog](https://energywavesymptom.blogspot.com/2021/01/the-inner-eye.html), it demonstrates that there is in fact a God or higher power out there because it shows us that we are designed. 

So to recap, the 1% knows about the existence of a God or higher power, and uses it to keep the rest of us in the ‚Äúcaves‚Äù. 

I just recently read about the Vril parasite, and how it also may be the cause of bruising; however I‚Äôm not too familiar with the theory. 

In my opinion, the reflection of the third eye during meditation is a more likely the case because it also sometimes appears in a prism, and Egyptians are known for their pyramids. I guess both theories match up quite well.

Anyways does anybody have more information about the Vril parasite? And in know for certain there is a God or higher power out there because we are designed. Thanks looking forward to your comments.",conspiracy

Find a small online business to shop from. 3rd. Stop sending kids to public school and get together with local districts and form your own school away from the public education system. That way you can educate your children the way people in your community want, not some federal institution. 4th. Become self reliant and build your local community. Work together to build farms and make products. Lastly. Turn off your phone and the news. You will see how much people really love one another and want to help each other no matter where they come from. The best way to take away from the rich is not to give them a dime.

43,"When did the term ""skeptic"" become synonymous with ""dismissive to anything outside the mainstream narrative""?","Im well aware of when/how the term ""conspiracy theory"" was born.  And I personally take no qualm with the term.  I find nothing upsetting about saying that I believe people will conspire to achieve a goal, and theorizing why or how.  I can entertain an idea without being wholly invested in it, or even entirely believing it.

But when did ""skeptic"" come to mean ""supporter of the mainstream narrative"".  If anything, I believe ""conspiracy theorist"" is more synonymous with skepticism.  

Even in Oxford Dictionary, a skeptic is defined as ""a person inclined to question or doubt accepted opinions"". But I know so many people who claim to be skeptics while actively and closemindedly dismissing anything outside of the mainstream or not in popular media.  The contradiction is even given legitimacy by the term being tied to career-debunkers or narrative supporters like Michael Shermer (Skeptics Magazine and The Skeptics Society) or Brian Dunning (author and host of Skeptoid).

Ive listened to those 2 and many like them several times, and they act more like defense attorneys using fallacies than people sincerely and objectively questioning and investigating.   Their whole game is to just dismiss and appeal to authority (a lot of the time, I wont say always.)

129,New Earth BIG new info,"There is a lot of information about the New Earth I have found and pieced together. (Relates to the New world order)

We changed our calendar system multiple times over millennia resulting in the loss of years. The country Ethiopia STILL uses the ancient Coptic calendar though, for them its 2013, for us its 2021.

This means 2012 was in 2020, the 'Christmas star' happened on 21st December 2020 which is the EXACT same date the Maya said ‚Ä¶

The Hopi who lived among the Mayans prophesised the new era begins when the 'Blue Kachina star' comes. This could be that star

The Maya never stated the end of the calendar would signal the end of the world, but the Hopi who they lived among did prophecies a purification of the planet would happen among the coming of the new world which we just entered

Now if you look at the site in which the Maya stuff relating to the 13th Baktun on the Mesoamerican calendar were found it is literally called ""la corona""

Corona = body part resembling a crown, so crown virus. This corresponds to the crown chakra from spirituality which is essentially a energy centre of universal knowledge and spiritualism. 

This is interesting because most ancient prophecies such as the Tibetan prophecy, Hermetic, Hopi all state the cause of the coming events is due to a collective disconnection from spirit

The universal mind expresses itself through symbolism archetypes and synchronicity, the name correspondences aren't a coincidence. 

The Queen literally mentioned ""The New Dawn"" in one of her recent speeches

There is SOOOOO much more information, relating to aliens, the nature of space, war, metaphysical PROOF of certain things happening on the planet right now. The information is really important. I've made a video compiling the most important information together, here it is:

182,Mass Gofundme Operation: Gov't Cuomo Edition: Taking back the power; Throwing shit at the wall.,"This thought just popped into my head replying to another post regarding Gov't Cuomo's lawsuit debacle. 

This isn't to bash Cuomo but to exploit the unchallenged loop holes these government figures take advantage of. 

When it comes to Cuomo he was faced with two options which lead to these cases being a perfect example. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current Situation:

&amp;#x200B;

Lawsuit 1:Negligence

\- Thousands of angry family members filing lawsuits on behalf of their deceased loved ones.

\- Historical lawsuit amounts to be  to the families. re-evaluation of policies. 

\- Thousands of convictions. 

\- Failed at protecting the people he was elected to protect.

\- Career ending.

&amp;#x200B;

Lawsuit 2:Negligence

\- One individual for excessive touching.

\- One lawsuit to be payable to one.

\- One conviction.

\- Opportunity to remain Gov't.

\- Leaves next agenda opportunity open with time availability.

&amp;#x200B;

Where does the money come from for lawsuits in Govt?

\- YOUR money (Taxpayers).

&amp;#x200B;

TIME FOR GOFUNDME:

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've witnessed Gofundme work in many ways:

\- Individuals donate their own money to support someone's cause.

\- Recipients after goal is raised withdrawls funds and pays a percentage to Gofundme for using their platform.

\- Countless cases on Godfundme raising $500,000 or more. 

\- Most individuals reach a realistic goal and ""go on with their life.""-(Our mission)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE POST\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\- I've noticed over time that if people accept the Gofundme payout it appears their lawsuits go away.

\- Like choosing one pay out(Gofundme) or the other (Court System).

\- I have no knowledge of how that works but Gofundme having a clause in place to restrict double dipping just seems common sense.

&amp;#x200B;

THE Plan:

\- We can attempt to take control back or even aggressively shake up the current situation.

\- Just like with GameStop they used the market against themselves.

\- Raise money for this girl on Gofundme.

\- She will then be forced with choosing the money or continuing lawsuit on Cuomo.

\- This plan in itself will reveal the agenda.

\- This plan itself will mix things up in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

\- This female has been implemented in an agenda to overshadow the lawsuits filed on behalf of the deceased nursing home family members.

\- Girl wants justice from Cuomo for negligence.

\- Give her a couple hundred thousand for her troubles.

\- She refuses gofundme payout, she in with the agenda.

\- She takes payout which makes her go away.

\- MSM will then need to scramble to find another replacement story to over-shadow the Nursing home debacle.

\- All and all your tax paying money is spent on these MSM stories regarding govt officials.

\- Take back control of your money and how its spent.",conspiracy

I asked them who was it with and what was said so it can trigger my memory and they were like ya were not allowed to tell you. Because of ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù. But you listed me as a witness. If I have more details I could fill in the blanks. I don‚Äôt doubt that I was a witness but because of my nature I don‚Äôt find shit offensive. I have very thick skin.

I‚Äôm willing to bet he said something I laughed at then walked away. My bosses were like so has Alex ever said anything sexual to you? I‚Äôm like ya. We‚Äôre guys. And I should add I live in NY.

Literally everything is offensive to people these days. 

&gt; A second former aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is accusing him of sexual harassment, saying that he asked her questions about her sex life, whether she was monogamous in her relationships and if she had ever had sex with older men. Mr. Cuomo never tried to touch her, Ms. Bennett said, but the message of the entire episode was unmistakable to her.

No touch = No sexual harassment. Touch = Sexual Harassment. If anything it‚Äôs her fault for not telling him to back off. 

I‚Äôm no Cuomo Supporter. What I am is a Straight white man whose consistent. I defended Kavanaugh and Trump because it‚Äôs all Political. With Trump everyone knew he was a playboy. Dude bragged about his exploits for years. And he did it when he was a private citizen. Notice how no Female White House Staffers made Sexual Harassment /Assault claims while he was President? 

Yet with Kavanaugh it got vicious. They tried to destroy his Life with a Woman who he never met. Ford couldn‚Äôt even remember the 5 w‚Äôs. Who, what, when, where, and why. And yet this was Democrats best (fake) ‚Äúwitness‚Äù chance to stop him. 

Meanwhile with Democrats you had Clinton with the Blue Cum Stained dress, and Biden sexually touching minors on Camera. Democrats allow the real predators to skate free yet focus on these nothing burgers with Cuomo asking questions about a woman personal life to gain info to see if she‚Äôs interested. Why am I confident about this? Because I as a straight white man use the same tactics. Why is it wrong to gain information to see what people and what type of man they like? 

If asking questions is Sexual Harassment then all straight men is guilty of Sexual Harassment. It pains me to defend Cuomo. Because these claims are such a obvious attempt to distract from him murdering old people. And yet straight men from the Elite down to us Peasants are getting in trouble for dumb shit that‚Äôs a waste of peoples time.",conspiracy

Summary 
Adrenochrome-- it's a real substance, and one sold openly online to labs with the proper paperwork. It's also mentioned in numerous works of literature, from Huxley's ""The Doors of Perception"" to Hunter S. Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and more.

Where did they get this material? They're talking about it like they found it, and were examining it. They call the material Ce3Bi4Pd3.

""an exotic metal made of cerium, bismuth, and palladium was examined and a giant Hall effect was found to be produced by the material, in the total absence of any magnetic field.""

That they would even think to run this particular test seems suspicious. Like they knew there was something special about the material.

It's also interesting that institutions from so many different countries were involved with testing the material.

I can't find anything about any man-made alloys having been made with these metals.

239,Rich people want virus to spread?,"Whole covid thing doesn't sit right. Feels like 9/11 did: facts don't add up.

Rich people/ruling class want covid to spread?
-Is a lab made virus: either it escaped or was created &amp; planted to look like it escaped. You don't weld people into their apartments as they did in China unless it's the real deal or you're trolling the west.
-Decrease population = more time to reach sustainability
-always having new strains = perpetual control of people
-allows us to test &amp; bring out new medical tech (mRNA vaccines)
-govts aren't really trying to stop it (no rapid-tests, no paying people to stay home if they have covid, mask theater, hygiene theater, minimal extra $ sent to firms researching actual solutions, I bet we gave more to airlines than we did to biomedical startups in 2020.)
-U.S. intel controls big tech and the media.
-virus allows big tech to clamp down on free-speech, brand domestic skeptics as terrorists, complete narrative control. (Note ISIS is back now that Biden is back?)
-more monitoring of citizens, need a vaccine passport to get takeout food. lol.
-adversity of the virus divides people: look at China vs. US rhetoric or just mask vs no mask. Divided people are easy to control, so are people that are stuck at home.
-Moves towards acceptance of trans-humanism: wouldn't you accept altered DNA if the other option was forever-lockdown?
-breaks an already struggling education system. (who knows what will replace it, probably stronger indoctrination? Maybe better education? hah.)
-end of retail work / many service jobs now that we're talking about 'endemic' covid. U.S. Manufacturing is constrained by having smart people who show up; they need bodies.
-deflation from a terrible economy allows for big loans bringing future value to the present and giving policy makers capital to put towards 'innovation.'  Or just their friends? Staves off $ collapse?

My conspiracy theory that I personally have been wondering about and haven't seen mentioned:

-&gt; 10% of people are getting long haul covid. Look it up, no joke. Bad deal. Long covid matches CFS, has been around a while now. Various ailments matching covid have been around for years.

-&gt; US has been experimenting with bio-weapons for a long time, other govts are sure to be also chasing bio weapons. 

-&gt; It's now easier than ever to do this sort of biology in your garage, even small countries can afford a bio lab. 

-&gt; Here's the leap: Weapons labs have been quietly spreading viruses to 'enemy' countries to hamper important companies, take out leaders, etc...

-&gt; If they've been screwing with 'enemies' then weapons labs have been sending viruses to their own county to inoculate their own populations. Getting one virus can give you immunity to another virus, don't require vaccines. People who are asymptomatic covid got a de-powered version of the virus, or just lucked out and had a version that worked ok with their DNA.

-&gt; US FDA haven't approved universal rapid-tests because they want covid to spread. That's why we don't pay people to stay home if they have covid, &amp; why we aren't doing a serious lockdown &amp; why we're all over the map on masks.

-&gt; Everyone will always need the newest booster shot to fight the next 'new strain' which is lab derived &amp; let loose by either our own labs or someone else. (aliens!!!) 

Gradually people get used to perpetual bio war under the guise of a pandemic in order to clear the population so aliens(or rich people?) can take over completely. BIll Gates owns 2.2 million acres of farmland. Neo-Feudalism, coming to a planet near you!",conspiracy

interesting links:  
The EU is set to declare war on encryption  
from WWI conspiracy to incoming Iran war - same bullshitters and spiners, same tricks  
Modern part of the Game‚Äôs history  
As depicted, Goyi Go has been played globaly forever, with same common brainfuck in all  
parts of the world. This time, let‚Äôs look into its intricacies and evolution within EU game world.  
Agenda has been pushing into poor EU members for decades in order to control the area. This was also a reason why those states were allowed entry into EU, even though it was obvious that within EU &amp; Euro they would never catch up. Having monetary autonomy was critical tool for their economies within global society, but that was taken away. In return, they got access to EU development funds, which were actually used for hostile takeover through intentional corruption.  
But even decades before that step, ¬ªformer¬´ USA marines with Nazi inclinations were systematically being send on this area. Some as returning expats, some on various exchange programs and  manufactured jobs etc. They were directed by higher levels ‚Äì staff from embassies, diplomats,  
various NATO exchange and coooperative programs etc. Plenty of civilians  came from Israel.   
Common denominator of all these ¬ªgame tokens¬´ is that they all had a dual role ‚Äì official  and covert  
one.   
Typical tokens with dual roles:

* ambassadors, coordinating traffic, advancement of their tokens under their hierarchical position, acquisiton of new tokens and data and reporting upwards former politicians, soldiers, ambassadors etc that have suddenly developed	a ¬ªlove for the country¬´ and sent themselves on extensive tours, gathering data to sell to the network and prove their value.
* expats, 	returning form USA etc and getting jobs in military, police,¬ªsecurity¬´ companies etc.
* businessmen with shady paths within USA that have suddenly remembered their family roots and decided to share some of their ¬ªwisdom¬´ with their birth place.
* members of non-public societies and movements, like Fremasons etcetc. These tend to be invited either as public fassade or for their already established societal position (bankers, influential politicians etc).

Since Goyi Go is not uniform game by any means, knowledge of the terrain and population was essential. This is where those tokens were used mostly ‚Äì to scan the terrain and social fabric and propagate information for further processing.  
Most of the goals in that phase was network growth and for this, they needed vital information about cooperative elements as well as weak spots for new targets. Trivial example, underpaid, disgruntled psycho cop. Or a judge with a gambling problem. Or a kid with a drug problem, or a drunk doctor that botched some case etc.

What is less visible  
form the top layers of hierarchy is that th  
is rot has used  
gornmental infrastructure and its EVERY asset to spread as deep into  
sicietal infrastructure as possible.",conspiracy
261,"Are there people here who truly, truly fear that going out in public will allow you to get the virus and then die? Like this is an actual emotional state you are in when in public, literally fearing death?","Not sure why it took my so long, but when trying to rationalize why so many people will willing participate in dehumanizing measures, at their own and loved ones expense, it finally hit me that there are people out there that truly believe they could die by going out in the public. 

They can also fear that they themselves can pick something up and literally kill loved ones with their presence. 

It‚Äôs such a terrible way to live, and is an emotional state projected upon you by people who want to make money. 

I know most of you cling to and advertise the success of allopathic medicine within the germ theory paradigm to receive social/societal rewards, but if you truly want to live a life free of irrational fear, break free of the germ theory. 

‚ÄúDisease‚Äù is literally the conflict active or and primarily the healing phase of a tissue adaptation your body underwent. Tissue adapatations can stem from only four things:

Injury
Poison 
Malnutrition
Specific biological special programs

The first three are obvious

The last one should be, but is completely hidden from modern medicine, and is so for good reason. 

Biological special programs are seen in nature on every level of existence. These programs have been developed over the entirety of life, and allow for all organisms to adapt to stimuli instantaneously to increase likelihood of survival. 

What triggers these biological special processes are a specifc, highly acute, completely unexpected, shock which is registered across the psyche, brain and body simultaneously. 

Once the shock has happened, depending on how it was perceived, tissue augmentation will begin immidiatly in the area that is associated with the shock in both the brain and body. 

For example, if a mother bear sees her cub get injured, it will trigger a response in the brain and body that starts the proliferation of breast cells, that will allow for more nutrients and more milk to be released to aid the cub. 

As humans, these biological processes are still present. And due to our understanding of language and symbols, we can transmute non biological issues into biological issues, if the conflict is shocking enough. 

So if you take the above example, if a woman sees her young child get hit by a car, this will illicit the same response. The proliferation of breast tissue to aid the child with increased milk and nutrients. However, this still happens even if the woman is not currently breast feeding. It‚Äôs an inherent evolutionary biological response. 

But modern medicine, will negate this entire process, and when the woman goes to the doctor, may be diagnosed with breast cancer to the growth in breast tissue. 

Then starts the money sucking ‚Äúcure‚Äù process. 

It should also be noted that the shock of the cancer diagnose can also create another one of these shocks leading to ‚Äúmore cancer‚Äù and more treatment. 

Had the women been left alone, and had she resolved the conflict I.e the child recovered, the body would naturally remove the excess tissue via internal fungi and bacteria, and no one would have known any better. 

There is a science that can literally qualify any symptom and pinpoint it directly to a pre programmed response due to a conflict based on the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm) which are the basis of all tissue in the body. 

It‚Äôs called German new medicine and it allows you to live life without fear.",conspiracy

298,I believe the world's most wanted man (Jan Marsalek) may be keeping Belarus in power.,"For those who are unfamiliar: Meet Jan Marsalek. The man who defrauded German tech company Wirecard for billions of dollars as their CFO and fled Germany. Marsalek is closely tied to the Russian GRU as well as a shady web of oligarchs. He travels under fake passports through private chartered planes and fictitious consulate identities. Bellingcat does amazing work at detailing Marsalek and his motives and travel patterns here:

https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/07/18/worlds-most-wanted-man-jan-marsalek-located-in-belarus-data-points-to-russian-intel-links/

According to a report by the ""Handelsbalt"", the fugitive ex-Wirecard board member Jan Marsalek has gone to Russia. The manager, who has been in hiding for weeks, is housed on an estate west of Moscow under the supervision of the Russian military intelligence service GRU, the ""Handelsblatt"" reported, citing Entrepreneur, judicial and diplomatic circles.

Marsalek had previously made significant sums of money in the form of bitcoins from Dubai to Russia.

Wirecard had admitted in June that the annual balance sheet is missing 1.9 billion euros and that the money probably does not even exist. The stock exchange price of the Dax group crashed , the company filed for bankruptcy. In the case, the public prosecutor's office in Munich I.

The investigative platform Bellingcat previously reported that Marsalek had flown from Klagenfurt via the Estonian capital Tallin to Minsk in Belarus on the day he was released.

Because of the political conflict between the Russian leadership and Belarusian head of state Alexander Lukashenko, it was too risky for the GRU to leave Marsalek in the neighboring country. That is why he was taken to Russia.

This is where it gets interesting:

He bought airplane tickets and had someone in the Philippines falsify immigration records to mislead investigators he was in Asia. In various post-disappearance chats with friends and former colleagues, he alluded that he is in an East Asian time-zone, or that he is sipping cocktails on a sunny island. However, it was one answer to an unexpected question that led us to his actual destination ‚Äì and his likely whereabouts today. In a chat with a former colleague, reported by Handelsblatt, he was asked, sympathetically, if he was in a ‚Äúpolitically stable environment‚Äù. Marsalek laughed this question off, saying ‚Äúdo not worry, the same people have been in power for the last 25 years‚Äù.

Very few jurisdictions around the world can boast this degree of stability. (Russia is not one of them, as Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, i.e. 5 years short of his description). And while many rushed to seek his traces in African, Latin America or Asian regimes with longevity, we remembered of a bastion of stability that is much closer to Jan Marsalek‚Äôs home. In Belarus ‚Äì only an hour‚Äôs flight from Germany ‚Äì the same president, Aleksander Lukashenka, has been in power for the last 25 years (in fact, turning 26 years in 2 days).

Given that immigration data for Jan Marsalek from Philippines had been fabricated, it would be a legitimate question if there a risk that the border-crossing data from Belarus and Russia might also be tampered with, to create a further false lead. While this is technically possible, FSB has complete control over the Russian border service, and thus over the centralized Russia-Belarus border database. Therefore, any manipulation of data would have to be done at the behest of, or at least with the consent of, the FSB. If this were to happen, this would indicate a direct collaboration between Jan Marsalek and the FSB ‚Äì which would, ironically, arguably be an even more newsworthy story than locating Marsalek in Belarus.

One of the world's most wanted men is hiding under Belarusian dictator Lukashenko.

When Lukashenko assumed office, he had the following cabinet in 2000:

Chairman of the Council of Ministers
Vladimir Putin
Mikhail Kasyanov
Mikhail Fradkov
Viktor Zubkov
Dmitry Medvedev
Mikhail Mishustin

All known as corrupt Russian mobsters with ties to political and intelligence agencies. Worth billions. Jan Marsalek is without a doubt controlled by GRU, and has a vested interest in being shielded in Belarus, which one can assume Putin allows.

Marsalek pulled a billion dollar heist and gets to coast in a private manor filled with all the hookers money can buy. Putin keeps Lukashenko in power for various political reasons and lines his pockets with a few hundred million.",conspiracy

***

Latest update on liquid insertions to ~~cause havoc &amp; make money~~ ""cure all ills"", comes in the form of yet another ""Emergency Use Authorization"" for an ""unapproved product"" [pp 1]

It's (always) striking when:

&gt; *""In clinical studies,* ***severe allergic reactions,*** *including
anaphylaxis, have been reported following the administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine""*

[pp 3]

is followed up by sidenotes such as:

&gt; *... cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to recipients.*

&gt; *""Serious adverse events are defined as:*

&gt; *‚Ä¢ Death;*

&gt; *‚Ä¢ A life-threatening adverse event;*

&gt; *‚Ä¢ Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;*

&gt; *‚Ä¢ A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions;*

&gt; *‚Ä¢ A congenital anomaly/birth defect;*

&gt; *‚Ä¢ An important medical event that based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the individual and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.*

Question:

First SAR is ""Death"".

Severe: Yes. But listing it as such; did it occur?

Or just Standard Precaution just in case?

I smell carpet rolling over a mishap not to be investigated.

But no deaths due to the actual injection is listed in the document. Worth lending an eye to.

Moving along:

***

[pp 5]

Two points to their ""credit"" - pt 2 on [pp 4]:

1)

&gt; *2. The vaccination provider must communicate to the individual receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine or their caregiver, information consistent with the ‚Äú[Fact Sheet for Recipients](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download?utm%E2%80%94medium=email&amp;utm%E2%80%94source=govdelivery)""*

2) (From the Recipients-paper)

The injection does not contain aluminium-, nor mercury salts - nor mRNA tweaks.

This is a first. But see the very last paragraph on this post before nodding.

***

Which is why there are two fact-sheets; they will *not* give a recipient all the info in here contained.

Which means: injectors will say what they want - have you injected, and move you down the (dis)assembly-belt to prod the next guy.

***-NEXT!***

***

For order's sake:

&gt; *""To the extent feasible, report adverse events to Janssen Biotech, Inc.*

&gt; *e-mail* | *Fax number* | *Telephone numbers* |
---|---|---|
*JNJvaccineAE@its.jnj.com* | *215-293-995* | *US Toll Free: 1-800-565-4008 US Toll: (908) 455-9922""* |

[pp 5]

***

[pp 6]

&gt; *""There is no approved alternative vaccine to prevent COVID-19""*

***

&gt; *""Although limited scientific information is available, based on the totality of the scientific evidence available to date, it is reasonable to believe that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine* ***may*** *be effective for the prevention of COVID-19 ...""*

***

The injection may be so safe, it needs yet another paragraph:

&gt; *""THE COUNTERMEASURES INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM*

&gt; *The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a federal program that has been created to help pay for related costs of medical care and other specific expenses to compensate people injured after use of certain medical ountermeasures.""*

[pp 6]

***

[pp 8]

&gt; *""‚Ä¢ The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine does not contain a preservative.""*

A plus, I guess.

***

But fret not:

[pp 9]

&gt; *""It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults, and hospitalized or fatal cases of COVID-19 following vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.""*

Notice how they wrap the insides out by twisting *""fatal cases of COVID-19 following vaccination""*?

Me neither. How. Fucking. Cute.

***

&gt; *""A total of 43,783 individuals were enrolled in this study, of whom 21,895 adults aged 18 years and older received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine""*

(People of several countries and rainbow-persuations, ages 18-100 : mean; 52 yo.

21,895 test subjects - 21,888 placebo)

[pp 10 &amp; 12]

***

[pp 12] continued

&gt; ***""Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and other events of interest***
""SAEs, excluding those related to confirmed COVID-19, were reported by 0.4% (n=83) of individuals who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (N= 21,895) and 0.4% (n=96) of individuals who received placebo (N= 21,888)*""

I.e; More serious advents in the placebo-group than in the ""Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine"".

What ever else beside saline-water was in the placebo, I ask.

***

[pp 12] continued

&gt; *""Additional adverse events of interest, including but not limited to allergic, neurologic, inflammatory, vascular, and autoimmune disorders, were analyzed among all adverse events ...""*

[pp 13]

&gt; *""An SAE of* ***severe pain*** *in the injected arm, not responsive to analgesics, with immediate onset at time of vaccination, and that was ongoing 74 days following vaccination was reported in an individual who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. An SAE of* ***severe generalized weakness, fever, and headache,*** *with onset on the day following vaccination and resolution three days following vaccination was reported in an individual who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.""*

&gt; *""Both SAEs are likely related to the vaccine.""*

followed by:

* 11 people developed blood-clots

* 4 got seizures

* 6 developed tinnitus

As usual:

&gt; * *""For these events, a causal relationship with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine cannot be determined.""*

In other words, if poor little you have pain afterwards, it's likely the ""vaccine"".

But if you dare develop life-threatening symptoms, such as blood-clots, it's your fault *""confounded by the presence of underlying medical conditions""*.

***

Pregnancy [pp 16]

&gt; *""Available data on Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.""*

They tested human 0.5ml doses on rabbits prior to-, and after mating:

&gt; * ""*No vaccine related adverse effects on female fertility, embryo-fetal or
postnatal development up to Postnatal Day 28 were observed.""*

Rabbits have short pregnancies compared to women, and woman may develop other issues down the line, not yet registered.

Don't fuck with an unborn child. There's no data regarding breast-feeding or lactation either.

***

[pp 20]

182 people got COVID after ""vaccination""...

14 severe/critical.

Mostly between 18-59 yo.

All survived.

5 placebo-recipients reported dead from COVID.

***

And so we're clear:

This is another cocktail: The familiar spike-proteins suspected to be the shell of the original virus, have been added to Adenovius 26.

Aka: [The common Cold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae).

[pp 17]

You see, they have so much actual COVID virus on ice, they had to make a Flu with the usual Spike-Protein to make a vaccine with it.

So... Despite no heavy-metals nor mRNA;

* they effectively just made COVID-21.

And inject it into people, calling it a vaccine.

For a virus. That never mutates.

Ever.

I smell another strain being let lose quite soon.

(And thus: another vaccine in 2022.

And 2023...

And ... just jump off a cliff already)

***

And as per above; (usual) immune-system response include auto-immune-disease, (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) - [pp 1]).

=The body is yet again triggered to attack itself - the inevitable course of action by utilizing the Skeleton Key of our Immune System.

333,We can‚Äôt keep doing this. There‚Äôs a simple solution to fixing American society.,"I think we can all pretty much all agree that there are some serious problems with American society, and that we have been on a steady trajectory of ignoring them and/or making them worse. The fact that we have been moving in the wrong direction for so long comes with a certain momentum that limits the range of possible futures we might encounter. At this point, the bullseye of what we can expect is pointing somewhere in the cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic genre. With utopian futurism somewhere off the edge of the dartboard, if it‚Äôs still even within the range of possibilities.

So, I would strongly suggest that what is needed now is radical change. However, I would prefer it not be violent revolution, because aside from that being horrific, it would likely make the situation worse before it gets better, and likely just delay solutions to what needs solving.

When I stay up at night wondering what will be the ultimate fate of this society, there is only one outcome that gives me hope. A populous uprising, through democratic means, that forces our government to change into one that benefits the common people over the interest of the elites.

The thing we are fighting, the source of all of these problems, is corruption, primarily that which has captured the two major governing parties. How well we solve this problem today will dictate how well all of the other problems rampant in our society are allowed to be fixed tomorrow.

I am working locally to institute new legislation to reform our elections, which will allow for new parties to replace the current establishment, or at least threaten them into action. However, the two-parties are largely united against this reform since it undermines their base of support. So, I have dreamt up an idea for a movement to force that change to occur faster.

It‚Äôs called Split Your Vote. It‚Äôs a bipartisan movement for people who are dissatisfied by their representation under the two-party system and want to support the growth of alternative options. Right now, support for both parties is at an all-time low, yet people are forced to support them because they see the other party as a worse alternative, so are trapped into voting for the lessor of two evils.

I‚Äôm encouraging people to pair up with trusted friends or family who are going to be voting opposite them and see if they can come to an agreement to both support third-party candidates instead. Since their votes would have cancelled out anyway, this is a way of supporting alternatives without the worry of throwing off the ratio of the two-party race. I‚Äôm hoping to generate some momentum for a mass migration of people withdrawing their support from the two-party establishment.

You can read more at [www.splityourvote.com](http://www.splityourvote.com/). If you want to help you can read through the site about how to take the pledge to join. I also just set up a subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitYourVote/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitYourVote/) if you want to assist promoting the movement.

TLDR: Society is broken because of corruption in the two major political parties, so let‚Äôs try and replace them both by triggering a mass migration away from the current establishment. The methodology of which will be people pairing up across the aisle and voting third-party, since then their votes would have cancelled out anyway, they don‚Äôt have to worry about throwing off the results of the two-party race.",conspiracy

I'll give some reasons. First is ego, t.v shows glorifying these people makes us want to emulate their behaviour, not benevolent by any means and is just virtue signaling.
Secondly, these people need to be clean. So why wear scrubs on the bus on the way to work? Why wear dirty scrubs on the way home in public. Both have contamination risks and is really foolish and unprofessional. Don't you feel grossed out seeing a chef in gear in public? I'd rather them save those clothes for work time.

We're told over 1 million russian troops were killed. Believable. In an area of about 10 square miles. Ok, a lot less believable. Then factor in that the majority of those million troops were being shuttled across the volga on tiny, slow boats. While russia was experiencing a shortage of fuel. Not believable at all. Well, maybe the germans killed the 1 million on their way across the volga? Could happen, if they had air superiority and could actually man their artillery (they couldn't, commanders at the time cited that as a huge reason for not being able to take the city; not to mention they were literally starving to death and couldn't supply their army with food, much less ammo to kill 1 million enemy). But that's just one example.
Look at iwo jima. We're told 20k japanese died there. Have you ever been there? 20k people wouldn't even fit there, let alone the 75k americans they were fighting. 
Official kia counts for individual battles don't even match up to the total for the war.

The only other explanation that physicians have given me is ""stress"". And trust me, I have been stressing. 

Anyway, I know this itself isn't a conspiracy. My point is that conspiracies are fucking with me not only mentally, but physically. I don't think I could ever fully ignore them though, I've been redpilled for about a year now and there's really no going back. I guess this means I should really just unplug for a bit. Try to disconnect and focus on other things. They put me on antivirals and steroids, so maybe I'll get insane amounts of energy and actually start doing a useful hobby, or working out.

393,The Cull,"#Submission Statement

When you know you are being lied to and you want to get to the truth, first you must dismantle the narrative. Look for what they talk about constantly. That is the smokecreen. That is the distraction to focus your attention in the wrong direction.

Next look for things they rarely mention. That is where you start digging. So, let's apply that to covid. You want the truth? Buckle up.

So, we know right from the start the health agencies were all ready to gush information about lung inflammation and the infection via ACE-2 receptors. If that was the prepared distraction, what were they using it to distract from? They were hiding a second method of infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has an alternate binding site that targets neuropilin 1 and neuropilin 2 receptors. You know what also does that? Rabies.

Neuropilin are the gateway to the central nervous system and the brain. Pathogens can use them to breach the blood brain barrier that prevents most diseases from infecting neural tissue. When you see Covid patients talking about the loss of their sense of smell for an extended length of time? That is called Anosmia. It means the virus has infected their brain and is damaging their temporal lobe. 

If all of this is not bad enough, there is more. The SARS-CoV-2 virus also has prion domains in it's spike protien. Prions are self replicating, infectious, malformed protiens that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is a neurodegenerative, 100% fatal brain disorder and we can see that virus is carrying those prions directly into neural tissue.

At least one neuro-scientist has stuck his neck out to talk about this. Kevin McCairn Ph.D. talks about it in this video. You ought to watch it and then you won't be wondering why people with inside information are double masking.

&gt;Summary: Black workers from the South migrate North during WWI to look for jobs left vacant by people going off to war. They were often relegated to the most undesirable jobs and faced some prejudice. Some of them join the local labor unions and find themselves being paid substantially more than they would have if they had stayed in the South. After the war ends, the labor union loses influence as there are men who want their jobs back that these workers filled. We see employers using race to try to break up the union and there are accurate depictions of the Chicago race riots that occurred in 1919. There were massive strikewaves after WWI when many workers were laid off or had their wages cut. This film is useful to anyone interested in the labor movement.",conspiracy
408,Flu Disappeared But No Talk About New Testing,"I don‚Äôt think many in this sub are buying that the masks and distancing have made the flu disappear, to which I agree, but I wanted to bring another possible reason for this ‚Äòdisappearance‚Äô to anyone unaware that the previous standard testing methods for the flu viruses has been changed. It‚Äôs a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the few MSM mentions I have found says ‚Äúmany labs are using a CDC-developed ""multiplex test"" that checks specimens for both the coronavirus and flu‚Äù. [https://www.foxnews.com/health/amid-covid-19-pandemic-flu-has-disappeared-in-the-us](https://www.foxnews.com/health/amid-covid-19-pandemic-flu-has-disappeared-in-the-us) (Article also mentions some doctors are not even testing for flu because they don‚Äôt **think** it‚Äôs present!)

&amp;#x200B;

And from the CDC: CDC‚Äôs Influenza SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Assay and Required Supplies: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/multiplex.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/multiplex.html)

&amp;#x200B;

These tests were granted Emergency Use Authorization. (The FDA Letter of Authorization is downloadable here: [https://www.fda.gov/media/139744/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/139744/download)). Of note, like other EUA products, is ‚ÄúThis test has not been FDA cleared or approved‚Äù.

&amp;#x200B;

And from Twist BioScience, one of at least several companies making the tests, referring to increased use of the tests: ‚ÄúSupplied the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with a customized version of Twist SARS-CoV-2 Synthetic RNA Controls for use in the CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay, an assay that tests for influenza A, B and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously. In addition to using the assay at its primary site, CDC intends to distribute this multiplex assay to additional public health laboratories for testing across the United States.‚Äù [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005935/en/Twist-Bioscience-Reports-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Financial-Results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005935/en/Twist-Bioscience-Reports-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Financial-Results)

&amp;#x200B;

Journalist Files Charges against WHO and UN for Bioterrorism and Intent to Commit Mass Murder
Natural News.com ^ | June 25, 2009 | Barbara Minton, Natrual Health Editor

Posted on 25/06/2009, 14:08:37 by NorwegianViking

(NaturalNews) As the anticipated July release date for Baxter's A/H1N1 flu pandemic vaccine approaches, an Austrian investigative journalist is warning the world that the greatest crime in the history of humanity is underway. Jane Burgermeister has recently filed criminal charges with the FBI against the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations (UN), and several of the highest ranking government and corporate officials concerning bioterrorism and attempts to commit mass murder. She has also prepared an injunction against forced vaccination which is being filed in America. These actions follow her charges filed in April against Baxter AG and Avir Green Hills Biotechnology of Austria for producing contaminated bird flu vaccine, alleging this was a deliberate act to cause and profit from a pandemic.

Summary of claims and allegations filed with FBI in Austria on June 10, 2009

In her charges, Burgermeister presents evidence of acts of bioterrorism that is in violation of U.S. law by a group operating within the U.S. under the direction of international bankers who control the Federal Reserve, as well as WHO, UN and NATO. This bioterrorism is for the purpose of carrying out a mass genocide against the U.S. population by use of a genetically engineered flu pandemic virus with the intent of causing death. This group has annexed high government offices in the U.S.

Specifically, evidence is presented that the defendants, Barack Obama, President of the U.S, David Nabarro, UN System Coordinator for Influenza, Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, Kathleen Sibelius, Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Department of Homeland Security, David de Rotschild, banker, David Rockefeller, banker, George Soros, banker, Werner Faymann, Chancellor of Austria, and Alois Stoger, Austrian Health Minister, among others, are part of this international corporate criminal syndicate which has developed, produced, stockpiled and employed biological weapons to eliminate the population of the U.S. and other countries for financial and political gain.

The charges contend that these defendants conspired with each other and others to devise, fund and participate in the final phase of the implementation of a covert international bioweapons program involving the pharmaceutical companies Baxter and Novartis. They did this by bioengineering and then releasing lethal biological agents, specifically the ""bird flu"" virus and the ""swine flu virus"" in order to have a pretext to implement a forced mass vaccination program which would be the means of administering a toxic biological agent to cause death and injury to the people of the U.S. This action is in direct violation of the Biological Weapons Anti-terrorism Act.

Burgermeister's charges include evidence that Baxter AG, Austrian subsidiary of Baxter International, deliberately sent out 72 kilos of live bird flu virus, supplied by the WHO in the winter of 2009 to 16 laboratories in four counties. She claims this evidence offers clear proof that the pharmaceutical companies and international government agencies themselves are actively engaged in producing, developing, manufacturing and distributing biological agents classified as the most deadly bioweapons on earth in order to trigger a pandemic and cause mass death.

In her April charges, she noted that Baxter's lab in Austria, one of the supposedly most secure biosecurity labs in the world, did not adhere to the most basic and essential steps to keep 72 kilos of a pathogen classified as a bioweapon secure and separate from all other substances under stringent biosecurity level regulations, but it allowed it to be mixed with the ordinary human flu virus and sent from its facilities in Orth in the Donau.

In February, when a staff member at BioTest in the Czech Republic tested the material meant for candidate vaccines on ferrets, the ferrets died. This incident was not followed up by any investigation from the WHO, EU, or Austrian health authorities. There was no investigation of the content of the virus material, and there is no data on the genetic sequence of the virus released.

In answer to parliamentary questions on May 20th, the Austrian Health Minister, Alois Stoger, revealed that the incident had been handled not as a biosecurity lapse, as it should have been, but as an offence against the veterinary code. A veterinary doctor was sent to the lab for a brief inspection.

Burgermeister's dossier reveals that the release of the virus was to be an essential step for triggering a pandemic that would allow the WHO to declare a Level 6 Pandemic. She lists the laws and decrees that would allow the UN and WHO to take over the United States in the event of pandemic. In addition, legislation requiring compliance with mandatory vaccinations would be put into force in the U.S. under conditions of pandemic declaration.

She charges that the entire ""swine flu"" pandemic business is premised on a massive lie that there is no natural virus out there that poses a threat to the population. She presents evidence leading to the belief that the bird flu and swine flu viruses have, in fact, been bioengineered in laboratories using funding supplied by the WHO and other government agencies, among others. This ""swine flu"" is a hybrid of part swine flu, part human flu and part bird flu, something that can only come from laboratories according to many experts.

WHO's claim that this ""swine flu"" is spreading and a pandemic must be declared ignores the fundamental causes. The viruses that were released were created and released with the help of WHO, and WHO is overwhelmingly responsible for the pandemic in the first place. In addition, the symptoms of the supposed ""swine flu"" are indistinguishable from regular flu or from the common cold. The ""swine flu"" does not cause death anymore often than the regular flu causes death.

Burgermeister notes that the figures for deaths reported for the ""swine flu"" are inconsistent and there is no clarity as to how the number of ""deaths"" has been documented.

There is no pandemic potential unless mass vaccinations are carried out to weaponize the flu under the guise of protecting the population. There are reasonable grounds for believing that the mandatory vaccines will be purposely contaminated with diseases that are specifically designed to cause death.

Reference is made to a licensed Novartis bird flu vaccine that killed 21 homeless people in Poland in the summer of 2008 and had as its ""primary outcome measure"" an ""adverse events rate"", thereby meeting the U.S. government's own definition of a bioweapon (a biological agent designed to cause an adverse events rate, i.e death or injury) with a delivery system (injection).

She alleges that the same complex of international pharmaceutical companies and international government agencies that have developed and released pandemic material have positioned themselves to profit from triggering the pandemic with contracts to supply vaccines. Media controlled by the group that is engineering the ""swine flu"" agenda is spreading misinformation to lull the people of the U.S. into taking the dangerous vaccine.

The people of the U.S. will suffer substantial and irreparable harm and injury if they are forced to take this unproven vaccine without their consent in accordance with the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, National Emergency Act, National Security Presidential Directive/NSPD 51, Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-20, and the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza.

In the U.S. since 2008, Burgermeister charges that those named in her allegations have implemented new and/or accelerated the implementation of laws and regulations designed to strip the citizens of the U.S. of their lawful constitutional rights to refuse an injection. These people have created or allowed provisions to remain in place that make it a criminal act to refuse to take an injection against pandemic viruses. They have imposed other excessive and cruel penalties such as imprisonment and/or quarantine in FEMA camps while barring the citizens of the U.S. from claiming compensation from injury or death from the forced injections. This is in violation of the laws governing federal corruption and the abuse of office as well as of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Through these actions, the named defendants have laid the groundwork for mass genocide.

Using the ""swine flu"" as a pretext, the defendants have preplanned the mass murder of the U.S. population by means of forced vaccination. They have installed an extensive network of FEMA concentration camps and identified mass grave sites, and they have been involved in devising and implementing a scheme to hand power over the U.S. to an international crime syndicate that uses the UN and WHO as a front for illegal racketeering influenced organized crime activities, in violation of the laws that govern treason.

She further charges that the complex of pharmaceutical companies consisting of Baxter, Novartis and Sanofi Aventis are part of a foreign-based dual purpose bioweapons program, financed by this international criminal syndicate and designed to implement mass murder to reduce the world's population by more than 5 billion people in the next ten years. Their plan is to spread terror to justify forcing people to give up their rights, and to force mass quarantine in FEMA camps. The houses, companies and farms and lands of those who are killed will be up for grabs by this syndicate.

By eliminating the population of North America, the international elite gain access to the region's natural resources such as water and undeveloped oil lands. And by eliminating the U.S. and its democratic constitution by subsuming it under a North American Union, the international crime group will have total control over North America.

Highlights from the complete dossier

The complete dossier of the June 10th action is a 69 page document presenting evidence to substantiate all charges. This includes:

Factual background that delineates time lines and facts that establish probable cause, UN and WHO definitions and roles, and history and incidents from the April, 2009 ""swine flu"" outbreak.

Evidence the ""swine flu"" vaccines are defined as bioweapons as delineates in government agencies and regulations classifying and restricting vaccines, and the fear of foreign countries that ""swine flu"" vaccines will be used for biological warfare.

Scientific evidence the ""swine flu"" virus is an artificial (genetic) virus.

Scientific evidence the ""swine flu"" was bioengineered to resemble the Spanish flu virus of 1918 including quotes from Swine Flu 2009 is Weaponized 1918 Spanish Flu by A. True Ott, Ph.D., N.D., and a Science Magazine report from Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger et.al.

The genome sequence of the ""swine flu""

Evidence of the deliberate release of the ""swine flu"" in Mexico

Evidence as to the involvement of President Obama that delineates his trip to Mexico which coincided with the recent ""swine flu"" outbreak and the death of several officials involved in his trip. Contention is made that the President was never tested for ""swine flu"" because he had been previously vaccinated.

Evidence as to the role of Baxter and WHO in producing and releasing pandemic virus material in Austria includes a statement from a Baxter official stating the accidentally distributed H5N1 in the Czech Republic was received from a WHO reference center. This includes delineation of evidence and allegations from Burgermeister's charges filed in April in Austria that are currently under investigation.

Evidence Baxter is an element in a covert bioweapons network

Evidence Baxter has deliberately contaminated vaccine material.

Evidence Novartis is using vaccines as bioweapons

Evidence as to WHO's role in the bioweapons program

Evidence as to WHO's manipulation of disease data in order to justify declaring a Pandemic Level 6 in order to seize control of the USA.

Evidence as to the FDA's role in covering up the bioweapons program

Evidence as to Canada's National Microbiology Lab's role in the bioweapons program.

Evidence of the involvement of scientists working for the UK's NIBSC, and the CDC in engineering the ""swine flu"".

Evidence vaccinations caused the Spanish killer flu of 1918 including belief of Dr. Jerry Tennant that the widespread use of aspirin during the winter that followed the end of World War I could have been a key factor contributing to the earlier pandemic by suppressing the immune system and lowering body temperatures, allowing the flu virus to multiply. Tamiflu and Relenza also lower body temperatures, and therefore can also be expected to contribute to the spread of a pandemic.

Evidence as to manipulation of the legal framework to allow mass murder with impunity.

Constitutional issues: the legality vs. illegality of jeopardizing the life, health and public good by mass vaccinations.

The issue of immunity and compensation as evidence of intent to commit a crime.

Evidence as to the existence of an international corporate crime syndicate.

Evidence of the existence of the ""Illuminati"".

Evidence as to the depopulation agenda of the Illuminati/Bilderbergs and their involvement in the engineering and release of the artificial ""swine flu"" virus.

Evidence that weaponized flu was discussed at the annual Bilderberg meeting in Athens from May 14-17, 2009, as part of their agenda of genocide, including a list of attendees who, according to a statement once made by Pierre Trudeau, view themselves as genetically superior to the rest of humanity.

Media is keeping Americans clueless about the threat they are under

Jane Burgermeister is a dual Irish/Austrian who has written for Nature, the British Medical Journal, and American Prospect. She is the European Correspondent of the Renewable Energy World website. She has written extensively about climate change, biotechnology, and the ecology.

In addition to the charges currently under investigation that she filed against Baxter AG and Avir Green Hills Biotechnology in April, she has filed charges against WHO and Baxter among others concerning a case of exploding ""swine flu"" vials meant for a research lab on a busy IC train in Switzerland.

In her view, control of the media by the ruling elite has allowed the world crime syndicate to further its agenda unabated while the rest of the people remain in the dark about what is really going on. Her charges are an attempt to get around this media control and bring the truth to light.

Her greatest concern is that ""in spite of the fact Baxter has been caught red handed nearly triggering pandemic, they are also moving ahead, together with allied pharma companies, with supplying the vaccine for pandemics."" Baxter is hurrying to get this vaccine to market some time in July.",conspiracy

492,A question on the time keeping of ancient sites and cathedrals and passing of knowledge.,"TLDR/Question: Why is such knowledge kept hidden? Is it standard for most of the civilization to be unaware? If so, why? If not, why have the elite stopped the flow information? What changed? 

----

BACKGROUND:

Many ancient sites and cathedrals hold within their geographic location, physical dimension and construction, a reference or relationship to mathematical universal constants and cycles of our galaxy, planet and solar system. Most notably, the Precession (approx. 26,000 years) and a Zodiac (approx. 1/12 of a Precession). 

The most understood link of these times seems to correlate with the change of climate and the impact of human civilizations across the globe; similar to descriptions of cataclysms and disasters found in myths, stories, and many religions. 

Regardless of what the time keeping matched with, these sites were developed in different eras and peoples, yet they all count the same thing in a similar manner. The civilizations are separated by time and cultures but the knowledge still remained. This knowledge was either rediscovered every time (unlikely) or being passed down. I believe the latter is more likely because the methodology (geographic significance and Giza profile) to achieve the same time keeping remained constant despite contemporary differences and technological capabilities. From this point, you can infer there was some greater practice to carry on this knowledge for whatever reason.

Now here's where it connects back to conspiracy theory. Whatever the event(s) may have been, the successors/survivors must have at least included the people with such knowledge. It is often theorized the modern day elite are more aware than what has been discovered. If this is the case, it would follow the elite are part of the the lineage (not necessarily in the ancestral sense) of these timekeeping bearers. 

Question: Why is such knowledge kept hidden? Is it standard for most of the civilization to be unaware? If so, why? If not, why have the elite stopped the flow information? What changed?

Note: This question is applies to a wide range of topics.",conspiracy

I believe that the spokesperson, Nancy Lieder, a human representative and explainer to the rest of us, has been sharing Zeta information since the mid 1990s. It's one of the longest running conspiracy theory, warning type rabbit holes that I have explored. At first I was intrigued. The overlap to Alien reveals, the Nibiru planet legend, Pole Shift science, and other bits and pieces made it fun to devour. I followed their website, (zetatalk . com) and continue to read updates to this day. Over time, I noticed how the platform included more and more political pieces. I also noticed how the predictions, the dire warnings of the end of the world, or at least the drastic changes associated with the Events, shared dates that continually pushed forward into the future. Goal posts moving seems to be an ongoing theme, not just with this prediction oriented group but with many of the prophet type conspiracies. I never knew back when I was a young conspiracy aficionado , learning about Y2K, Zetas and Nibiru, and the December 21, 2020 end of the world, and others, that the information would end up being so fluid, and the deadlines so easily moved.

I really like the idea that the soul gets to choose Service to Self or Service to Others. That's something I learned during this adventure. It doesn't matter if the soul originated in our timeline or another, our dimension or another, or if you believe there are thousands on thousands of 'others' out there with souls, the rules are basic. Serving self, or serving others. 

Just because I question the date setters doesn't necessarily mean I'm questioning the data presented. I can have a faith that's solid even when the humans who present their point of view end up being sketchy with details. But at what point do the details' accuracy end up cancelling the whole deal?

Y2K never came to fruition. December 21, the stars didn't align in such a way that tumbled some of the stars into our oceans. So those are clear examples of answers. With the Zeta predictions, the information has appeal. Some of the legends overlap other rabbit hole explorings I've done. But ultimately...?

Have you ever researched Nibiru? Considered the science behind Pole Shifts, the giant calderas erupting in Yellowstone, the Biblical predictions and dates associated like the December 21, 2020 thing? Then had those ideas twisted or simply not proven true, and had you question your overall investment in the conspiracy travels your mind enjoys?",conspiracy

528,"500,000 COVID deaths, but over 300,000 could have been prevented","  

**The Story of how FAUCI and Public Health Blocked Early Home COVID Treatment and Killed Over 300,000**

Joel S. Hirschhorn

Americans have every right to be in a fit over the news that 500,000 Americans have died from the COVID-19 infection. Hard to imagine worse news. What is missing from this news is that way over 300,000 of these deaths could have been prevented through the widespread use of cheap, safe and proven early home treatments that in the US and worldwide have been used successfully. Details on these treatments and the generic medicines, including hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, and supplements, including zinc, quercetin and vitamin D, used by courageous doctors are in the new book **PANDEMIC BLUNDER ‚Äì FAUCI AND PUBLIC HEALTH BLOCKED EARLY HOME COVID TREATMENT.**

One of the pioneers that created a widely used protocol nearly a year ago, Dr. Zelenko, wrote the Foreword for the book.

The book is discussed in a new [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/user-694711047/the-media-and-fauci-blocked-successful-covid-19-treatments-guest-joel-hirschhorn) that tells the story of why the book was written, mainly to save lives. And it is now available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pandemic-Blunder-Public-Blocked-Treatment/dp/197723822X/ref=nav_ya_signin?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Pandemic+Blunder&amp;qid=1612289098&amp;sr=8-1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;captcha_verified=1&amp;) as a cheap Kindle edition and a paperback,

Pandemic blunder is defined as the failure of the United States public health system and federal agencies to support and promote early home/outpatient treatment for the COVID-19 pandemic disease. Considerable medical information and data convincingly show that when given early a number of proven safe, cheap generic medicines and protocols knock out the coronavirus. Early means within the first few days of getting symptoms or a positive test. Risking condemnation, a relatively few pioneering and courageous doctors have been using innovative approaches to prevent their covid patients from needing hospital care and facing death. Many expert views of doctors support the view that 70 percent to 80 percent of covid deaths could have been prevented ‚Äì and still can for future victims of the disease. But the vast majority of US doctors are following the dictates of NIH and FDA that behind the scene are driven by Dr. Anthony Fauci, who does not deserve the endless praise by the mainstream press. Major medical societies also follow the misguided actions by the federal agencies.

This book does more than describe the pandemic blunder, particularly in terms of the influence of Dr. Anthony Fauci. It can help Americans protect their lives by not being victimized by disinformation and propaganda from leftist media. Pandemic management has failed because of corrupt forces aiming to make billions of dollars from expensive medicines and vaccines. There has been widespread dereliction of duty on the part of many local, state and federal government officials that continue to refuse all the data supporting early home treatment and prevention. Contrary to the entire history of medicine early treatment of any illness or disease has been subverted to promote expensive hospital treatment that has resulted in the 500,000 COVID deaths. This is medical malpractice at a historic high level. All those refusing to support early home treatment are guilty of criminally negligent homicide, a claim that many have made against New York governor Andrew Cuomo.

The way to change the government restrictions on early home treatments for COVID is for the public to fully understand what has been denied them and to demand the medical freedom of all doctors to use what is best for their patients.",conspiracy
529,Covid and the new concept of social bubbles,"Today I learned about something new they are implementing. It's called : social bubbles. 

[It's explicitly described on the Indiana gov. website](https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/files/20_COVID-19-social%20bubbles%2011.16.20.pdf)

Political leaders in France and Belgium talked about it, and are trying to implement it, tO sToP tHe PaNdEmIc.

[Remember this interesting interview of Vaclav Klaus, former PM of the Czech republic ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmYFQRGPNnY). He says at 4:00 in the interview that the first thing they noticed during the communist era is they were trying to isolate people, ""erase as much as possible horizontal relations"". He says it's all about fear and control.

Covid is the pretext to implement communism, at a global scale this time, so we have nowhere to escape.

When you comply, and if you take the vaccine, you're stuck, you will have no choice but to get along with these rules. Especially when they combine it with CBDC. You won't even be allowed to see your own child or your grandma, because that would mean too many people in your social bubble LOL. Before you know it, what makes you human (personal interrelationships) is no more. Before you know it, you're on xanax. And once they control you this way because you're so weak emotionally, you will accept anything they require that will restrict you rights even more, and you will thank your persecutor for it, because they will allow you to exceptionally add 1 or 2 more individuals in your social bubble in return.

&gt;*Office of the International Entente Against the Third International*   
Geneva, March 1926   


[The Red Terror](https://cdm21047.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/russian/id/6384)

&gt;The terrorist doctrine of the leaders of the Bolshevist International: 

* Ninety per cent of Russians may perish so long as ten per cent. remain at the time of the world revolution. (Lenin.) 
* You object to the gentle terror which we practice against our class enemies, but know this, that in a month at latest this terror will take on a crueller form. (Trotsky.) 
* Pitiless repression is necessary, banishing all sentimentality. (Lounatcharsky \[ Lunacharsky \]) 
* We represent organised terror... we know no quarter. (Dzerginsky. \[ Dzerzhinsky \]) 
* We shall carry on organised terror. If you notice a bourgeois escaping the eye, vigilant, as it is, of our organisation, catch him and kill him with your own hands. If you see a revolutionary socialist of the right, a menchevik \[ menshevik \], or any kind of traitor, succeed in hiding himself kill him too.(Lassovsky.) 
* We were terrorists at the beginning of the revolution and even before, and we always shall be. We need leaders who feel nothing but mortal hatred towards the bourgeoisie; who organise and prepare the proletariat for an implacable struggle; who do not hesitate to use the most violent means towards those who stand in their way. It is the bitterest civil war that history has ever known. (Zinovieff. \[ Zinoviev \]) 
* The Cheka does not judge its enemies; it strikes them down without pity and suppresses any who are not on the same side of the fence. (Latzis.) 
* With the Red Army, the detachments of the extraordinary commission constitute the glory and beauty of the communist party. (Zinovieff.)   


&gt;The Cheka, which is now known as the G.P.U., is the instrument through which the bolshevist leaders carry out their terrorist doctrines. It is at one and the same time a surety police, a political police, an organ of counter-espionage, and an extraordinary tribunal, without public ministry or defence, or judges worthy of the name. It possesses special detachments in each centre, has a special service of executioners and administers the prisons.   
&gt;  
&gt;All the organisms of the Cheka are directed by members of the communist party. The special personnel is recruited among liberated convicts, robbers and assassins, among the agents of the ""Ochrana"", among degenerates and intellectual perverts.   
&gt;  
&gt;The personnel of the Cheka is composed of Jews, Russians, Letts, Poles, Armenians, Hungarians, the scum of every race.   
&gt;  
&gt;It is the √©lite of evildoers to whom the soviet government has given power of life and death. It is this Cheka, this G.P.U. which has been and is still the pillar of bolshevism. Bieloborodoff, Dzerjinsky's assistant, has declared: ""Terror is at the base of the soviet power.  
&gt;  
&gt;If we suppress the Cheka,"" said the congress of the Russian communist party, ""the power of the soviets cuts the branch on which it sits.   
&gt;  
&gt;This formidable organisation is divided into a number of sections, sub-sections and organs of various descriptions: general sections for action, information, finance, transport, etc. They are all under the orders of Unschlicht, who comes immediately under Dzerjinsky \[ Dzerzhinsky \]. The G.P.U. has numerous sections in nearly every foreign country charged with spying and terrorist activities. 

[Head of the CheKa, the monster, Dzerzhinsky](https://preview.redd.it/8b1ugyciq1k61.png?width=329&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baca1dfcebec6c46e22cf9a24082ca5bc1012fd3)

&gt;The chief of the Cheka, Dzerjinsky, who in addition occupies one of the highest posts in the soviet administration, is the most odious of the whole band of bolshevik criminals. The streams of innocent blood which he has caused to flow, and the innumerable tortures he has inflicted on millions of victims will never be forgotten.   
&gt;  
&gt;Here, in a few words, are some brief sketches of some of Dzerjinsky's \[ Dzerzhinsky's \] underlings (Dzerzhinsky was a Polish Jew whose father changed the family name in a successful bid for Polish nobility).   
&gt;  
&gt;Sarokine is a rough and uncultivated person who plays the dandy. He treats prisoners as slaves and dirt, but he rarely shoots them himself.   
&gt;  
&gt;Advokine is fond of dress. All he wears is noticeably new and his hands flash with jewels. He is a cocaine addict.   
&gt;  
&gt;Tschernavski, cocaine maniac, had always to kill a certain number of victims or he was not happy.   
&gt;  
&gt;Rosa Schwarz at Kieff \[ Kiev \], who counted her victims by hundreds, took cocaine, and, cigarette in mouth, went to see the prisoners naked in their cells and killed them with a revolver shot or burned their eyes with her cigarette.   
&gt;  
&gt;Deutsch, who, at Odessa, organised the shame of women and assassination of men, was decorated with the order of the Red Flag.   
&gt;  
&gt;Terrihochoff, shot prisoners by moonlight in the gardens of the Cheka.   
&gt;  
&gt;Who were the chiefs of the Cheka at Odessa? Several Jews, some Chinese and a negro whose speciality was to pull the tendons of his victims while watching their faces and showing his white teeth in a broad smile.   
&gt;  
&gt;One could continue this enumeration indefinitely.   
&gt;  
&gt;The agents of the Cheka ‚Äî subalterns, commandants, gaolers, executioners, feared by all, wearing Wellington boots and leather jerkins, and carrying revolvers at their waists ‚Äî go wherever they please. They have free railway passes and free food and lodging. They lead a life of debauch and are bound to their immediate chiefs and the soviet government by the terrible fellowship of crime.",conspiracy

564,"The ""loose control"" theory","This is basically a theory that I've come up with after watching everything unfold the past 5-6 years.  Basically, the idea is that there are groups of elites who have agendas and different things they want to do for personal reasons or otherwise, but they don't necessarily have ""absolute"" power over everything.   They just have enough power to generally accomplish what they need to.   For example, a common theme is people saying how every single election is rigged and there is no way someone gets in if they weren't chosen.   However, if you actually look back at the past 20 or so years of elections pretty much always Soros got his guy in as the democrat nominee as well as the republican nominee.  There is no real difference whether John Mccain or Obama won the presidency when they're both working for the same person, so there was no need to rig anything beyond that point.  

The second thing I want to talk about is who gets ""suicided"".   Generally the people who actually end up going this route are unimportant people to the public who get close to exposing something actually serious.   Dissenters with unpopular opinions almost NEVER get suicided even if they might be annoying, they just get discredited.  This leads me to believe that there is generally not a group crushing all dissent with absolutely no mercy, but if you get too close to dangerous territory you're gone.  

I feel like if you actually take a look at everything and view it through this lens of being part of an agenda or plan but not part of a perfect plan, it makes a lot more sense.  For example, if you get 100 elites in a room and get them to talk about depopulation, I doubt you can get all of them to actually agree on it or the best method.   People are too independent and selfish and it only makes sense that some of them will dissent or do things for various reasons.",conspiracy

The problem is, nobody asked them to do that, just like how nobody asked for most ""woke"" changes that corporations are making. The real reason they're doing this is, as always, because of money. Millennials are more ""woke"" than their parents, and now they're the ones buying toys for their own kids, so companies like Hasbro are trying to win out that demographic with socially conscious toys.

In this regard, it's kind of an unintended conspiracy, because while Hasbro's objective is profit, the end result is social division. Personally, I don't really care which imaginary chromosomes the plastic potato has, but I wish people would see through the bullshit smokescreen and realize that these actions are corporations capitalizing on conflict, and not something the left is actively trying to do or care about.

There are plenty of examples of actual forced ""wokeness"", but examples like these take away from them, and fuel a cycle of division and conflict from which large corporations are extracting millions of dollars.

Here me out 

New Zealand after having a event full consists of a T20 match in a stadium ,the stadium went full . All people came out to watch and seats were full . (Re-open lockdown)

Now after the match everyone thought well what a match ,I should have gone  to the next match seeing the result win by 5 runs when both teams total scored 400 runs in 40 overs . (Those who don't know Cricket its basically in anlaogy wise 1 chance you can score upto 6 points  ,1 over has 6 chances )( lot of money for corporation)

But here comes the divide part the people(let's call them A) who didn't went might after seeing the whole packed stadium( let's call them B) may have started doubt of these lockdown ,covid , vaccination efficacy ,vaccine liability, vaccine side effects ,masks not required etc because common sense is when you saw it in front of your own üëÄ.(people in doubts)

But suddenly those people doubts of these things are removed by government putting a 7 day lockdown after the match and next match goes without audience. (Conquer A doubts ) now  back to believing that lockdown was right in first place and people like B are stupid breaking these lockdown etc (loss of jobs and economy and increase in brainwashing to believe )

we know that players(let's call them C) are unaffected because of the money related to TV companies related where people can't answer why not a single player died . I think they are immortal to covid . (Common sense which people ignore )

Divide it into A B and C .... and do as you wish 
A will take the vaccine themselves since they believe in govt doing right for them 
B will keep on shouting that there's no covid because well they personally believe it and will be labelled as anarchist of society, later will be blamed for spreading covid etc and will be censored everywhere
C will just work for money ‚ò∫Ô∏è(goal achieved)

I think this will happen again and again ü§£ü§£ü§£ everywhere from now

If you're worried about children being raised as the wrong gender, consider David Reimer. David was the victim of a botched circumcision (much more common than you would think) and doctors recommended that he be raised as a girl. David experienced intense depression and gender dysphoria and transitioned back to male as a teenager. Eventually he took his own life.

Rand Paul is a coward. He wants to talk about transgender issues because that will get him praise from the right-wing press, but going after circumcision would have the exact same conservative outfits label him an anti-Semite and cause him to lose access to certain funding networks for his re-election campaigns. He pretends to be a principled doctor standing up for the rights of children, but he won't take a stand against mutilating the genitals of babies. He's just another politicians trying to get some good TV coverage for his inevitable presidential campaign.

The mystics and shamans of the annulus of history show us that there is a path to be follow, we just happen to live in a time when discerning this truth from the nonsense is becoming harder and harder due to the advancement of what we like to call technology.

Opinion has trumped fact which in turn has left the common man trapped in a cage of his own making adorned with the colours of his chosen clan. Posters on the wall, bookshelves full of dusty tomes, clothing displaying team iconography all reinforce this comfortable yet oppressive womb like headspace the majority of consumers reside in.

Brush off identification and ask yourself what is the truth.

Due to this ongoing situation I have taken it upon myself to attempt to find a remedy.
This effort has culminated in what I have dubbed ‚ÄúThe New Shamanic‚Äù.

In short, The New Shamanic is a body of work that will span many different types of media in the attempt to provide the consumer with an arsenal of philosophical and artistic tools to navigate the ever deepening myriad of mental issues human beings have to put up with on a daily basis.

664,"The exact process by which currency is created and manipulated is not generally well understood, but might be the most important aspect of maintaining cabal power. How currency is actually created. (Repost of /u/letsbebuns)","I propose that it would be superior to fix the currency system and replace it with something honest. Open-source rules that are clear and simple and available to all for viewing.

While some people have proposed eliminating currency altogether, I think that completely eliminating currency would result in:

1) a lot of problems in the transition period

2) a lot of human behavior problems in the post-scarcity period

3) How does one eliminate currency without slipping into communism, which doesn't work?

I propose that fixing the currency system is easier to implement than eliminating it entirely. Currency is nothing but tokens, representations of value. An honest currency system has not been tried in our lifetime! We have no frame of reference for what it would be like to earn a little bit of money and have it keep its value forever.

The major problems with currency are like this:

#DEBT BASED CURRENCY:

All ""money"" currently in circulation is debt. Federal Reserve Notes (FRN) are purchased by the government from a private bank called the federal reserve. The supreme court (united states vs gonzalez) decided that the federal reserve is a privately owned bank in 1983. So when the govt needs to enter more money into circulation, even though they have the legal authority to issue it (scrip) straight out of the treasury, or to mint it through the bureau of printing and engraving, instead they go to this private bank and take out a loan. The loan has interest attached to it. That money enters circulation, and the debt runs.

This is problematic for several reasons. First of all, it's unnecessary debt. The govt gave away their power to print money to someone else (they are authorized to print money but not to give the power away) and then they go into debt to receive something that they gave away in the first place.

Second of all, that means that whatever value enters circulation, then that means an equal amount of debt plus interest. (.6%)

What does this mean?

It means the US govt owes more money than is in circulation. They owe over 100% of the money in circulation. This is why it is said that the currency of the USA is ""DEBT BASED CURRENCY""

#FRACTIONAL RESERVE LENDING:

The above is bad enough. But now hear this: You give bank $100. They have $100 on the books now. Under fractional reserve lending, they are legally able to CREATE money out of nothing based on their holdings.

If a new person comes in and wants a loan, they are able to create new money (debt) at a 9:1 ratio. This is confusing, but it means from the original $100, they are able to lend out $90 of it, earning interest on that 90$, while at the same time telling the original investor that their entire 100$ is still in the bank.

If that guy who took the loan for 90$ goes and puts it in another bank, that bank can also make more loans at the same 9:1 ratio. Meaning they can loan out $81 dollars while still telling the guy they have the original $90 still on the books. If the guy who took out the loan for $81 dollars wants to put that in a new bank, the new bank can loan $73 while still telling him they have the original $81 on the books.

If you continue these loans until the amount is too low to loan, then from that original $100 dollar investment, the bankers can spawn almost $1,000 in new currency. The problem is, all of this new currency is in the form of a loan to a bank. It's $900 of new debt entering the economy on a $100 real money investment. They loaned out money they never had and are collecting interest on it!

And this is separate from the fact that ALL the currency is backed by debt, as shown in the first section. These two issues COMPOUND each other.

#FIAT CURRENCY

Fiat is latin for ""Let it be"" and ""Fiat Lux"" means ""Let there be light"". In the world of currency, Fiat currency is called such because it is designated currency by an authority, not because it has an intrinsic value. When items have an intrinsic value, they are not a FIAT currency. Fiat currencies are entered into circulation by an authority, not by nature.

Fiat currencies are not always bad, but they have the potential to become bad, because they are synthetic and made by man. Therefore the rules which govern them are obviously subject to the appetites of man. You can make any rule you want and add it to a fiat currency.

In the USA, the constitution requires the government to use gold and silver. However, the government of previous generations (before any of us were alive) didn't follow this and created a situation where the economy was inflated with fiat scrip. Due to the presence of so much scrip, the economy can probably never go back to the way it used to be. It has been artificially inflated way too high and the correction would be egregious.

Most modern thinkers agree that the best way to handle the fiat currency situation is not to enforce the old ways, but learn the lessons from them instead. Study the Tallystick system, perhaps the most famous currency system of the ancient world, wherein the King took boughs of wood and carved unique lines into them. Then, he split the bough in half and kept one side in his castle while entering the opposing side into circulation among the people. Pretty good so far, right?

The final step was to make the king's taxes payable in the tallystick. You could discharge your monetary duty to the king by simply giving him a stick (which had originated with him). This instantly made the sticks very valuable and people accepted them as currency overnight. No gold necessary - just a stick. The tallystick system flourished for over 700 years.

#SOLUTIONS

1) Obviously the biggest problem is that the federal reserve met on christmas eve 1913 without a quorum present in senate and passed their unlawful charter. Since then americans have not owned their money, but instead they borrow it from a private bank and they pay interest for the privilege of using currency. Seeing as how the Divine Creator as well as the United States Constitution allows for the government of the people to handle this themselves, there is really no reason to rely on a ""for profit"" bank to provide this service.

2) The second biggest problem is that the currency doesn't hold its value and is debt-based. This is by design. It's annoying, because, let's say you work 8 hours and you can buy 8 sandwiches as a result. However, you stick that money under your mattress for 6 months, and suddenly you can only buy 7 sandwiches with that money. If you wait years, you might only be able to buy 4 sandwiches instead of the original 8. That's pretty jacked up, because the number of hours you worked to earn that purchasing power didn't change. You worked the number of hours necessary to purchase 8 sandwiches! You don't get your time back when inflation strikes...

It's actually really easy to keep a currency at the same value. Silver has kept identical purchasing power for the last 100 years. You could buy the same amount of sandwiches with a silver quarter in 1925 as you can today. The only thing that changes is the value of silver in FRNs. The value of silver is not changing - the value of the FRN is. Crazy, right?

I don't recommend going to a global standard of metals for exchange, but the lessons that can be learned there are invaluable. They prove it's possible to keep purchasing power identical for 100+ years.

And the currency needs to go back into the hands of the people's government. Eliminate the private banks from government entirely.

3) Eliminate Usury from the issuance of currency entirely. THIS ALONE WOULD BE LIKE GIVING THE WORLD TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS

There is a lot more but this post is getting a bit long. Basically the problem is not money, but the fact that the money has been completely corrupted and used as a weapon.

As you can see here, the entire currency system is set up from top to bottom to steal from people.

Fixing the inherent theft is the superior path.

But I watched one of his most viewed live performances of this song and something seemed strange about it. 

He seems very hesitant to say ""My Way"". At one point even pauses, and shakes his head ""no"" just before saying ""My Way"". 

And if you listen to they lyrics. It's no so much that he did it ""His way"", rather he did ""what he had to do"". 

There is a deep rabbit hole around celebrities and ""Selling your soul"". Sinatra being one of the biggest recording artists of all time, if the theories are true, would have certainly been part of that. (Whatever that may be).

0:54 he shakes his head ""no"" before saying ""My Way""

1:13 He says ""I did what I had to do""

1:42 He stops, looks to his left, and takes a longer pause than should be taken for the song before saying ""My way"". 

Knowing what we know now about how the music industry works, and how awful it is to the artists. Could this live performance have shown Frank having some difficulty singing the song while knowing he was never in charge of his actions or career?

743,My theory that the House Majority Leader's plane was bombed in 1972 and the CIA covered it up,"### Preface

**Note** ‚Äì I cannot emphasize enough that **this is a highly speculative theory with very little supporting evidence.** That said, it's at least plausible so I'm posting here for my own reference in the future, for your feedback, and for others to build upon.

**Background** ‚Äì If you aren't familiar with the story, a twin-engine Cessna 310 transporting two congressmen (one was the House Majority Leader) went missing somewhere between Anchorage and Juneau on October 16th, 1972.

**Bomb Theory** ‚Äì The easy explanation is that it crashed due to weather, mechanical failure, pilot error, etc. That's still the leading theory but there is [some evidence](https://www.planeandpilotmag.com/news/pilot-talk/2020/09/23/did-a-bomb-bring-down-the-begich-boggs-flight/) to suggest that the plane was bombed by the mob in an attempt to gain control over Alaskan politics during the lucrative oil boom that was happening at the time. Even if the wreck had been found, it would look like an assassination of the House Majority Leader (who also served on the Warren Commission) while the actual target (the congressman from Alaska) would be presumed to be collateral damage.

**Sources** ‚Äì Everything I know stemmed from the recent [Missing in Alaska podcast](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-missing-in-alaska-62503099/), which chronicles something like 7 years of the host investigating this story. I'm not part of the podcast, just a fan. If reading is more your thing, here is probably the most up-to-date and comprehensive article available: [1972 Cessna 310C Alaska Disappearance](https://www.planeandpilotmag.com/news/pilot-talk/2020/09/21/1972-cessna-310c-alaska-disappearance/)

-----

### Assumptions

My theory relies on the sole assumption that the plane should have been found. To quote the Missing in Alaska podcast, Tail End episode, 2:45 timestamp:

&gt; In 1972, Air Force Major Henry Stocker, the search commander, told reporters ""95% to 99% of what we are looking for, we locate."" ""Of the previous 1,200 planes to disappear,"" one official said ""only three had never been found."" ... An Air Force document I obtained says ... ""Their probability of detection of the aircraft, if intact in the search area, was in excess of 97%. The probability of locating aircraft wreckage or survivors without fires or signaling devices was in excess of 95% in all search areas and in excess of 99% in the highest probability area.""

You could call the accuracy of the above statements into question but I'm going to take them at face value for the purposes of this theory, which leaves me with the possibilities below.

-----

# Possibilities

1. It's just bad luck that the plane was never found.

2. The plane crashed outside of the search area.

3. The plane was searched for less effectively than previous missing planes.

4. The pilot did not want to be found.

5. The plane was found but kept secret.

Here are my thoughts on each of those possibilities:

1. **Bad luck** ‚Äì It is certainly possible that the plane simply crashed going through Portage Pass, slid into a crevice, and was never seen again. Some variant of crashing in a hard-to-find way is generally accepted as the most likely explanation. There was bad weather that would have contributed to a crash and also hindered search efforts. That said, the pilot was highly experienced and there's reason to believe that the plane may have had several de-icing and anti-icing devices. Not to mention this was one of the largest search efforts ever at the time. All of this is covered in great detail in the podcast so I won't dwell on it. Suffice to say, it is an unlikely combination that this particular plane crashed in the first place AND was never found during the massive search or in the 48 years since.

2. **Outside search area** ‚Äì The pilot would sometimes stray from proper flight paths but the search area was expansive and as far as I'm aware, there's no reason to believe the plane crashed outside of the enormous search area.

3. **The search was lacking** ‚Äì The search was exhaustive but it may have been inferior to other missing plane searches due to weather or if the plane crashed in a way that searchers weren't expecting. If it exploded due to a bomb, for example, the wreckage might be hard to recognize. Also, the plane probably didn't have an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) but the quote above specifically mentions a 95% or better chance of finding the plane wreckage even without signaling devices or survivors. All things considered, I think the search was at least as comprehensive as other missing plane searches, if not significantly more comprehensive.

4. **Pilot didn't want to be found** ‚Äì This would either mean the plane landed somewhere and all four occupants lived the rest of their lives in secrecy or that the pilot was suicidal and crashed in a hard-to-find place on purpose, possibly outside the search area. I'm mentioning it here for completeness but there is no evidence at all to support either of these possibilities.

5. **Plane was found but kept secret** ‚Äì In my opinion, this is the only viable explanation aside from #1 above. Possibility #1 is the simplest (Occam's razor) but it has already been explored in great detail by my sources.

For this theory, I will look at possibility #5.

-----

### Theory: The plane was found but kept secret.

Consider the following timeline, all times in Alaska Time and sources cited at the end:

* Oct 16, 8:59am ‚Äì Cessna 310 departs Anchorage for Juneau ([NTSB Aircraft Accident Report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR7301.pdf))

* Oct 16, 9:09am ‚Äì Last known communication with the plane (NTSB Aircraft Accident Report)

* Oct 16, 1:45pm ‚Äì Search efforts for the aircraft begin (NTSB Aircraft Accident Report)

* Oct 17, 4:30pm ‚Äì A tipster in California calls the Coast Guard, saying his friend has access to experimental electronic equipment and that the plane is close to Malaspina Glacier. The tipster is very specific, describing the exact location and even the number of survivors. This tip was followed up on and taken seriously due to his rational demeanor and military ties (Missing in Alaska podcast, The Search episode, timestamp 36:45 + [email correspondence](https://i.ibb.co/gMXQQj6/MIA-Email.png) with the host to clarify the likely time of the call)

My theory is that the California tipster was leaked the location of the crash by a friend in the CIA or some other member of the US Intelligence Community. In 1972, the Cold War was in full force and the US Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) network was well developed, including hydrophone arrays along the California coast as well as Adak, Alaska. This is the same Pacific Ocean network that was used to locate the Soviet submarine K-129 four years earlier. From the [SOSUS Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSUS):

&gt; Acoustic data from four Air Force AFTAC sites and the Adak, Alaska SOSUS array triangulated a potential event location to within 5 nautical miles, a site hundreds of miles away from where the Soviet Navy had been searching.

In addition to this network, there appear to be many other SOSUS-related projects that were being tested in the waters surrounding Alaska during that time. This makes sense with how close it is to Russia. Of particular interest are:

* [PARKA II &amp; Sea Spider](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b020846.pdf)

* [Missile Impact Locating System (MILS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Impact_Location_System)

Some of these hydrophone projects may even remain classified to this day, since submarines near the US mainland are still very much a military concern. For that reason, it's impossible to know how sensitive the sensors might be and how close they might have been to the crash site. That said, I think it's plausible that the plane would have been picked up by one of these sensors if it crashed into the water. A good portion (if not most) of the flight path crossed over the water. The CIA wouldn't bother to pour through hydrophone data for any other missing plane but with the House Majority Leader missing, it's almost certain that they would have. They pulled out all the stops for this search, including the SR-71 spy plane and highly classified spy satellites:

* [GIF](https://i.ibb.co/x5NCtk9/KH-9-Oct-17-20-1972.gif) showing 3 groupings (72 photos in total) of the search area taken two days after the plane's disappearance by a KH-9 spy sat. That area of Alaska wasn't photographed by a KH-9 again until four photos were taken in 1976 and the area was never photographed in such detail again during the entire run of the KH-9 program, which ended in 1984.

-----

### Why was it kept secret?

So if the CIA knew where the plane was, why didn't they tell anyone? Well here are the possibilities, assuming the CIA found the plane:

1. There was a bomb on the plane and it was planted by the CIA. The mob had nothing to do with it and the CIA kept the plane secret to cover their operation.

2. There was a bomb on the plane and it was planted by the CIA. The mob was manipulated to make it look like they did it and the CIA kept the plane secret to cover their operation.

3. There was a bomb on the plane. The CIA directly worked with the mob to facilitate the bombing and then kept the plane secret to cover their operation.

4. There was a bomb on the plane. The CIA didn't communicate with the mob but took steps to ensure that the bombing happened and then kept the plane secret to cover their operation.

5. There was a bomb on the plane. The CIA were aware of the plot but let it happen because it benefited them in some way. They kept the plane secret for fear that the high-profile assassination of the House Majority Leader would be blamed on them.

6. There was a bomb on the plane. The CIA was unaware of the plot and kept the plane secret for fear that the high-profile assassination of the House Majority Leader would be blamed on them.

7. There was **not** a bomb on the plane. The CIA found the plane and kept it secret for an unknown reason.

So it boils down to whether there was a bomb on the plane, how involved the mob/CIA was in the bomb plot, and the CIA's motivation for keeping the plane wreckage a secret. Again, I am listing all possibilities for completeness but I think #6 and #7 are by far the most likely. It's possible the CIA actually conspired to bomb the plane but that's a pretty serious accusation. And let's be clear, this is all under the huge umbrella assumption that the CIA found the plane in the first place, which I fully admit is a dubious and unsupported claim.

If the CIA did find the plane, though, I don't think they had any idea it was going to go missing. For evidence of this, look at the [GIF](https://i.ibb.co/x5NCtk9/KH-9-Oct-17-20-1972.gif) I linked to above. You can see that they didn't photograph the Prince William Sound part of the search area between Anchorage and Cordova. That makes me think that they missed the opportunity to photograph that area, since the 16th and 17th would have been the only chance, due to the satellite's orbit. If they had been privy to the bombing ahead of time, surely they would have photographed that area as well.

-----

### Watergate and public perception of the CIA

To recap, I think the most likely of the seven possibilities above is that the mob bombed the plane and that the CIA was able to find it afterwards using high-tech equipment. But that equipment was all highly classified at the time. Even the implication that SOSUS existed would have been a threat to national security. They could have tipped off the rest of the search organizers anonymously but then they wouldn't get any credit for the find. In fact, they would get the opposite since evidence of a bomb on the plane could make it look like the CIA played a part in the demise of the House Majority Leader. In 1972, the CIA was already cast in a bad light because of their role in the Watergate scandal, just four months before the plane went missing. From the [CIA Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency):

&gt; Hastening the CIA's fall from grace was the burglary of the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic Party by former CIA officers, and President Richard Nixon's subsequent attempt to use the CIA to impede the FBI's investigation of the burglary. 

The botched 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion was also lingering and the 70s were generally peak CIA underwater craziness. Case in point, [Operation Ivy Bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ivy_Bells) in 1971 and [Project Azorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Azorian) in 1974. I even checked to make sure they wouldn't have used this occasion as a test run for Project Azorian but the Glomar Explorer didn't leave the East Coast until 1973 (page 22 of [this document](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328278722_Glomar_Explorer_and_Project_Azorian)). No matter though, I'm pretty sure they only would have needed a discrete [tugboat with a crane](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-dania-plane-crash-folo-20160904-story.html) to retrieve a Cessna 310 from the Alaskan waters. The area near Malaspina Glacier (and almost everywhere along the flight path) is very remote and they could have recovered the wreckage without scrutiny. It would have been an absolute cake walk and good salvage practice for the CIA, even without the Glomar Explorer.

-----

### Problems with this theory:

1. First and foremost, the much simpler explanation is that the plane crashed in a hard-to-find place. I realize that but I think I've shown that my CIA theory is at least mildly plausible.

2. I wasn't even alive in the 70s so I won't pretend to know whether the CIA would have been properly motivated to cover up a House Majority Leader plane crash in the way I'm suggesting. I think it's plausible but someone more knowledgable could weigh in on that. I just know they did some crazy stuff back then.

3. The California tipster gave the location of the crash AND the number of survivors. I wouldn't think SOSUS could detect whether there were survivors, much less the *number* of survivors. Maybe there was a hydrophone very close that was able to sense footsteps. Maybe they detected the initial crash with SOSUS and zeroed in with the SR-71 spy plane. Maybe the tipster embellished to give his claim a sense of urgency. Maybe he just misspoke. I don't have the original document so it's hard to look into it any further.

4. There is evidence to suggest that the plane didn't make it out of Prince William Sound, which is only about 100 miles from where it took off in Anchorage, Alaska. The strongest support of this is that there was no radio call later when there should have been if the plane was still flying. There's a few plausible reasons why there wasn't a radio call though and it's really anyone's guess as to exactly how far the plane got. For a detailed breakdown of where the plane might have gone down, see the Missing in Alaska podcast, Tail End episode, 4:37 timestamp.

-----

### Conclusions:

* I believe it is possible that the Cessna 310 that went missing in 1972 with the House Majority Leader on board might have been located by underwater hydrophone sensors that were highly classified at the time.

* If the cause of crash was a bomb, I believe the CIA might have been motivated to recover the sunken wreckage without alerting the public or the rest of the searchers.

* This would fit the reputation of the CIA at the time and it would explain why nothing was ever found.

* It could even explain the discrepancies in the NTSB Aircraft Accident Report, which didn't list the plane as having any ice equipment, as well as the lack of news coverage of the event. The CIA may have tampered with the investigation and suppressed the story.

* I'm speculating here but I think a bomb timer would have been set to go off half way through the flight time, which is approximately where Malaspina Glacier lies along the flight path.

* It's possible that the unconfirmed tail/empennage that was recovered near Hinchinbrook Island in the 80s drifted in the ocean currents into Prince William Sound over the years before being found: [Alaskan ocean current map](https://earth.nullschool.net/#2018/10/19/0400Z/ocean/surface/currents/orthographic=-146.84,58.32,2767/loc=-22.721,16.103).

* This theory unifies the two unlikely events that the plane went missing in the first place and that it was never found. If this theory is correct, a bomb caused the crash and that same bomb is also the reason that the recovered wreckage was never disclosed to the public.

* Here's my [previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/hvwrz5/help_find_a_photo_of_a_plane_that_went_missing_in/) on this topic, if anyone is interested.

### Point of clarification

Before anyone comments that Alaska is huge and remote and this plane could have easily gotten lost forever, I understand where you're coming from and I would intuitively agree. The whole point of this theory though is that it operates on the assumption that the plane should have been found. That way, this theory has already been discussed if new evidence suggests that the plane was in fact located. I don't even particularly believe this theory, that's why I'm calling it a theory and highly speculative at that.

That said, I do think there is substantial reason to believe that the plane should have been found. I'm no expert, I'm just going off of the information in the podcast and the very unambiguous statement by search officials that they had a greater than 95% chance of finding the plane. I don't feel that anecdotal evidence is very relevant. There are plenty of planes that have never been found but those were different circumstances at different times in different places. The only real insight we have as to the chances of finding the plane are the ones given by the search organizers because those people were evaluating the likelihood of finding this particular plane and they had a complete picture of the situation that we just don't have 48 years later.

Short of a new investigation with expert testimony and actual statistical analysis, I'm inclined to believe the quote that I used at the beginning of this post, which claims a 95% or greater chance of finding the plane. The closest thing to a modern analysis of the plane's chances of being found is the Missing in Alaska podcast and the host seems to agree that someone should have found something in nearly 50 years, especially considering the importance of this plane's passengers.

Also, the article I linked to at the beginning is a respectable flying magazine that appears to have worked with the podcast host and they are at least open to the idea that the plane didn't crash due to weather/pilot/mechanical error. The more mundane reasons could very well be the case and I even think it's most likely, I'm just saying it doesn't mean we shouldn't consider more exotic possibilities.",conspiracy

Over 1,000 deaths and many, many more severe injuries associated with covid vaccines in just two months; media has no problem.","[.](https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/news/india/images/2018/8/3/dead-crime-death-suicide.jpg)

Measles was touted as a national crisis in 2019. The outbreaks of measles made headlines daily.  Measles this and measles that. How many people died of measles in the U.S. during this media-proclaimed crisis?  **Zero**.  Zero people died and yet the media was losing its fucking mind over a total of 1,282 cases of measles across the entire country.  

**In the last two months, how many people have died just hours or days after injection with covid vaccines?**

I think the number of deaths associated with the covid vaccines in just two months has already surpassed the number of measles infections the media was losing its mind over for the entire year of 2019.  

TL;DR

2019:

1,282 measles **infections** and no deaths: media loses their shit.

2021:

Over 1,000 deaths and far more severe injuries associated with experimental covid vaccines in just two months, media ignores it and continues advocating for everyone to run out and get it.",conspiracy

782,The coming economic collapse and the new Monetary system!,"Most people are aware that we are printing money out at an alarming rate! The United States was already trillions in debt before this pandemic so don‚Äôt let them tell you the pandemic was the cause. Because it wasn‚Äôt! This is happening all over the western world one look at a debt clock for every country will tell you the same thing! The world is in debt! 

Iet me start off by telling you that minimum wage is a joke. The point of minimum wage was to pay a wage that someone could live off. 

Why does minimum wage no longer work? Because of inflation ‚Äúinflation is where currency is devalued‚Äù aka it‚Äôs worth less than before. As the value of money drops and minimum wage stagnates it no longer protects you!

What about the 15 dollar minimum wage Bill the democrats are trying to get passed! This is extremely dishonest way of them pretending they actually care!  You see the real issue is inflation has caused the price of things to skyrocket! Our dollars value has been getting so low that if we adjusted for inflation on minimum wage today it would be $30 dollars an hour! Side note congress adjusts its pay according to inflation!

More information on inflation normally when you inflate the money by printing more money that will mean their is more money roaming around in the economy ! However that is no longer the case ‚Äúlook into the Panama papers‚Äù I suggest you watch the documentary! There are trillions of dollars being wealth hoarded in offshore shell corporations and bank accounts! So in reality the dollar is devalued for nothing! Their isn‚Äôt anymore money out in the wild stimulating the economy! It‚Äôs being held to retain its value within the country! 

You are probably wondering what I mean? Well think of it this way. if I print a bunch of money and than allow it to filter it‚Äôs way back to me and I have a system of people who hoard it, I can take all the money out of the economy that was printed. 

Yeah so? Meaning among the population the dollar will have the same value just the cost of everything goes up aka you don‚Äôt see more money within the system! That‚Äôs why they can still pay people 15 dollars when they should be getting paid 30! The dems and republicans are laughing because they printed out half the money we had Circulating in our economy already this year! Meaning the devalued your $15 in half so they are basically fighting to make minimum wage $7.50.

This system is illegal and is probably the most unethical evil thing done to people! But I fear the system is set to collapse! That is what was intended!

If the system was to self correct you would get hyper inflation ‚Äú they don‚Äôt want this‚Äù basically the money becomes worthless and takes a bunch just to buy a loaf of bread! Look up Zimbabwe money! If this happens that means everyone pays off their debt extremely easy! However it requires stupid amounts of money to buy anything aka 5 million dollars for a candy bar! Yeah! The cost or work, homes, cars etc everything goes up! Meaning a normal salary wouldn‚Äôt be 30,000 after this shit it! 

They don‚Äôt want that to happen debt is what makes you a slave, taxes make sure you can‚Äôt hold wealth and that you need to keep working just to stay afloat!

The main point in this! They want to hold onto your debt while the flip the board over and start a new game! And they are going to make you an offer! They are going to settle your debt and make you sign over your rights to own anything! You will have to rent everything! Look up world economic forum ‚Äúbuild back better‚Äù

This new system you will get is called universal basic income! They will give you money, you can not hold onto money or create any wealth or saving! They want total control over their slaves! In this new system they will adjust value on things! The people who don‚Äôt take the deal will be forced to pay back their debt on money that is now worth a lot more! They think this is fair and just! 

You can bet your ass they will issue new laws and policy based on class warfare! The wealthy who stole and cheated and hoarded their wealth will get to keep what they stole and hoarded! It will only keep getting worse with generations! I think the first generation will get treated fairly nice however after 2 more generation they will drive the point home your a slave!
They will take meat away, make people eat ground up bugs ‚Äúprotein‚Äù, homes will be basically pods you sleep in. Everything will cost money that you can never own including your carbon footprint which will be the end of the year tax and will adjust to your UBI the next year! Meaning your still in debt slavery!

That‚Äôs if you take the deal! If everyone is wise to the game! They don‚Äôt win! The game resets itself and the wealth they stole and devalued means nothing! Once the monetary system collapses we have one chance to take everyone of them out of office in every country! Start over with a new system for ourselves!",conspiracy

833,"States that are mandatorily enforced to wear, ""Suffocation Devices,"" aka, ""Masks,"" VS. States that are not mandated to wear, ""Masks.""","This was brought to my attention a few weeks back when I was on Facebook and looking through peoples stories. One person's story that I was looking at, was from a girl I once went to Middle School with in Washington State; she currently resides in Arlington, Texas. 

Her story featured her and her sister at a local bar, tons of people at the venue, and everyone has a drink in their hand, dancing, &amp; having a good time. What struck me, was that no one, NO ONE, not even the bartenders, were wearing masks. I thought to myself, ""god that must be nice! I'd love to go back to a year ago when I wasn't forced to wear a suffocation device."" 

I currently reside in Washington State, and as many are NOT aware of, Washington State's Governor, Governor Jay Inslee (he's a pos weasle of a human being) issued a statewide mandate enforcing everyone to wear masks...everywhere. It's even gone as far as including businesses, government agencies, government buildings, restaurants, gas stations etc. to enforce any and all customers/potential customers to HAVE to be wearing a mask to even be able to enter their establishment. Just about every business in my local &amp; surrounding area(s) have a sign hanging in their window/on their door that states, ""NO MASK, NO SERVICE."" I think it's funny that I no longer see signs that state, ""NO SHOES, NO SHIRT, NO SERVICE,"" but only now see the signs about masks. That leads me to believe that even if one isn't wearing shoes &amp;/or a shirt, as long as they're wearing a mask, they'll be able to have service(s) provided to them and lol 

In tandem with that, I've also noticed a recent up kick in rising, ""COVID-19,"" numbers/death toll, particularly in Pierce County where I reside. I started conducting research on statistics/COVID numbers for States that are mandated to wear masks vs. States that aren't enforcing it's governed to wear masks...and that's when I experienced the damnedest realization: States like WA where I live, have much HIGHER COVID numbers than that of their Southern counterparts, such as: Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, Oklahoma, etc. 

Very ironic that States where they aren't making people wear masks, and it appears that most people aren't, have significantly LOWER COVID outbreaks/numbers than somewhere where its' people are involuntarily forced to wear them. 

So, what does that tell me? It tells me that the CDC is lying to everyone, and that masks did not/do not work LOL

Just for clarification purposes, I was/I am aware that masks, COVID-19, CDC are all a bunch of bullshit.

One last thing to add, and something that's very, VERY creepy - if you go to the Google search bar and type in ""Your City, Your State COVID 33,"" you'll see a TON of news articles for your area that are linked to 33 somehow.

I‚Äôll leave that up to the viewer (though I personally understand it to be a real thing). But what I‚Äôm talking about is the blatant ignorance that makes the news/mainstream sources of information these days. There is a lot of criticism against American for its high case rate. Yes the numbers are high, but when you start comparing it to other countries (‚ÄúAmerica ranks #1 in etc etc) then its ridiculous. How can you rank numbers when countries like Bangladesh only report ‚Äú5000‚Äù cases, a place where people literally live on top of each other? Or China, which is still in the 80,000s? It‚Äôs ridiculous, and any other objective ranking would‚Äôve thrown out the entire dataset when huge disparities like that are noticed. 

Yet these are the numbers paraded around. And it‚Äôs very interesting that the west has higher numbers, when the very place that the virus is known to have originated from remains low. And if you are to assume that those numbers are somehow authentic (like what the newsmakers seem to be portraying), then it‚Äôs still very weird that the traditional advanced countries have the highest numbers.

863,Conspirituality: The Truth of the Inner Reality &amp; the Outer World Are One,"Recently there has been concern by those who love to find things to be concerned about that the realms of spirituality and conspiracy are merging. These people see this as a dangerous trend and a threat to our society.

These people think this way because they understand neither spirituality nor the truth of (some) conspiracies. 

Spirituality and conspiracy theories tend to go together because they are both concerned with finding the truth. 

Spiritual truth is the inner reality of the individual.

Conspiratorial truth seeks to know the outer reality of the society.

For the human being, finding themselves within a strange and mad world while not knowing who they truly are - they are called to walk both of these avenues of truth.

# To Be Truly Awake, You Must Know Oneself AND The Matrix

Spiritual awakening requires understanding the truth of your Self and your world. 

You must know your inner consciousness and also the reality you live within.

If you are not awake to the truth of the world you live in, then you are not truly awake.

And if you are not awake to the truth of your very own self, then you are not awake either.

In the movie The Matrix, Neo took the red pill and woke up to the truth of the world he lived within. But this was just the first step of understanding. 

He was not fully awakened and enlightened as ‚ÄúThe One‚Äù until he had the inner transformation and came to know who he truly was and that he was the creator of his reality. 

Coming to realize the truth of one‚Äôs predicament in this Matrix of the human world on Earth is just the beginning - walking the spiritual path to discover empowerment, liberation, and the truth of life is the real goal. 

# Inner &amp; Outer Truth

When you follow an authentic spiritual path, you learn to question all of what you have believed to be true about yourself.

* You clean up your physical body from ingesting toxins and from engaging in unhealthy habits. 
* You observe your actions, thoughts, emotions, and beliefs to see if they are aligned with truth and what you prefer to be. 
* You undergo a process of unlearning and removing from yourself all the conditioned beliefs about yourself implanted in you from the world around you. 
* You liberate yourself from abusive relationships and relationships founded upon lies, coercion, secrets, etc.
* You leave behind external religion and create/discover true spirituality.

The process of waking up to the truth of the world and therefore transcending it is also the same practice, just applied to the world you exist within.

* You observe the actions, words, and intent behind the structures of power and influence in our world and examine what their true agendas are and the fruits of their efforts.
* You unlearn what you have been taught in school, from the media, from the scientific establishment, from the politicians and realize that not only is what they are saying fundamentally untrue - but the entire system is founded upon lies, a belief in the legitimacy of authority, etc.
* You free yourself from the abusive relationship with your government and other external control systems in your life. You learn to be responsible and sovereign without external dependency.
* You realize that money is a religion, government is a religion, modern science is a religion - all belief systems that, when investigated, are illegitimate and keep humanity enslaved.

The two go hand in hand - inner awakening and outer awakening. Inner sovereignty and outer sovereignty.

The more you do your inner work, the more the external world will become transparent, and you will easily see every person and every system that is out of alignment with Truth. 

# Going Down The Rabbit Hole

When you go truly deep within yourself and this reality, you begin to encounter how truly, ‚Äútruth is stranger than fiction.‚Äù

As you investigate the nature of humanity, our origins, and our current state - you come upon evidence and accounts that point to truths about humanity that would put 90% of people in the hospital in a state of shock and disbelief.

Like people in the Matrix movie, most people don‚Äôt want to know the truth, and if they were forced into seeing it, they would deny it, attack the one attempting to show them, and possibly go insane. 

Like Plato‚Äôs dwellers in the cave - any reality outside of the shadows upon the wall is laughed off and dismissed as a ‚Äúcrazy conspiracy theory.‚Äù

For the one who unshackles themself and walks out of the cave and into the light of day, the true nature of reality is both a spiritual truth and a grand conspiracy.

# All Truths Lead to One Truth

At the deepest level, spirituality and conspiracy combine.  If you investigate either one deeply, you will encounter the other. In investigating the truth of oneself, one naturally comes to see the truth of the world - for the world is a mirror of yourself. 

All the same themes are being played out in the world as in your consciousness. Human beings are struggling with the same things the individual is learning to evolve beyond.  For the collective is a fractal of the individual.

The one with an integrated spiritual insight understands that the human experience is one grand conspiracy on many levels.

They will realize that the world they thought they lived in is the creation of their own consciousness, is a multi-dimensional mirror of themselves. They will see that it is an illusion, a dream, and nothing within it can enslave them other than their belief in limitation and lack. 

They will understand that human beings are conspiring together to create a certain reality-experience here on Earth. For thousands of years, that experience has entailed a group of negatively polarized beings playing the role of rulers and manipulators of mankind.  However, this has been all part of the game, the play, the theatre and served the purpose of learning and exploration. 

That game is coming to a close, and much is being revealed. Hence the rising trend of conspiracies and spirituality merging together and appearing in the mainstream consciousness. 

Conspiracies and spirituality are going mainstream because we are reaching the end of the Grand Illusion - Humanity‚Äôs prolonged state of ignorance, hypnosis, and sleep.

We are in the time of The Revealing and The Great Shift, where humanity en masse awakens to long forgotten and suppressed truths and makes a quantum leap in evolution. 

Not all spirituality is authentic. Not all conspiracies are true. 

But it is the nature of our earth experience and the greater reality that everything is both a spiritual experience and a conspiratorial unfolding. These two elements are coming together now in the year 2021 as a central theme in the Story of the New Earth.

[Here goes my diary entry of 23/12/2020]
So, I'm currently in a rental house in India and its 3:48 AM rn. And it is rumored that something known as ""‡§¨‡§ø‡§®‡§æ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞ ‡§µ‡§≤‡•á ‡§ò‡•ã‡§∞‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§ï/‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ï"" which translates to The protector or the owner of the headless horse used to appear once in a year and whoever watches it cleaning its horse, dies with a high fever within no time. I was creeped out while listening to the rumors from my roommate, but in the end I laughed it off and said that nothing to worry bout it cause they're just rumors. He said that they aren't just rumors cause there was really a guys whose beloved horse's head was cut of as he didn't pay enough tax. I was totally creeped out upon listening to the rumors and stories. Feeling sleepy GTG, GN üåë

[Diary entry of the next day]
What I'm saying is that it is a usual trait for Indian Legends to show themselves whenever someone doesn't believe that they did exist, for example we can take the story of Lokenath who was able to see Kaali mata(a goddess) an fun fact, Lokenath was the biggest atheist at that time and within no time he started praying Kaali mata which was a big shock for his family.

879,"Use of ""spam"" text messages in social engineering.","

Here me out.  Give me a fair shake.  I want an honest, but objective, opinion.

I've been receiving lots of spam text messages lately.  Up until this point in my life, I've never really received spam via text message. Some here and there... Once or two random text messages every few months...but for the last few weeks I've been receiving four or five of them a day.  I try to block the numbers, but they keep coming up.

Since this ordeal started I've just assumed the links had malware or trojans in them.  I don't like them, but I'm not concerned enough to immediately do anything about the situation.  One thing I do notice, however, is that in the back of my mind, I feel like I'm being watched everytime I receive one of these things.  It's very subtle, but the feeling is definitely there.  I also notice that I think twice about what I post online when I've recently received one.


**My question:. Do you think that governments use ""spam"" text messaging systems to influence what people talk about and how people act?**

Like, no viruses or malware, the effects are meant to be purely psychological. Using A.I. and raw facebook data, mixed with camera and microphone data, the process could be automated, targeted, and completely deniable.  It's pretty obvious they can do it, but do they do it.

ORIGINAL POST:

First time poster here.

I don't know if this is a bit off topic maybe but I find it fascinating so I decided to share.

I like reading people's body language and the smile is a big one for me.

The most fun, life loving and positive people have a certain, characteristic smile.

It is all about the eyes. When these people are smiling, their bottom eyelids are making a little arch.

After many years of observation, I can confirm that these are great, pure and just life loving people.

A great celebrity example of that smile would be Emilia Clarke. I don't know her, but I'm sure she's a great person, just judging from her smile.

On the other hand we have, for example, David Miscavige, who is trying very hard, and yet he cannnot mask his dead eye smile.

The same goes with Hillary Clinton and her daughter and Nancy Pelosi (first persons off the top of my head).

You can see that clearly when you cover their smiles with your hand and notice, that the eyes don't match the smile at all. They are unable to fake a sincere smile, no matter how hard they try.

Are they evil? I don't know them. Maybe, maybe not. Fun exercise nevertheless.

I was watching one person's youtube channel because most of what they say is accurate.   But recently I've been getting a bullshit vibe from them.  Because I know how to use my psychic abilities I can usually tell when people are lying or at least repeating information that is bullshit.  And that is the vibe I got from this person.  And this person claims to be psychic and they can't sense that their information is bullshit even though I sense it clear as day.  I don't think so.

So youtube is crawling with shills.  And the one I'm talking about is clearly an outer gate keeper because his knowledge is pretty advanced.  Also he exposed three other shills.  Most likely to prop himself up so he could say I exposed other shills so I""m not a shill.  These people are very very clever  One of them I watched their videos for a decade before he turned and started promoting trump.  And he is another person who should know better.

So the level of bullshit is insane.  The lengths the elite go to try to bullshit people is totally insane.  They must have a government agency that manages these shills.  The department of shill.

People/politicians are hypocrites. Being a hypocrite and flip flopper isn't a conspiracy. It's low effort posting and rarely brings anything to the forefront of conspiring.

939,Do you think a public person in the US would have a chance to speak like this? Here is an interesting opinion of a famous Russian director who is also well-known in Europe.," ""Ethical Reich of the West"": stage director Bogomolov wrote a manifesto

**‚ÄúModern Russia is certainly far from the Europe it was striving for. But the country obviously does not want to go to a new European freak show‚Äù, - Konstantin Bogomolov is convinced.**

**‚ÄúDue to the coincidence of circumstances, we found ourselves in the tail of a crazy train, rushing into Bosch's hell, where we will be greeted by multicultural gender-neutral devils. You just need to unhook this carriage, cross yourself and start building your own world‚Äù, - the stage director said. This is an excerpt from a manifesto entitled ""The Abduction of Europa 2.0"", which Bogomolov wrote and, calling for public discussion, published in** **Novaya Gazeta****. The material contains his reflections on events in Europe, Western values, Russia and the new ethical Reich. We publish it in fragments.**

""... In the XX century, atomic energy, which is a man, went out of control. Nazism became human Chernobyl. The shock and fear of Europe before this explosion of primitive in man turned out to be too great.

Having freed itself from Nazism, the West decided to insure itself against a ""nuclear accident"" by eliminating a complex person.

That complex person whom Europe has formed over the long years of Christianity. The person that Dostoevsky described: both high and low, an angel and a devil, loving and hating, believing and doubting, reflective and fanatical.

Europe was frightened by the beast in man, not realizing that the beast is the same natural and organic part of man as the angelic. Unable to overcome the consequences of Nazism intellectually and spiritually, Europe decided to castrate a difficult person. Castrate his dark nature, immure his demons forever.

At one time, Kubrick shot ""A Clockwork Orange"" - a picture of brutalized young guys who, under the influence of drugs, terrorize London, brutally beating and raping peaceful inhabitants. When the leader of the gang is caught, he is offered to undergo experimental therapy for early release: fixing his eyelids so that they do not close, he is shown scenes of violence for hours to the music of his beloved Beethoven. As a result, the young man does not just get rid of aggression - he is sick of music, he cannot see a naked woman, sex makes him disgusted. And in response to the blow, he licks the boot of the striker.

The modern West is such a criminal who has undergone chemical castration and lobotomy. Hence this false smile of goodwill and all-acceptance, frozen on the face of a Western person. This is not the smile of Culture. It is a smile of degeneration.

**New Ethical Reich**

The West declares itself as a society ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for the realization of personal freedoms. In fact, today the West is fighting a person as a complex and difficult to control energy. In this struggle, the functions of the court, prosecution and isolation are not eliminated, but delegated from the state to society. The state, represented by the police and security officials, was ‚Äúhumanized‚Äù and ‚Äúhumanized‚Äù, but the conventionally progressive society took on the role of new storm troopers, with the help of which the same state is super effective in combating dissent.

The modern Western world is taking shape in the New Ethical Reich with its own ideology - ‚Äúnew ethics‚Äù. National Socialism in the Past. This is ethical socialism. Queer socialism. Siemens, Boss and Volkswagen turned into Google, Apple and Facebook, and the ‚ÄúNazis‚Äù were replaced by a mix of queer activists, fem-fanatics and ecopsychopaths, just as aggressive and just as thirsty for a total reformatting of the world.

Traditional totalitarian regimes suppressed freedom of thought. The new non-traditional totalitarianism has gone further and wants to control emotions. Restricting the freedom of an individual's emotion is a revolutionary concept in the New Ethical Reich.

Feelings and thoughts have always been a private area of a person. He had no right to let go of his hands, but his heart and brain were free. This was the unspoken social contract of European civilization, which understood man as a vessel of emotions and ideas, where hatred is another side of love - albeit a difficult and dangerous, but a necessary and important part of the human personality.

In Nazi society, a person began to train like a dog to hate others.

In the New Ethical Reich, a person is trained to love and deprived of the right to freely hate.

You can no longer say ""I do not like ..."", ""I do not like ..."", ""I am afraid ..."". You have to correlate your emotions with public opinion and social values.

And social values have become the new Wailing Wall, where every unhappy, offended, or simply dishonest individual can not only bring a note, but also demand from the new God - the Progressive Society - to add his resentment, drama, fear or illness to the list of the new ethical UNESCO, giving it socially significant status, the allocation of a budget for it and the creation of a special quota in all spheres of public life. And anyone who says that offense is not worth a damn, the disease is curable, and personal drama is an intimate question, will become a victim of a powerful repressive machine - that very public opinion.

**Sexual counter-revolution**

The new Reich declared war on death. War to human nature, in which wilting and death are part of an incomprehensible divine plan. The pursuit of eternal youth has become an internal idefix of the new Western society.

And the reason is obvious: death is unpredictable and divine. And queer socialists, like the national socialists, like the communists, do not recognize any other power over themselves than the power of their Idea. Idea and Razio are their God. Or they are Gods themselves and consider man not as a secret, but as an object of experiment, meat. The war against death is a war against the mystery of being. A senseless and stupid war against eternity.

But where there is a war against death as a divine given, as a mystical outcome, a war against life is inevitable. For life is as unpredictable as death. Just as incomprehensible. This means that it is uncontrollable and dangerous.

Europe quickly went from the sexual revolution, which became the new European post-Nazi renaissance, to an all-out struggle with the energy of sex - the most vital, emotional and uncontrollable part of human existence.

For sex is freedom. Sex is a danger. Sex is an animal in man. But most importantly, sex is the birth of Life.

Christianity gave sacredness to the sexual act. Divinity and beauty. Erotica was a piece of art. Desire is a manifestation of inspiration. Sex is the sacred pleasure of Love. Birth is a miracle.

The new Reich considers sex to be a production and the genitals as a tool. And in accordance with the precepts of the socialists of the past and within the framework of the new queer socialism, it socializes the instruments of production and redistributes them, while the production itself optimizes and puts under state social control, making gender irrelevant.

The burnt-out Notre Dame in Paris is not a sign of the fall of Christian Europe under the pressure of Muslim. But a strange and mystical sign of the war of the New Reich with the sacred secret of life and death, revealed in the Cross.

**Borders and a new race theory**

The transboundary nature of society, globalization is part of the creation of a new totalitarian empire. In the old days, a dissident had the opportunity to leave his society and find a new one.

Borders insured the freedom of the individual: the diversity of ethical and value systems created an opportunity for a person to find his own - or one that would accept him as much as possible, or simply not interfere with life - an environment of habitation and realization.

The new ethical empire longs for expansion and unification of societies. Thus, a new global village is created, where the dissenting person cannot hide from the guardians of ethical purity.

Ethical purity has replaced racial purity. And today in the West it is not the shape of the nose and national identity that is examined under the microscope, but the ethical past of every successful individual: is there, in the depths of decades, some at least small but harassment, abuse, or just a statement that does not correspond to the new value system. And if there is, fall on your knees and repent.

**The Europe They Lost**

The revolution isolated Russia from the West for almost a century. Freed from Bolshevism, Russia in the 90s of the last century rushed to Europe. Russia sought acceptance, tried to study, dreamed of regaining the status of a European country. And to regain European values. The values of beautiful pre-war Europe. Europe, which was not afraid of a complex person in all its diversity. Respected his freedom to love and hate.

Europe, which understood that nature created man precisely as a complex, contradictory and dramatic creature, and did not consider herself entitled to interfere with a higher plan. Europe, for which the main value of a person was his individuality, expressed not in how a person has sex, but in how he thinks and creates. And the creativity itself consisted in the creation of pictures, music, texts, and not in reshaping one's own body and inventing new gender definitions.

Russia was looking for such a Europe through the 90s. She herself dreamed of becoming.

Is it necessary today to try to find allies where they do not exist?

Europe - an abandoned and plundered cherry orchard. The Firs are hiding from the crowds of migrants, the Ranevskys are sniffing cocaine for the remains of their health, Petya Trofimov writes Euro-laws, Anya realized that she is a queer person, and the surviving Gayevs, who are old man Biden, mumble their usual words about kindness and justice.

Modern Russia is certainly far from the Europe it was striving for. But she obviously does not want to go to the new European freak show.

Our progressives and Westernizers insist: Russia was and is a country of guards and slaves. This is largely true. But it is also true that long years of life in conditions of lack of freedom, the camp fear, snitching, and also silence and violence as ways of survival and ways of protecting the people from power and power from the people - all this requires not revolutions, but patience and therapy. Lancelot's drama is that he didn't really love either Elsa or those he was trying to save.

I detest the spirit of violence and the atmosphere of fear. But this does not mean that I will accept the transformation of the country of guards and slaves into a country where they knock not from fear, but from the heart, they are poisoned not from denseness, but from enlightenment, where multi-colored (including white) Shvonders from BLM enter houses and require professorship sit on one knee, share living space and donate money to help the starving Floyds.

Russia went through all this in the 17th. Feminitives, and other abuse of language, and an attempt to free oneself from gender or cultural identity, and meetings with discussions of moral character, and the massive demands of workers, and even children betraying their parents - this happened recently in the United States, when a democratic girl gave up their parents, the Trump police, after learning that they participated in the protests and the storming of the Capitol. It was all there. And how amazing it is to see the Western world, as if Vera Pavlovna is dreaming for the first time with sweet dreams, and how strange it is to observe the burning eyes and naive speeches of the new Russian commoners, who are conducting moral terror against dissenting people no worse than street riot police.

And there are many who disagree, and these are not at all ""dense"" orthodox. They are modern, cheerful and free people, educated and successful, open to new things, loving life in all its diversity. Russians, Europeans, Americans, secretly dreaming that these strange and dark times will pass. They are afraid to vote. They are afraid to become targets of network bullying in Russia. To be subjected to moral terror, to lose jobs and funding in the West.

They need support like air. It is necessary that their feelings and thoughts were formalized into a word, and the word was supported by will and organization. This means that it is time to clearly and distinctly formulate a new right-wing ideology, an ideology beyond radical orthodoxy, but strictly and irreconcilably defending the values of a complex world based on a complex person.

Russian raznochintsy tell us: Russia is at the tail of progress.

Not.

Thanks to a coincidence, we found ourselves in the tail of a crazy train, rushing into Bosch's hell, where we will be greeted by multicultural, gender-neutral devils.

I was assigned mobile counselors that helped me work through it. They would take me places, coffee, art stuff. There was the lady counsoler, I'll refer to her as G. Very awesome people. This story is about one of them in particular, I'm gonna just call him B.

B was an ex secret service agent for the Clinton Administration. He was very close, enough to tell us that Hillary Clinton treated Bill Clinton like shit. He was also an ex police officer. He is one of the nicest guys I've ever met.

I recall they used to joke about getting a license plate with ""Q"" on it, saying it was a joke because of the way G would say, thank you funny. She would say it like ""than-quuu!"" One day before our time together was up, they pulled up to my house with a decorative license plate on the front of G's car. Just one big fancy letter ""Q."" 

Ok... This may be totally totally coincidental. This was back in 2011. But... B was an ex secret service agent after all. Also I may add, Q-anon started off I think as something true, but I believe it got highjacked by some people along the way. But.. dang.

1,My mom is harassing my 92 year old grandmother,"Hey folks, first time posting on here. Little background information, I live in New York state with my wife and kids. My parents live in Wisconsin, which is where I grew up. We try to FaceTime with them every night so that they can read a story to our kids. A couple months ago we noticed my parents seemed different. They didn't seem excited to talk to the kids, they just seemed sorta blah. Then, finally, back in January, the floodgates opened. One day my mom started sending me all kinds of links and pictures from ""research"" she had done online. I didn't realize it at the time but everything she was sending me was Q related. At first I was polite and just tried to brush it off, telling her I did not want to discuss politics or hear about any of this stuff she was saying. Eventually she started getting more confrontational, telling me that I was oppressing her and her beliefs. She began insulting me, telling me that I can't really backup my beliefs and that I was blinded and close-minded. Finally, I exploded into an anti-Trump diatribe. She shot her fake research and delusions back at me, I told her these aren't political beliefs, they are a mass delusion and a cult. She wouldn't stop talking so I hung up on her. I realize I didn't handle it the best way, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I reached out to my aunt who is closest to my mom and found out that my mom hasn't talked to her in weeks over my aunt saying something bad about Trump on social media. Fast forward, my mom has mentioned that she is upset at my grandma for getting the Covid vaccine because she thinks it's going to kill her (another Q delusion.) We called my grandma last night to talk to the kids, and she mentioned that she wanted to speak to me in private. She had tears in her eyes and seemed upset about something. I called my grandma today and found out that my mother has been berating her about everything Q related. My grandmother keeps telling her that she doesn't believe in this and it upsets her to hear about it but my mother won't listen. My grandmother told me that my mom wants to come stay with her for a week, and with her voice shaking, she told me that she doesn't want her to. My grandmother can't take a whole week of my mother trying to brainwash her and tell her all these upsetting things. It was the most heartbreaking phone call I have ever been a part of. My grandma is 92 years old, she has survived Covid, the loss of her husband, multiple bouts with cancer, she is a goddamn survivor who doesn't need or deserve this. At this point, I am just completely at a loss. My grandmother told me she feels like she lost her daughter and I feel like I lost my mother. Reading other people's stories has helped a little but at this point I am afraid we may never get my parents back. Thanks for reading, sorry this went on for so long.",QAnonCasualties
2,Has anyone‚Äôs Q family or friends had any reaction to the news of Trump getting the vaccine?,My (Q) mom isn‚Äôt a Covid denier and was never an anti-masker. She‚Äôs had Covid &amp; is dealing with long-hauler issues that have prevented her from returning to work since. She believes that the virus was intentionally made &amp; spread from the lab in China and doesn‚Äôt trust the vaccines &amp; refuses to get it. I am hoping the fact that Trump was vaccinated might make her more receptive to getting vaccinated. Has anyone seen any possible change in opinion towards the vaccine?,QAnonCasualties
3,BF is reading conspiracies now,"My boyfriend has been politically neutral historically- mostly because he hasn‚Äôt had a desire to pay attention or learn about these things. 

Recently though he‚Äôs started watching a lot of Steven Crowder. And today he started talking to me about a video he watched on YouTube about voter fraud... and some blog he read online about how ballots were delivered to the processing building in the cover of night and that people were registered with fake addresses....

IÔ∏è feel like he‚Äôs creeping into fishy territory. And he can be a little impressionable. He doesn‚Äôt really fact check this info and his base response to things is to lean conservative. He says he doesn‚Äôt believe it all until he learns more about it but idk if IÔ∏è totally believe that. 
I‚Äôm just worried he‚Äôs gonna slide down a slippery slope to Q anon stuff and wacky, hateful conservative conspiracies. 

What can IÔ∏è do? I‚Äôm left leaning and I‚Äôve been sharing podcasts and articles that have been as neutral as IÔ∏è can get so he‚Äôll read them. Like, the podcast Left Right &amp; Center. Just so he can hear the opinions and reasoning of all sides. But he still hasn‚Äôt tried checking all those out.

Tbh this makes me really nervous. Previously IÔ∏è wouldn‚Äôt have really been bothered by differing political beliefs in a partner, back when it was ‚Äúone party wants a bridge built in 3 months, one wants a bridge built in 7 months.‚Äù But now IÔ∏è feel like the parties are separated by moral differences. Which worries me because IÔ∏è can see him getting sucked into more hateful stuff and IÔ∏è don‚Äôt wanna lose him to that kind of propaganda. 

We‚Äôve talked about this a little before. We both try to stay neutral on politics until we have the full picture, which I appreciate. But my natural inclination is to lean left, for him it‚Äôs right IÔ∏è think. If he were to take a sudden nose dive into like homophobia, nationalist, xenophobic territory I‚Äôd call it off immediately- fortunately it‚Äôs not there. 

Any advice on how IÔ∏è can combat this? Do IÔ∏è need to combat this? IÔ∏è don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs gonna believe that Jews with space lasers are gonna rule the world, but he‚Äôs not immune from right wing propaganda - especially because he doesn‚Äôt have a lot of life experience. Has anyone dealt with this kind of tension between an SO?",QAnonCasualties
4,The bridge too far...,"For several months now, this sub-Reddit has helped me process the loss of a partner who became increasingly radicalized into the Q universe. You all understand the confusion, pain, heartbreak, feelings of hopelessness, and tug-of-war between loving someone and watching the person you love erode in front of your eyes. I have despaired, cried, laughed (the humor in some comments has made things more bearable) along with you, and drawn healing from your sharing; so thank you. 

I write today with a question that has often entered my mind as I read our stories of struggle and loss. It‚Äôs the flip-side of the question: Why are people vulnerable to Q narratives? My question, instead, is: What made you immune?

If you‚Äôre like me, you probably tried reading and researching just to understand your loved one. What made you stop short and say: I won‚Äôt go further.?

I know, when discussing Q, there are objective yardsticks for measuring the descent into unreality. But, I‚Äôm more interested in the individual subjective experience of those who resist. I am also an academic and understanding this phenomenon has been one way I have dealt with my personal Q loss.

Trying to understand my partner‚Äôs beliefs certainly lead to crumbs of truth that would not have landed on my plate had I not made an effort to understand my Q partner. But, the crumbs didn‚Äôt amount to enough for me.

I‚Äôm guessing each of us had our moments of disbelief where we had to draw the line, however painful doing that was. I know, for myself, I struggled long with guilt wondering if I was doing the right thing by giving up, trying to understand with each new Q belief why my partner could go there. I‚Äôm wondering if you care to share what that experience of discovering your limit was for you. 

In a more general way, I think my question is about the future of the Q universe (which has already started to divest from the Q label). This sub keeps growing everyday and so do movements around the world that draw energy from Q and Q-adjacent narratives. Wealth, education level, family situation seem to matter little in predicting who is vulnerable. Hence, I think, my interest in understanding the other side of vulnerability. 

What prevents some of us from burrowing into the rabbit holes? What made you stop short?

Thank you, in advance, for your insights.",QAnonCasualties
5,Things are Worse Than I Thought,"Has anyone else's Q gotten more aggressive in the past couple of months? I thought things would be getting better, but they're only getting worse. My mom is convinced that Trump is still president and that a huge ""announcement"" will be made revealing everything. She's been saying these things since the inauguration, but I was hoping that it would all die down the more that NOTHING has happened. 

This morning, my Q loved one screamed at me for deciding to get the vaccine. She claimed that I was not going to be able to have kids and that I would have health issues down the road. She said that I was blind to the enemy and that I've been brainwashed??? Then she said that everything is truth and compared herself to Jesus knowing all of these things. I just want this to be over and she doesn't listen to anyone. My stepdad is just enabling her and there's no one to intervene.

6,One of the founders of QAnon is my stalker.,"I just joined the forum in order to be able to post about this.  The man who has stalked me for the last three years is one of the founders of the QAnon scam.  He, like Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys, is the head of an alt right militia -- and himself involved in human trafficking.  I am blogging about this situation, because I feel it is so fundamentally dangerous to our democracy.  [https://thegodfatherconversations.blogspot.com](https://thegodfatherconversations.blogspot.com) QAnon adherents have blogged about ""the storm,"" in which 100,000 Americans were to have been arrested (on false charges) if Trump had been re-elected.  What they don't realize is that those false charges have been ""anchored"" in falsified police reports in law enforcement offices that have been infiltrated by the alt right.  I don't want to enter a heated political debate with anyone, honestly.  I just want to let you know what I know on the chance that it may help you or someone you love.  If you ask questions here, I will do my best to answer them with the information I currently possess.  I believe that access to the full truth is the only way out of the QAnon scam.  People need to know that they have been manipulated as part of a carefully crafted political ploy of the alt right.  Misinformation and democracy cannot co-exist.  We, as a society, have to choose one or the other.  I hope I can contribute to the preservation of our democracy by revealing what I know.  I'm wishing you all the best.

8,My aunt has progressively gotten worse since Trump's win in 2016 and I fear she is a QAnon believer,"My father's side of the family has always been pretty right-leaning, but it never truly bothered me growing up. I had the privilege of not really caring about politics and considered myself neutral on most issues, but really because I didn't care to do more research. I was a teenager and didn't consider politics to be very important. 

Around late high school, early college I realized my views were definitely more left-leaning. Having different political views from my family didn't bother me at all in the beginning, I figured we'd agree to disagree and move on. Oh no. Despite my family posting conservative Facebook posts frequently (I would never comment on their posts no matter how much I disagreed), the moment I would post anything even implying a left-leaning view, my relatives would always comment and tell me I was wrong.

 One particular Aunt was even worse. She said I was ""seeing the world through rose-colored glasses"" for celebrating the legalization of gay marriage in the United States (this particular comment cut deep because I am a closeted bisexual), she would share articles that I had shared onto my Facebook page, put them on her page and tag me onto the post saying things like ""my niece shared this and I want everyone to see this ridiculous crap"", for people I didn't know to comment and call me an idiot. 

I tried my best to cut ties with that part of the family, but I'll still see my Aunt's posts from time to time (I help out with my mom's Facebook time to time and my mom is still friends with her, so her posts pop up often). My aunt has gotten severely worse.

She frequently posts things about COVID-19 being a hoax, bragging about not wearing a mask, etc. She is also still extremely homophobic and transphobic. She believes the election was a fraud. She bragged about being a conspiracy theorist. Her Facebook account was actually disabled because she would frequently post hateful shit and pure misinformation, but she just created a new account and hasn't stopped posting the same garbage. The last thing she posted was about how the COVID vaccines are dangerous and a hoax. 

She has 3 daughters, the oldest being 14 and starting to share her views.

I feel so very sad that she has doubled down and is on QAnon's side (she hasn't outright said she's apart of it, but all of her posts make me believe so). A part of me wishes I could help her, but I know she would want nothing to do with me and would only continue to antagonize me.",QAnonCasualties
9,Is this real?,"My Qperson (dh) said a few days after Biden was sworn in that he didn't believe all of that anymore. He never talks about it now. I would love to believe him but am cautiously optimistic. 

Before saying this he would argue any counter point I tired to make and even once told me it was what he believed and even said he didn't care if I left him (when I had made no inference to leaving him). The point is he was ALL in. 

The thing is he believed a lot of that stuff LONG before he mentioned any of it to me and it took him several weeks to admit everything he believed (and it was all of it!).

So should I believe that he doesn't believe any of it anymore? Is there anyway to know? Does it matter if he does if he never talks to me about it?",QAnonCasualties

QDad: Biden is a clone. 
Me: how do you know?
QDad: we know because his earlobes are different.
Me: But if he is a clone they would be the SAME.
QDad: Well he could be just a good body double.
Me: why though?
QDad: Biden wouldn't do their bidding so they killed him then cloned him / got a double of him. See?
Me: Totally... But why Biden?
Q Dad: Because they needed someone who would be well spoken and present well to the public.. look presidential. It's making sense now isn't it?
Me: Yeah...just one thing.... Why pick someone who by your own insisting is a demented old bafoon? Not like, Michelle Obama or something. Especially on the heels of that big best selling book. Why not just recruit her... everyone loves her... why murder an old man and replace him with an even more demented old man? Seems over complicated.

12,Colleagues,"I used to be into conspiracies as an adolescent and being able to discuss them as an adult with my coworker X meant that we got along ok. X is a decent person at heart however their views seemed to mimic the views of right wing voices in US politics. Through X I became aware of Q and the more we talked, the more their views became increasingly bizarre, downright annoying and repetitive.

X often mentioned 'pizzagate' and paedophile rings being exclusive to Democratic party candidates

X tried to convince myself that the Capital riots were orchestrated by Antifa members

X tried to convince me that the election was stolen from Trump and he was a faultless person

X repeatedly spoke about Hunter Bidens laptop and 'incriminating evidence'

X would use words such as 'Communist' and 'Socialist' as an insult/to describe people such as AOC and Bernie Sanders. People X deemed spineless and undesirable

X would go as low as mentioning the unattractiveness of Antifa members and how they are misfits of society

X would label groups such as BLM and Antifa as terrorists.

X would tell me that the media lies, unless it supports X's view and that random sources in social media are credible

X would state that being maskless is freedom from being a sheep and vaccinations are high in dangerous metals

Colleague Y who I didnt speak to much placed money on Trump winning the election and has even more bizarre views than X

Friend Z referred to AOC as a demon and when asked why, Z told me that she lies

Im honestly baffled at how easy people fall into the Qanon trap and the worst part about my experience is that WE DONT EVEN LIVE in the United States. They seem more concerned in the cesspool that is US politics as opposed to issues in our own country. No matter how many times I asked for evidence of something, X would show me nothing.

The more I told her, the more the tears rolled down our faces, and I could barely get my words out for laughing.  Weird I know, but very much needed.

15,"QAnon following Dad refusing to believe science, despite my roommate's multiple dead family members","I'll keep it short and bitter, since I mostly need to shout into the void. My idiot father, who I love, has fallen down the Q rabbithole. It was amusing at first, but now he's going around maskless plenty of the time, completely ignoring science expert, policy maker, and 90% of the world's consensus that you shouldn't be traveling or hanging out. 

The other day he texted me, he found out he had had Covid-19 about 3 months ago, explaining the lung issues he thought were his ALREADY PRE-EXISTING LUNG ISSUES (how reckless and stupid can you get??), but never apparently got checked out for.

When I urged him to be extra cautious now that he's already weakened by both Covid-19 damage to the lungs (which he should recover from, his doctor says), and his pre-existing lung issues, he only had this to reply:

""I believe we need to build immunity"".

I'm just furious. My roommate, one of my best and dearest friends, the nicest guy you'd ever meet, who would give you the shirt off his back, the food from his fridge and the last dollar in his wallet, just because you asked, lost his father last year to Covid. We're 24-25, it's too fucking young for him to have to experience that, and he has a brother who's even younger. He just lost another uncle over the weekend.

I'm seething that people like my Dad are throwing caution to the wind and endangering people left and right because of this or that bullshit internet theory that tells them not to trust the experts, that it's all a conspiracy.

The sad fact is, my roommate's Dad did everything right, took every precaution, and he died because of people like my Dad, who will continue to brazenly put others at risk.

I'm sure I'm saying this out of anger and frustration, and may regret it in the future, but honest to God in this moment I wish it was my Dad that died instead of my roommate's. At least he would have had it coming, he deserved it, based on his insistence on being stupid and ignoring expert warnings.

21,Qanon Lite can still complicate life,"So, I have known for many months that I have Q family. At first, I thought they were only being mildly influenced. I thought that since they weren't forcing everyone to believe them, or get away from them, and because they don't scream, accuse, or plot that they were just getting tidbits through their church and Facebook connections. 

A few nights ago, I heard and saw a lot more of their world, and it's a mixed bag because on one hand, I'm really grateful that they aren't frothy and full of ultimatums. On the other hand, it's disappointing and overwhelming to see how surrounded I am by Q influence, and how it compromises their ability to be rational. 

I was shocked to hear a relative go on about how Trump is still secretly in charge, Biden is a doppelganger, and it's all part of a ""larger plan,"" they have faith in. Then, I sat with them as they watched tv, and there's apparently an evangelical tv station specific to the state we live in that featured a whole platform for the My Pillow guy. He really seems to have recently claimed Christian evangelical affiliation to cash in on sales, but he's seen as a blessed guy with inside knowledge. 

These relatives were born in the late 40s. They understand the internet and data caps, are learning about bitcoin, know how to stream, have run businesses, and aren't confused about how to use their phones. They're not stupid, don't reject technology out of hand, and read more than the bible alone. 

Their true sole connection to this stuff is their faith, and church community. They believe all this stuff has to do with god, and godly values. I know it's popular to see all faith and church as inherently stupid and flawed, but I don't agree. In fact, I feel that people's unwillingness to try to find a peaceful compromise between rationality and religious philosophy has given these irrational nightmares the power to flourish.  

My Q family knows I don't hold with Christian or conservative views, and still loves me. They're loving, family oriented people. It's still scary to know that they're waiting for some fantastical conspiracy to unfold. It's disturbing that they could influence minds that are less rational than their own.

Anyway, this is the second friend of mine to pass in the last like three months and I texted my mom to let her know and maybe get a little comfort but I haven‚Äôt heard from her at all since then.

I just got so mad... She has the time to spew conspiracy theories when a stupid meme is sent but no time to even offer the slightest comfort to her daughter.

Wade shouldn‚Äôt even be up for discussion at this point. It‚Äôs *my* body...NOT God‚Äôs, NOT my husband‚Äôs, NOT the fetus‚Äôs, and sure as hell NOT the fucking states‚Äô. But QPerson told me I was overreacting, and basically answered, ‚ÄúIf they *do* overturn Roe v. Wade, it‚Äôll be to fight the Deep State!‚Äù No it won‚Äôt...it‚Äôll be because this country harbors some goddamn deep-seated misogyny and wants to punish women for having sex in any way they can. If they really gave a shit about unborn babies‚Äô lives, they‚Äôd be advocating to control men‚Äôs bodies, too. Not that I think anyone‚Äôs body should be controlled, but...at least have there be some consistency?

Anyway, it took me a bit before I finally realized that my QPerson, aside from her obvious fascist tendencies, just plain doesn‚Äôt want any younger women having rights. What does she care...she‚Äôs in her mid-60‚Äôs. New abortion laws won‚Äôt affect her. Besides...*her* perfect generation was the one that jump-started feminism (never mind the Suffragettes, I guess). So, I finally snapped at her during a heated discussion one day and said, ‚ÄúYou just hate my generation and want to see us punished for something! That‚Äôs why you like Amy Barrett.‚Äù

And to that my Qultist replied, in a condescending tone with her nose in the air, ‚ÄúYeah...there‚Äôs some truth to that! Your liberal generation is very spoiled, and it‚Äôs high time you all got put in your place on something.‚Äù That something being...basic human rights. She doesn‚Äôt want the world to be a better place for future generations; she wants to see us suffer under authoritarianism because we‚Äôre not as racist, sexist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic as she is, and we don‚Äôt worship Donald Trump enough.

32,"A Different Strategy : Prosecute ""Q""","I am so sorry this happened to you, and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve found this community of others who are facing a similar struggle. As a student, I‚Äôm tired of hearing stories from young people who have lost family members to ‚ÄúQ‚Äù. As a veteran, I‚Äôm tired of hearing about people I used to know who have joined a paramilitary organization after being recruited online from a QAnon forum. To an extent, I believe the advice that not arguing about doctrine or facts with adherents is essentially correct[\[i\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn1), but also misses a key component of what people *can* do about QAnon. Namely, demand the prosecution of the individual(s) who radicalized their loved ones in the first place: ‚ÄúQ‚Äù. 

It is rare that a cult is judged to be illegal in the United States, as they are shielded by the religious exercise protections of the First Amendment[\[ii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn2). Instead, successful prosecution typically hinges around charging their leaders for tangential crimes, such as kidnapping or forced imprisonment when they hold members against their will. Regardless of whether QAnon should be considered a cult, the same strategy for prosecution should be pursued. If successful, some people may finally walk away from QAnon. Perhaps more importantly, others may never be radicalized in the first place. 

Former President Trump was recently impeached for inciting a riot at the US Capitol based on his language to supporters. I don‚Äôt raise this as a political point, but instead to suggest that ‚ÄúQ‚Äù could easily be charged under a similar statute[\[iii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn3). ‚ÄúQ‚Äù‚Äôs 5000 posts, evidence for such a case, have already been catalogued and preserved[\[iv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn4) by their followers, whether they originally appeared on 4chan, 8chan, or 8kun. Moreover, much of the work of identifying ‚ÄúQ‚Äù has already been done by reporters using open-sourced information[\[v\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn5)[\[vi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn6)[\[vii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn7). If the government did decide to pursue legal action against ‚ÄúQ‚Äù, naming them wouldn‚Äôt require much additional effort. Remember - just because you rob a bank in a mask doesn‚Äôt mean you haven‚Äôt committed a crime. 

To that end, what I hope you‚Äôll consider doing is writing your elected representatives and asking them what they are doing to prosecute ‚ÄúQ‚Äù[\[viii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn8). When you write, help them understand that ‚ÄúQ‚Äù is a single account run by an individual or a small team, and that all QAnon theories are held together by this single linchpin.  Tell them that ‚ÄúQ‚Äù is not a novelty or a curiosity. They are a dangerous criminal, and they are still at large. To find the representative for where you live, follow this [link](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and enter your home address. Information about your senators can be found [here](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). If you have never written an elected official before, here are some additional pointers on how to effectively communicate with [legislators](https://www.aclu.org/writing-your-elected-representatives). Be direct, be specific, and tie it to your personal experiences wherever possible. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be a letter in the traditional sense; all representatives accept comments from their constituents through their websites. Moreover, if you live in a state where similar activity has occurred at a statehouse or governor‚Äôs mansion, consider writing local representatives and asking them what they are doing to prosecute under state laws. 

If charging ‚ÄúQ‚Äù for the Capitol riots sounds far-fetched, consider Officer Eugene Goodman, one of the heroes of January 6th. The rioter who led the charge against him was not dressed in political merchandise or waving a MAGA flag. Instead, he wore a black sweatshirt embolized with ‚ÄúQ‚Äù on it. According to the FBI, he had purposely positioned himself at the head of the mob ‚Äì ‚ÄúHe wanted to have his t-shirt seen on video so that ‚ÄòQ‚Äô could ‚Äòget the credit‚Äô‚Äù[\[ix\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn9). If foreign insurgents had stormed a military outpost with flags and shirts with ‚ÄúQ‚Äù all over them, we would know the identities behind the pseudonym already. 

Until ‚ÄúQ‚Äù is prosecuted, these tragedies will only continue, and more people will lose family and friends to the fringe. QAnon is already looking to March 4th as the next flashpoint[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn10), but there will always be another date until our leaders act. The House of Representatives came close to this realization a few months ago, when they voted to condemn QAnon and other fringe conspiracy movements[\[xi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn11). However, this condemnation lumped ‚ÄúQ‚Äù and those ‚ÄúQ‚Äù deceived together. By specifically targeting and prosecuting ‚ÄúQ‚Äù, we can begin to recognize those people as victims rather than criminals while simultaneously cutting off a recruiting tool for future extremists. I hope you will write and demand justice, both for yourselves and those too far gone to demand it themselves. As much of a long-shot as it might seem, it might be the best way to get them back.

33,Progress: good days and bad days,"...and I mean good and bad days for ME and my outlook! This is incredibly long and rambly, but maybe it will help someone. I'm mostly just typing it up for myself.

I found this sub about a month ago, and it made me pretty depressed. It was obvious that this is what had gotten into my SO of 4 years during covid. Over the summer, he got more interested in ""politics"", decided he was a libertarian now, and was visibly more angry and depressed (but never violent/physical, or anything towards me, I just didn't like his moodiness). I heard about redpills, new world order, technocracy, microchips in vaccines, and 5G. Most of the crazier-sounding bits were kept to himself, like he'd say something vague like ""all politicians are evil"" (to which I was like ""duh"" or ""of course""). All of the jargon sounded like nonsense, I brushed most of it off and said I didn't like to talk about politics with him. Mostly he just wouldn't shut up about it and wouldn't stop listening to it and it wasn't nice conversation. I told him that I couldn't be his politics buddy and that's okay, we can be partners without that, he needs to hang out with friends more and talk about this stuff with them instead. He never talked about Q directly.

When I found this sub it was a huge relief to find out what was happening, where it was all coming from. It was also very concerning with wtf he's gotten into! Even now, reading some of the more intense stories on here can make me really question my future with this man. Some days I try to figure out how things would go if we broke up (we aren't married but we live together and our lives are very intertwined). It's really hard not having him to talk to about this since I don't have many friends and don't see them with the pandemic going on. 

But I've learned a lot from all of you. I started to listen to him a little more. I told him that gaslighting me into thinking I disagreed with him only because I ""didn't know"" wasn't fair and I told him I plan to get the vaccine. I started disagreeing with him on specific points (just like ""that doesn't seem likely"" or ""what if that doesn't happen"" or just straight up ""I don't think that is true""). I've started googling the people he listens to (which seems really icky and dishonest, as does posting here!). I've gotten more insight into where he stands on things and we've started having date nights and I started trying to distract him away from his podcasts and computer outside of work hours as much as possible.

Whenever he suggests moving to a specific place or changing something about our life I question how genuine it is - is this him wanting this or did people on the internet suggest it? In reading a lot of the posts here I realized eventually that I just need to recognize my boundaries, which has mostly turned into me not being open to changing our original plans. But if he insists on breaking the law or making a change that I don't want, I will draw the line - either by telling him that this is not okay or by ending things then. This realization of my own boundaries made me feel a lot better overall. The problem with this (and what I've been trying to return to normal) is that now \*I'm\* not open to new ideas about our life together! I've been clinging to our original plans so much that I'm not considering alternatives like I normally would. 

For awhile I feel like I was faking everything just trying to figure out what was going on while remaining as supportive as I could. But I feel like as I understand things more I can see \*him\* again. He has some crazy ideas, but he's always had crazy ideas. I love his ability to question the status quo. I hated that he was angry about everything all the time and obsessed with his podcasts. Those things still happen but they are less frequent (as long as he isn't just hiding them now). 

I've learned how he got into all of this between documentaries and listening to him (and eavesdropping on his podcasts...). He is a tech-savvy, religious white dude who always wanted to quit his job and go live in the woods. There is a very specific group catering to these guys as part of the alternative medicine type Qs. I believe him when he says he has started to focus on the real content - stuff about things we've always watched. But it's like he's watching stuff we've always been into with ads for Q baked in or something. It's so hard to separate for me, whenever I see him listening to podcasts or watching whatever the hell platform the videos he's watching are on, I think he's just being further indoctrinated. But I have hope that it's not all pure Q stuff. It's never been like 100% of the most crazy theories like some of the rest of the people written about here, but a lot of the main ideas are there. It's like they cater to certain people by filtering out the less-believable stuff. 

He told me at some point that he no longer things that there are chips in the vaccine. But he still hates most vaccines. He bought some crypto, but not much and I convinced him to also save money in traditional USD as well. We have a small stock of food that I think is reasonable to be prepared for any disaster. We talk more and have date nights and have committed to going outside as much as possible as the weather gets better. Sometimes he talks about moving to a specific state (which I think is because of taxes or laws or something) and I remind him that we like the area we already picked.

My only real issue is the thing where we are having a discussion and his brain gets stuck on a Q thing that he has to tell everyone about, which interrupts me or others, or ignores where a conversation is going to go back to what is stuck in his brain. But he has this issue anyways (pre-Q). I'm trying to get better at calling him out. Sometimes he doesn't hear something like ""I need you to run the dishwasher after dinner"" because he's thinking about Q things, and then \*real\* things don't get done. It's frustrating but he knows he does it and is getting less argumentative when I call him out. It does feel like the anger is subsiding, at least a little bit.

I still love him. Besides ""politics"", we've always been a great match (as most of the other Qs, he's always been right-leaning). He hasn't done anything but be angry and repeat things he's heard and he was a victim of this nonsense (I'm including the gaslighting in the ""repeating"" part, we all know that's drilled into them!). And as far as I can tell, this subset of ideas was never the homophobic/racist/etc bunch, at least on the surface. They at least \*think\* they're doing things for the greater good. It's exhausting having to shut down theories or ideas one by one and I get scared and confused whenever I read some of the posts on here (I literally have to keep myself off of this sub sometimes, it can be as addicting as Q itself, lol). But the lines of communication are wide open and he's been very receptive to my points. I think he realizes what is at stake. 

I'm hopeful that as we can go do things outside things will improve. This damn pandemic needs to go away so these Qs can get out of their depression and back to talking to real humans.",QAnonCasualties
34,Losing my mom,"I‚Äôve never been in a situation where someone close to me, a blood relative, would give me up for a belief. When I think about it, my brain immediately sludges down to one point of consciousness, &amp; that‚Äôs me remembering to breathe. And it‚Äôs not even a good belief. Let‚Äôs try it out with some other big belief: Mom might say, ‚ÄúPeople should have freedom of religion. I don‚Äôt even have to listen to your arguments; you‚Äôre simply wrong. I will never agree with whatevTHIS is,‚Äù gestures to the scattered supplies &amp; a booklet entitled, ‚Äúpipebomb making at home, by boys club press.‚Äù OK now in that formula, sure you‚Äôd see the mom‚Äôs viewpoint. ‚ÄúHe kept breaking into the house &amp; stealing stuff. What could I do? I had to change the locks.‚Äù But....that Democrats are evil? That‚Äôs it? 

I‚Äôm her only child. My child is her only grandchild. I think she‚Äôs about ready to disown me, &amp; probably not will me the land I grew up on. We‚Äôre from rural Alabama. Family is everything there. Moved north for work when I was a kid. To PA, which I recently heard is called Alabama North. That‚Äôs about right, I‚Äôll tell you. Still, I feel my mom raised me to be fair, to see people equally. She had discomfort with this in person, but it was clearly the goal she reached for, for both of us. 

She remarried some years ago. Her husband was from right down the road. Ex-military, green beret in Korea. He‚Äôs that odd contradiction you see in some military people, in which they‚Äôve traveled a lot, yet have not been broadened by it. Because every time they saw a foreign population, they were trying to kill each other. (He‚Äôs fought ‚Äúa lotta them little brown people in KO-RE-a.) So he‚Äôs had her watching fox since before trump was elected. It‚Äôs all they watch. Now she says the blacks are laughing &amp; singing in the verizon store, the Koreans are buying up all the land around Atlanta, that you can‚Äôt even drive on the highways around Atlanta because you‚Äôll be carjacked by ‚Äúbig black men with guns, &amp; antifa.‚Äù (She said she saw a picture of a young man on tv &amp; he was wearing a shirt that said antifa &amp; so that‚Äôs how she knows it‚Äôs real.) She says there is a mosque somewhere out in the woods where she lives, &amp; there‚Äôs no road going to it. She says the local town has these middle eastern looking men who are so rude to women &amp; she‚Äôs heard they keep their people in compounds &amp; they run the new commercial hog farm &amp; are dumping everything into the creek &amp; now the creek is dead. I lamented sadly about all the tent cities popping up here in Seattle. She said they have some around there in the nearby city, &amp; ‚Äúthose people are just lazy. They just don‚Äôt want to work. Just looking for a handout.‚Äù I mean she‚Äôs saying this about people living on parking berms, in the winter, in tents. Oh, almost forgot - the Mexicans are taking all the carpentry jobs in north Alabama. 

Did I leave anyone out? Black, antifa, anyone remotely Asian, all middle eastern, Mexican, homeless people. 

There are more than a few routes into this ‚Äúcaramel corn in my head‚Äù condition. In her case, she doesn‚Äôt partake of Qanon. She is not nimble on the computer, &amp; she‚Äôs in a rural area, so the connection sucks, because it‚Äôs a monopoly out there. So she‚Äôs not learning anything q-ish online. And of course fox isn‚Äôt going to say anything bad about them, if they say anything at all.

She LOVES nature, which the GOP hates. I might have predicted that she‚Äôd hear about Trump removing protections somewhere, &amp; that would make her a one issue voter. Yea...nope. 

And I don‚Äôt think she thinks Trump is the messiah, or the best president, or any of that. 

It seems to be that she just hates democrats. Which is interesting. Fox &amp; their ilk don‚Äôt need to sell any one idea hard enough to make people buy it. It‚Äôs enough to have a low murmur of ear fluff, as long as it‚Äôs unceasing. My impression is my mother doesn‚Äôt have even one strong opinion on any position or topic. She‚Äôs just been spending every evening listening to her husband yell in agreement with fox, which is just about at the point of declaring Democrats have cooties. 

So...that‚Äôs it. She hates the democrats. She probably knows about 3 democrats personally, she‚Äôs related to all three, so what are you gonna do? So aaaaaaaaaaaaall the rest of the hated democrats are people she‚Äôll never met, never talk to, nothing. And she‚Äôll give up her only child &amp; grandchild for that. People after the election ‚Äúoh, we shouldln‚Äôt be harsh, we need to reach across the aisle.‚Äù Are you kidding me? This is my OWN MOTHER &amp; she might as well be living on Mars. It just breaks my heart. For both of us. She seems miserable. But she‚Äôs where she wants to be. The people encouraging these beliefs have that cult rule of -if anyone is asking questions, it‚Äôs because they are the enemy &amp; they are trying to keep you from believing THE TRUTH. I reach out to her, but before we even make contact she‚Äôd skittered away, hissing &amp; spitting. 

As to the vaccine, here comes another example of how one can pick &amp; choose from the conspiracies like a brain fat buffet. She DOES believe in COVID, as well as vaccines. She &amp; he are old. I suspect your willingness to forego medical care just to show you‚Äôre not a sheeple can by highly correlated with your age. I know they wear masks, &amp; isolate. And, boy, out there in the country, that isolation stuff is real. Her husband got his first shot in December, I think; at the VA because he‚Äôs a vet. She, 80, was unable to find a vaccine. 

About 2 weeks before the inauguration, we had the following discussion. She said, ‚Äúremember I said Bob got his first shot?‚Äù ‚ÄúYea,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhen does he get is 2nd?‚Äù Her voice gets hard. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not. Biden said they have to give out all the vaccines now, so there won‚Äôt be any 2nd vaccines. He tried to get a shot at the hospital. They said they didn‚Äôt have any because Biden made them give them all out. And that they weren‚Äôt allowed to give them any of what they had.‚Äù (They have them &amp; also they don‚Äôt have them??) I was exasperated. ‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm sure Biden &amp; Harris will do the best with... (the hot mess they‚Äôve been left with, I‚Äôm thinking...) what they have,‚Äù I finish. ‚ÄúBiden &amp; Harris ARE the problem!‚Äù She shrieked. Then hung up. She does a lot of hanging up. 

Shortly after, I sent a newsy letter. Had to insert a line saying Biden hadn‚Äôt been inaugurated yet, so he had literally no power over any of their vaccine experiences. 

She said she couldn‚Äôt find a place to get the shot. I went online &amp; used the PA heat map to find a spot over the mountains, about an hour away. She called &amp; told me they told her to try back in 6 months. Hmmmmm do I have doubts? Maybe so, maybe so. That evening I call &amp; say I found 8 places in one town, also about an hour away. The next day I call &amp; she says none of them have anything (which is the opposite of what the state vaccine map says). I offer to keep looking. She starts ranting that it‚Äôs all political, that the whole world is political. And I thought, she‚Äôs not going to get a vaccine. It‚Äôs not because she believes they implant chips, it‚Äôs not because god will heal everything, it‚Äôs not because it would prove Covid is real. One reason: Biden prevented the shots when Trump was still in office. If she gets a shot now, now that Trump is OUT of office, it means Biden did something right, or at least will get the credit (in her fevered brain) because he‚Äôs president when she gets her shot. On a related &amp; highly infuriating side note, they do have the vaccine in the small town 10 min down the road. But the state line is between her &amp; there. It‚Äôs 5 miles from her house. She can‚Äôt go there, she has to go over the mountains, an 80yo at the wheel. 

Do you see the level of crazy here? She would rather skip a potentially lifesaving vaccine, which she fully believes in, just to own the libs. ‚ÄúBiden can‚Äôt do anything right.‚Äù *cough*

If she had cancer, or just dropped down dead, there would be a marker for me. A thing to say, ‚ÄúHere, start mourning NOW. Go find a book about losing someone to cancer. Join an online support group for sudden death.‚Äù We have maps for these things. For me, every phone call puts me in mourning. I don‚Äôt know where this is going. There is no medicine she can take for this, to make her regain her health. It‚Äôs just sad. I‚Äôm sad.",QAnonCasualties
35,I miss my mom so much.,"Edit: This kind of blew up so I edited out some of the more specific details, but everything you guys are saying is so helpful and so appreciated. I hope I can get back to everyone who has responded but if I don't, know your support has been super appreciated. 

I'm making my first post here because I'm so sick and sad I don't know what to do. My mom was always my best friend, the person I went to for everything under the sun. She's always been a republican, and I went from being her good republican daughter to a total democrat (I'm in my 30s now), but even then we still had a great relationship as long as we avoided political discussions. Now everything is different.

I don't know if she's into Q specifically, but she is deep in the conspiracies that I believe Q is rooted in. Every once in while over the past decade (at least) she'd bring up something about the New World Order and other associated stuff. I never took it seriously and shut it down. It seemed about as harmful as talking about alien abductions and area 51. (Now seeing advice on how to deal with loved ones in a cult, I feel like I handled everything wrong and it is so hard to not blame myself for dismissing her and for the times our political conversations actually devolved into yelling matches.)

But now with the pandemic, she has gone off the rails. Gradually she got sucked into this mindset that Covid is fake. Or it's not fake and it was created in a lab. The number of deaths is inflated. Doctors are refusing to treat patients with actual life savings drugs (hydroxychloroquine, etc). The vaccines are unsafe. And because of her beliefs, she continues to live her life like nothing is happening.

[This is where a lot of the post got really specific so please forgive me for deciding to remove it.]

I guess maybe this is only loosely related to this sub, being that she has very Q beliefs about the virus. There are other things too, like how all of the main stream news is fake and the election was stolen. The thing is, she always disliked Trump... up until the election. I have been to afraid to ask her specifically about Q, but like I said, she's been into the OG conspiracy stuff for years so it seems likely. She sees everything happening now as proving all of her theories right, that this has all been planned for the last 50 years.

I'm sorry this is so long. I've spent a lot of time yesterday and today crying and talking to my fiance and trying to wrap my head around what's happening, I think it's time I have a wider support group. It just sucks so much.",QAnonCasualties
36,They finally mentioned adrenochrome. They surprisingly still don't know much about Q.,"I have a family member who's... definitely into conspiracy theories. Granted, they were usually the funny and harmless ones like aliens, cryptids, and area 51. We saw a QAnon sign in front of a house and they asked me what it was, so I basically infodumped everything. I even cited my sources. 
They genuinely recognized most of it. I explained that a lot of Q stuff has roots in antisemitism, and they thankfully believed me... on some of it. They still believe in the adrenochrome thing, and seemed to imply that the antisemitism connection is an unfortunate coincidence. They still didn't recognize the name Q, they didn't know what 4chan is, and they didn't know about the whole ""jfk is alive"" theory. I'm hoping that stays that way. I recommended a few debunking videos (""In Search of a Flat Earth"" by... I forgot the guy's name, and ""What is QAnon?"" by iiluminaughtii), and I'm desperately praying that they take the hint. They're by no means a hateful or bad person. They aren't racist, they don't force their politics on anyone, they aren't homophobic or transphobic, etc. But I've heard stories from this sub about previously kind people practically changing overnight. I almost feel like sticking around on this sub was like... God warning me, or something. I dunno. I just needed to vent, I guess.",QAnonCasualties
37,My 79 year old grandma doesn't want to take the coronavirus vaccine.,"Well, she is not exactly a Qanon causality, but she is the the equivalent here in Brazil. She always believed in many strange naturopaths snake oils, so she was always at risk to become a QAnon causality. She started believing in many right wing WTF conspiracy theories during the 2018 elections (she voted for the fascist candidate, bolsonaro). I already knew what would happen. I tried to to stop it but in the end I was powerless. The only social media she uses is whatsapp and talks mostly to other ""qanon"" people, so the few hours per week of help didn't work. Since March, she only talks about bill gates and the globalists, evil vaccines and all that bullshit. She is antimask (wears them because it's mandatory) and believes that taking vitamin d makes you immune to covid (and believes in chlorochlorine). At first she believed it was just a little flu but after many people she knew died (more than 10) she changed her mind, but still refuses to be vaccinated. What can I do do change her mind?

She died December 9th. Not sure the vaccine would have saved her, we're all old enough to be having health issues, she had something that dogged her for a long time.

Other guy wears an expensive Sig Sauer on his hip, has been ranting about the ""ChiCon virus"" for the last year. He's owed me a package for several months, can't raise him. We're the same height, he's got about seventy pounds on me. I'm starting to get a bad feeling here.

40,"I know, and I'm trying very hard not to hold it against you.","My dad is a member of the Qult. He was always very narcissistic growing up, a dictator in his own home.  He beat me for everything from bad grades to back talking.

I have a few good memories with him, but most of my memories revolve around walking on eggshells because I was scared of him.  When I was a teen, he let me read his journal (which, looking back, was more of a manifesto) and one of the things he wrote in it was that he believed that all addicts should be forced to consume every bit of drugs found on them if and when arrested, whether it kills them or not.  Thats the kind of person he is.  He has no empathy.  

I wound up addicted to meth at one point. (Thank god ive been clean for quite a few years now, no thanks to him.)  He still believes these things knowing that I used to be an addict.

Now on to the meat of the story.

I havent had a relationship with him for years, but somehow we bonded over NASCAR recently.  I started playing iracing and he asked me to make youtube videos so that he could watch me race.  We started watching NASCAR together (from opposite ends of the country) this year.

During this whole time he has been saying nasty things about liberals, using the word ""lib #%$@"" ect.  But even though im a liberal, I just ignore it because I want to have this relationship with him.  I havent told him I'm a liberal, I just ignore his rants or change the subject.

The other day I told him I really liked Bubba Wallace (he is a black nascar driver and advocate of black lives matter)  and my dad said he wasnt thrilled with him BECAUSE of black lives matter.  

He spouted that nonsense about ALL lives mattered the same, and I figured it was safe to teach him that its not about black people thinking they were better, it was about cops treating them as if they were inferior.  

""Its not black lives matter MORE, its black lives matter TOO""

His response was that they should change the slogan to be less confusing.  I dropped it then, but I should have told him that its NOT confusing except to the people that were the problem.

The other day we were talking about how the NASCAR championship works and he made a comment ""Nascar must be run by liberals, they make everything so hard""

I figured this was pretty tame, so I said ""I guess this is a good time to tell you that I'm a liberal""

I guess I figured that if he knew, hed ease up on the hurtful remarks.  This wasnt really the case though, because the next words out of his mouth were probably the most hurtful things he's ever said to me.

""I know and I'm trying very hard not to hold it against you""

All I replied was ""me too, so lets not talk politics at all""  and he POUNCED on that idea and made it his own.  

""Yeah we can either fight or we can talk racing, but we cant do both, I vote racing""

This was a week ago, and I have to give him this, he hasnt made any more comments.

I keep going back to that ""I know, and I'm trying hard not to hold it against you.""  This bothers me and is eating me up on so many levels.

First of all, how dare he? I can understand thinking those thoughts, because I feel the same way about him... But how dare he voice them to me like that?  Making me feel like its a chore to love me?  I mean I DID say ""me too"" to him, but that was a reflex.  He hurt me and I lashed out.  Very tamely I might add.

Secondly, and heres where it gets worse....

If he knew, then he was making all thise comments KNOWING it was hurtful to me.

If he didn't know, then he was lying to me.  Which is some REAL bullshit because he used to beat me when he caught me in a lie, and then beat me again over whatever I lied about.

I think that it might be in my best interest to just drop him completely, but for some reason I really dont want to.  Its so hard to just let go.  I dont know what to do here.

Sorry for the rant, I know this isnt r/relationship_advice but I needed somewhere to vent.

47,The conspiracy conspiracy,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but seeing as how many of the posts here talk about losing loved ones to conspiracy theories, i think it may be appropriate.

My mother, grandfather and many friends and acquaintances have all been, for lack of a better word, possessed by this conspiracy mind virus that has been going on. I'm not from the US, but i find many similar elements of the QAnon conspiracy spreading even here.

""Bill Gates and the satanic elite have created the coronavirus as an excuse to chip us all so that we can be mind controlled  by the 5G network! Oh and they're all blood drinking pedophiles hell-bent on putting placentas and aborted foetuses into LITERALLY EVERYTHING""

This is only a slight exaggeration, but only a slight one, as anyone who has spent an extended amount of time speaking to these people can attest.

That isn't to say that every conspiracy theory is necessarily false, just look at MK Ultra. Though there's a slight leap i believe between ""the government is doing shady shit and ""there's a cabal of satanists trying to murder the planet, who may or may not be lizard people (read: jews)""

Trying to shoot down the many.. many obviously false and ludicrous claims has drained a lot of my energy, and quite frankly a good chunk of my sanity too. Why? Well, here's an example:

Early on in the pandemic there were images and stories floating around of a green canister with ""COVID-19"" photoshopped on it. If i remember correctly the image itself was older than the pandemic by quite a lot, besides the fact that it was painfully obvious that the text was added digitally. 
Well, not obvious enough apparently as it spread through social media of many different countries.

Or how about that ""5G tower motherboard with COVID19 printed on it"", that was actually taken from an old VCR? Like you could look it up by a code printed on the board and see where it came from.

This wasn't just random misinterpretation of information that just became viral, this was purposeful disinformation put out there to feed into this growing lunacy. Why? Is it 4chan just pulling shit to mess with people to get a laugh? It's either that, or there's a conspiracy to spread conspiracies around to put the masses into panic mode so that no one gets vaccinated and we all DIE or the global economic system collapses and the lizard people can finally take over the world and drink baby blood out of capri sun packages!

You see what this shit is doing to me? I'm not actually serious about the second part of what i wrote but goddamn does the madness spread. And there's nothing you can do about it.
It has become like a religion, and your belief in the conspiracy is the only way you can reach salvation and therefore those caught in this madness believe it's their moral duty to convince you that it's true so that you don't get microchipped by Microsoft!

Who the fuck keeps spreading these lies? Why?! AAAAAGH!

Hey all, new here. My mom has really been into QAnon ever since it got started and all I hear about these days is her talking about all of the messed up theories and I haven't been able to have a ""normal"" conversation with her since the pandemic started. She has always been very far right and it just got worse in the months leading up to Trump's inauguration in 2016, but this is a new level of messed up stuff.

 Background info:  At first, when the 2016 presidential campaigns started, she supported Ted Cruz and she didn't support Trump until my grandparents told her that they supported him, showing all of these (in my opinion) stupid reasons and overall showing that they didn't really respect minorities and LGBT+ people. I came out as a lesbian when I was 13 (so, almost 7 years ago as I'm almost 20 now) and I knew that they didn't really support me from how they reacted (mom tried to say that I didn't know what I was feeling/talking about, grandparents threatened my parents to essentially lock me away in my room and take away my phone). So, when the 2016 election came about, my grandparents and my mom were actively and openly supporting Trump. That felt like a huge blow to me because of me being LGBT+. But, that's not the end of that. All of them are transphobic and I realized that I was genderqueer/fluid within the past year and I told that to my parents. My mom reacted super badly and my dad didn't say much and it was overall an awful experience. I've never told my grandparents about it, knowing how they reacted to me coming out as gay because they're more transphobic than homophobic. So, I didn't feel safe to tell them. My dad isn't in this equation much because he has always been afraid of telling my mom what he thinks about things and he's a pretty quiet guy, versus my mom being a very loud person. He's very much a guy that gets walked all over when it comes to her and he has some bad mental health issues. I, also, suffer with a bunch of mental health problems, including MDD, C-PTSD, possibly AvPD (still going to therapy to see if I do have that, but I show pretty much every single symptom), severe anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and a bunch of other things. So, I've been pretty much labeled as a sick person who doesn't know themself and is just crazy. My dad, on the other hand, is kinda a pushover.

How it started: Before quarantine, when all of the COVID stuff was new on the news, my mom and grandparents took it seriously and took the needed precautions for things. But then, my mom doing info research on COVID stuff, she came across QAnon stuff and that's when things started going downhill. She became obsessed with the things those people were talking about and taking them as fact. At first I was like, oh this isn't too serious and just some more bs she hears from far right people. But, oh my god I was so wrong. 

How it's going: She got more and more into QAnon and to the point where she wouldn't talk to me or my dad because she'd be watching another video of that stuff. Anytime I would address it and how it was complete bs, she would say that I've been brainwashed and that I need to listen to her because she's right. Then, anytime I tried to challenge the things she has ""learned"" from her QAnon videos, she'd get really angry, start saying that no one takes her seriously, and that we think that she's stupid. It got to the point where she was victimizing herself. I talked to my therapist about it and my sister (who has been moved out since 2017 and isn't into QAnon and is very much the opposite of my mom and grandparents) and they both suggested that I should ask her to not talk about politics and the like around me. So, I asked her and she essentially said that that's ""part of her personality and that she's trying to save people from the bad people in the world"". I still tried to let her know how it made me feel (anxious, on edge, scared, etc.), but she didn't listen. She keeps talking about the QAnon stuff and idk what to do anymore. It just sucks so much because she essentially supports people who are against people like me (LGBT+) and even my dad (he's mixed, half Asian/a PoC). It's like a blow to the heart anytime she talks about it and I can't move out yet because I've been working on my mental health issues (which have been really bad), so I haven't been able to work to get the money to leave. I spend so many nights crying because I feel like I don't know my mom or grandparents anymore and I keep asking myself why and how did this happen. I've been trying to educate my mom about the LGBT+ community and trying to talk to her about the struggles PoC go through (that white privilege is real), but she never listened.

It feels like a lot of the time, I failed in educating her about those groups of people who have more difficult lives than she does just based off of their race or sexual/gender identity because QAnon is very much not supportive of BLM and couldn't care less about LGBT+ people and what they/us go through. I've tried playing devil's advocate for the opposing side of what she believes, but it doesn't make a difference. Things still stay the same. She has turned into this cold hearted, distant person and it doesn't even feel like I have a mother anymore. She goes to a bunch of Trump rallies, protests, and is an anti-masker. I don't even know what she's doing day by day because she doesn't tell me and I wake up nearly every day to her being gone. She would tell my dad in passing as she's going out to where she was going and what she was doing, but she wouldn't tell any of us ahead of time. I hardly ever really see her anymore and I just feel a profound sense of loss from how far gone she is into QAnon. It's like the empathy for other people has been sucked out of her and replaced by a QAnon programmed robot. She used to be such a nice woman that would listen to other people's thoughts, feelings, and opinions and would put herself in their shoes. Now, all I have to compensate for that is a whole closet full of food and stuff that she's hoarding when (in her words) ""shit goes down"" and the QAnon stuff goes into effect. Idk what to do and I struggle with seeing how that stuff makes sense at all. A lot of it feels like a stretch and a lot of it doesn't add up to me. She praises Trump like he's Jesus himself and I don't understand how someone can support someone like him. I'm a very empathetic person, to a fault, but I'm struggling to make sense of it all. At the same time, none of it makes sense. It feels like I'm going crazy and I'm glad that I was able to find this community because it has been such a lonely and anxiety inducing situation. It has effected my sleep profoundly (I've had bad insomnia from it and I'm on sleep meds, so it's been THAT bad) and I'm just lost. Idk what to do anymore or what to feel.",QAnonCasualties

68,How can I heal someone else's strong sentiment against Authority?,"Nice to meet you all, I did not know something like this existed, and I appreciate any response from you all.

I want to say that I believe from watching my mother that most of her belief in this kind of ideas comes from her strong rejection of authority, she was raised only by my grandmother, we all love grandma but she has always been very distrustful of anyone trying to ""control"" her, she had some bad experiences with our grandfather and multiple people on her life that left her wanting to be alone and trying to be the only variable that controls her life (and god too), she sees with disgust and distrust people like politicians, cops, rich people, etc anyone that is in a position of more power than her.

My mother is aware of that behavior from my grandmother but she can not see that she carried some of that herself, maybe not in the same way but she has the belief that it's important to protect her individuality from being restricted if my grandmother would refuse to call the police because she doesn't trust men coming to her house even if they could do, god knows what to her daughter, my mother would not be as irrational but would do things like changing her path if police are on sight, even though she is not doing anything wrong, try to go through closed roads even though they are marked as dangerous as not to fall prey in her mind to some sort of sheep mentality, doesn't believe in the Christian God because our grandmother ( which is valid but we can see the resentment towards grandma and she trying to force her religion ).

This even if subtle translates to a lot of things in my mother's life, we all know she does this and nobody looks at it as something dangerous, heck compared to what our grandmother does is nothing. That was before she started watching conspiracy theories with my father.

My father and the rest of the family began to watch this kind of stuff on cable and on the internet and quickly lost interest in the thing but my mother kept on watching it on her phone in her free time, she would comment us this and that and we would just take it as a simple conversation. Now we have begun to worry about her, she refuses to wear a mask, we had to vaccinate our little brother behind her back as not to annoy her. Se didn't go to vote because she said the elections are meaningless now but the thing that worried us the most is that she managed to find people with similar ideas to her and began to go to a club to talk about these conspiracies and they almost went to that rally to ""stop Biden"".

I feel lucky that is not something as severe as it could be, but since we realize the danger that these things can make, I have taken to myself to help her.

But I don't know if is possible for me to help her, every time we try to speak with her she gets defensive and it always goes back and forth into the same thing, she feels she is liberating herself in some way shape, or form and that she can not place her trust on other people and she is constantly looking for some sort of impossible independence from everything.

I didn't know it was a sentiment that came from conspiracies, she has this idea of some utopia without the influence of the massive media (except for the ""alternative media""), without technology (except her phone) with free spirituality (these cheap ""new era"" **enlighten** that these groups tend to sell).  We used to joke with her that that's what grandfather used to have when he was a farmer and he still passed away from drinking his troubles away.

We feel she disconnects more and more from reality and we want to stop it now that is early. any comments would help. Thanks in advance.",QAnonCasualties

71,I am a former believer in Q and this is what changed my mind,"**(throwaway to protect my identity)**  


I would like to offer you good people an additional angle when talking to Q believers that I haven‚Äôt seen here so far.

I will describe the thinking-process that led to my rejection of Qanon and then some pointers that may help inducing this process in others.  

**My process**  



After descending deeper and deeper into everything Q, I was suffering a psychotic breakdown. I realized I could no longer discern truth from fiction and fell into a deep depression for two weeks. As an unintended side-effect, I went through a digital detox.

And here is the epiphany that got me back into real-life: 

There are two possibilities: Either Q is right or Q is wrong. It would have to be one or the other. If Q is wrong, then there is no need for me to busy myself with it. If, however Q is right, then‚Ä¶what? Why would I need to follow every new piece of information being dropped? If it is all true, then all should be revealed soon, for everyone to see. In that case, there is also no need for me to busy myself with it.

This realisation might seem unsatisfying at first, but it taught me an almost spiritual lesson: 

There are things in this world that I do not know and cannot know for sure. And that is ok.

I was lucky to come to that realisation by my own, but not everyone will. So here are some angles that might help move someone else there.

Information addiction is a real thing. Small bits of information that are just interesting enough but don‚Äôt challenge our short attention spans. Twitter et al. know this, news-channels know this, and so do conspiracy boards. So try to convince the person to do this. Hell, make it a challenge and join in yourself (this is beneficial for everyone).  


**Be humble and avoid authority arguments**  


Authority arguments (i.e. referring to scientists or whatever news outlet you deem reputable) cannot work because central part of Qanon is the untrustworthiness of those institutions. And be honest, your trust in those institutions is just that ‚Äì trust (however legitimate it might be). Instead, be humble and go for the angle I described in my epiphany.  


**Don‚Äôt equate conservatism with Q**  


While reading some posts in this sub I got the impression that most users here hold left-leaning views, which is of course legitimate. I held conservative views before I got into Q and I still do. If questioning Q would have meant questioning my whole political identity, I doubt I would‚Äôve gotten out. This is a mental health issue, not a political one.  

**EDIT 1**  

Please don't derail this into a discussion about politics. I am aware that the vast majority if not all Q believers hold conservative views. My point is that it is easier to give up Q if that doesn't mean you have to give up long held political views.

**EDIT 2**  

I should have mentioned I am from Germany. We have a sizeable Q movement here. Please stop asking me about my opinions on US politics.

**EDIT 3**  

There's a lot of questions about the state of Q in Germany coming in, so here is an article in [english](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/world/europe/qanon-is-thriving-in-germany-the-extreme-right-is-delighted.html) and one in [german](https://www.swr.de/swr2/leben-und-gesellschaft/qanon-wie-die-verbreitung-in-deutschland-funktioniert-100.html). Personally, I did not use german channels at all but american ones. I got in and out before it really got big here.  

**EDIT 4**  

It seems like I ruffled some feathers with this post. I am open to discussion but before you comment, please read the existing comments first. There is a moderate to high likelihood that I already responded to the point you want to raise. Thank you.",QAnonCasualties

73,Q husband,"Hi. I‚Äôm new here and my heart is breaking.  My husband is a true believer of Q. It has happened in such a short time too. It‚Äôs been 2 months that he really took hold of it and ran with it. He has other family members that believed before him but they got him.  It has greatly affected our marriage and it was already suffering. We decided to do counseling before he really fell down the hole and we can‚Äôt even work on those issues because this takes priority in counseling. We were raised very conservative Christian but as adults had more progressive Christian views but now he‚Äôs like brimstone and fire. Things we were against before. Says God has told him to spread the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù about the second harvest. Believes all these people are alive. Just 3 months ago we talked about how we both agreed Michael Jackson was a bad man and he said he was a sick fuck. Now, Michael Jackson faked his own death because he had to and was wrongfully accused. And is posing as The Weeknd? What?!?!  I‚Äôm a stay at home mom, without an income. He seems to think all debt is going to be wiped away because of all the silver and gold they found under the Vatican. Doesn‚Äôt want to pay credit card or other types of bills and to ‚Äújust wait‚Äù.  Talks about going to get me a new car. We have 3 amazing beautiful children. People are like just leave. Ugh it‚Äôs not that simple. My kids depend on me for 90% of their lives. He can‚Äôt work and take care of them and frankly i prefer that he‚Äôs not around them as much right now because of his views. I want to fight for our marriage but i am exhausted. I‚Äôve been reading tips on how to deal with these people. I‚Äôm trying to come at him with love but I‚Äôm just heartbroken. This is destroying our marriage and family. All logic out the window. He constantly repeats ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù and ‚Äú the hope and faith i feel is incredible‚Äù.

74,Gave up arguing,"Every time another ""big prediction"" didn't come true I was hoping there could be a chance that I get my dad back and would be able to have a conversation with him that wouldn't end in an argument. My last hope was that after Biden's inauguration he would finally start to question all this nonsense. But as usual Q came up with another BS explanation and once again I couldn't reach him with sane arguments. I fought him a long time on this subject, tried to tell him that he needs to question his sources too, not just the main stream media. Last time he sent me a video from a parliament session in Denmark, were the prime Minister and the representatives were allegedly laughing uncontrollably about how they locked down the whole nation for no reason. Turns out the video was from October 2019 and they were discussing finding a retirement home for the last 4 circus elephants the state adobted after Denmark banned wild animals from circus shows.
It's really frustrating because there are  times where I'd really need him to just be my dad but instead he sends me articles and videos I can debunk with one Google search or just simple logic and calling me indirectly a sheep or a coward or blinded by the matrix.",QAnonCasualties

76,how do i tell them that they're delusional,"My parents keep believing all of the nonsense they see on Facebook. Yet ironically enough, they label every mainstream media fake news, of course, except for Fox News. They are asian immigrants from Vietnam and grew up during the communist age, so because of what they've experienced through out their childhood, they're now paranoid and consider everything that's not aligned to their views ""communist"". I thought that after the inaugeration of Biden would this end but nope, somehow, the biased ""news"" (I use news in heavy quotation marks because if you could understand the language you'd be horrified to see how this would even slightly be considered journalism) that they listen to turned it into more fake news, continuing the Qanon bullshit. Their entire facebook wall is filled to the brim with absolute garbage and false news and I have no idea how to help them. At this point, it isn't even Qanon anymore, just generally false information. For example, a few weeks ago, they saw some ""news"" journalist speak about how Mcdonald's uses human meat in their burgers, which to the average person would be absolutely insane for a number of different factors, but they actually believed it. I tried pulling up MULTIPLE news sources that have debunked this claim, but they respond with ""fake news"" and shut me down.

How the hell do I get through to them?",QAnonCasualties
77,I am worried about my QAnon mom,"Obligatory disclaimer that I (M 19) am a long-time lurker and am posting on a throwaway.


Up until last year, my mom (F 40‚Äôs) identified as a democrat. When quarantine happened, she was terrified of our family getting getting the virus. She never left the house unless it was to get groceries, stocked up on hand sanitizer/hand wipes, always wore plastic gloves, and bought an unnecessary amount of (non-disposable) masks. Around this time, she started spending a lot of her free time on her phone. I didn‚Äôt know what she was doing until a while later.

One day, I got a Twitter notification that someone on my contact list just made an account. When I saw it was my mom, I checked her account out of curiosity. What I saw was worrying.

At first, it was mostly tweets about spirituality. Then it slowly turned into retweets from QAnon accounts, mostly about #savethechildren and how vaccines cause autism (for context, my younger brother and I are on the spectrum. My mom has always been a little weary of vaccines since my brother got diagnosed ). She never talked about this stuff in person so I didn‚Äôt bring it up to her.

Now it‚Äôs all she talks about. She talks about how celebrities like John Legend and Tom Hanks are Satanic baby-eating pedophiles, while she worships the ground Donald Trump walks on. For months, she‚Äôs been telling my dad and I that things are going to change, that all these celebrities are getting killed, arrested, resurrected (I am not kidding about this one) whether we decide to ‚Äúkeep drinking the kool-aid‚Äù. 

Two months ago her Twitter account got suspended. I thought this would help her in some way but it didn‚Äôt. Instead, this obsession of trying to prove everyone who was ‚Äúagainst her‚Äù wrong got worse.

I am really worried about her. She had always struggled with her mental health for as long as I can remember but for the most part she was alright mentally and emotionally. That was until all of this started. She went through periods of not taking her medication, making her go through terrible withdrawals. She would snap at me if I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúagree‚Äù with her, called me a sheep, that one day she‚Äôll prove me wrong, and more. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",QAnonCasualties
78,What happened to my mom?,"Today I got the covid vaccine. It was a very simple process. I am 26 but considered an essential worker and could get the vaccine.

My mom drove me as do not have a car at the moment. Initially the nurses thought my mom, 67, was going to get the vaccine as she is the older one. My mom told the nurses she refuses to get it. She is a prime candidate and has asthma. She watched me get it and asked the nurse ‚ÄúDoes the syringe have a microchip?‚Äù The nurse tells her no. I felt really embarrassed.

I told her later that I thought it was a stupid question. But she said she had read it on the internet. ‚ÄúThey said the syringe would have a microchip.‚Äù I tried to do an exercise with her... Tried to make her think about what she was saying. 

‚ÄúWho is they?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúFrom an article I read.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is the article from.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember, it was on the internet.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúWell Moderna never said they would put chips in the vaccine, so whoever they is is wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say there would be microchips in the vaccine, I said in the syringe!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would they put a microchip in a syringe?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo they can track people!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why would they want to track people?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo they can keep a record of how many people are using the vaccine and how they are doing.‚Äù

  ‚ÄúYou sign paperwork when you are vaccinated which would log your vaccination, and clinical trials are done to see effects before vaccines are pushed to market. You have an iPhone, if someone wanted to track you they can just use your phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe clinical trials... they don‚Äôt know what happens in clinical trials .‚Äù

She ignores all the other points I made. She pulls up on her phone a product being sold online called a Microchip Injector. ‚ÄúSee, I told you they have them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that have to do with the Moderna vaccine?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey said that they *could* have them in syringes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is they? Its not the government, or Moderna, that said that, so who?‚Äù

‚ÄúAn article I read on Facebook.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you got your news from Facebook?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt get my news from Facebook! But they said...‚Äù

And back and forth like this, where my Mom never questions her sources, or the absurdity of the conspiracy when taken to the logical conclusions.

My mom has slowly sunk into this hole where all she does is watch YouTube videos and sink into conspiracy theories. Some of them are Q lite stuff,  where she is spouting anti-Semitic stuff despite never having said anti-Semitic stuff in life before. Today is yet another stark reminder that my mom seems impossible to get through to, and even when given information on a topic, doesn‚Äôt seem to have the ability to understand the information... its scary because I don‚Äôt think she can help it. She‚Äôs not malicious, just incredibly naive.",QAnonCasualties
79,Q-think has been around for a long time by different names,"I've been reading a lot of these ""Q ate my family"" posts and my heart breaks for all of you.  I've been through a similar experience, but I left home before could bring my family back to sanity.

For context, I spent my junior/high school years living in the South in a three-generation family.  My grandfather got involved in a group that was at the time the religious arm of the alt-right.  Soon it encompassed our whole life - homeschooling because schools were indoctrination centers, new ""church"" because you can't believe what traditional preachers say, only ""natural medicine"" because ""doctors don't know anything and vaccines are poison""..... basically distrust of anyone not in our group. Violently racist because ""even the poorest white man is better than any \[insert slur here\]"".  

Additionally, they were heavily armed and believed the government would come at any time and take them to prison or kill them. When I was 16, my grandfather very carefully explained how, if the FBI came to the house and he was killed in the shoot-out, I was to bury him in the back 40 so no one would know he was dead and my grandmother could continue to collect his Social Security.  Funny thing is, the FBI did show up at their house once, but that's a whole 'nothing story.

So when I listen to what QAnon is preaching and how it takes over a person's life, I recognize it for the cult it is, and know how hard it is to leave.  The person would have to admit they were lied to, and then give up most of their social/online life.  What do you do when nearly everyone you know is in the same cult, especially when most of your human contact is online since one of the hallmarks of QAnon is throwing away any person who isn't a believer?

QAnon is the logical extension of the alt-right militias and white supremacist movements, all brought together by the Internet and Faux ""News"".  Deprogramming is possible; remember you really do love who they are under all the QAnon crap.",QAnonCasualties

82,QAnon Personality types,"I'm noticing commonalities across Qultists' personalities and social standing and thought I'd open it up for discussion to sort of profile the types that fall for baseless conspiracies.

I see a lot of people playing the aggrieved victim-blamer card, over and over. In fact, it is captured well in this article about the QAnon Shaman who now abdicates all personal responsibility for his actions in the Capitol riots and blames Trump for ""grooming"" him ([https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-shaman-whines-that-trump-groomed-him-and-millions-of-other-americans](https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-shaman-whines-that-trump-groomed-him-and-millions-of-other-americans)).

I also notice other people who, aside from their victim-blamer mentality, also feel a deep sense of entitlement for things that they have not worked to earn. For example, they didn't go to college and have no skills but they slam academics and think they should be earning as much as, say, the IT person with a masters and relevant marketable skills. 

Loneliness and a deep desire to ""belong."" I suppose after years of living a ground hog day existence, QAnon offered them a ticket out of the tedium and boredom of daily living.

My parents at this point are ""the 10 days of darkness was actually our consciousness going from 4D to 5D"" despite them getting supplies and literally taking cash out in preparation. They believe all he bad juju before the election happened and my miscarriage and the arguing within family was the transition toward a higher consciousness. Now that I'm not pregnant and there's little pressure on them to be covid safe, they think that everything is better. No the issues remain, I just an no longer high risk.

He‚Äôs like that a lot. He‚Äôll say something boldly wrong, we‚Äôll counter his points, and he‚Äôll just stumble over his words and say ‚Äúwell I see what you mean‚Äù and then leave the room. 

The most frustrating thing right now is him with COVID. 

For backstory, my dad is 63. He has lung issues, heart issues, is overweight, and is just generally very high risk. He‚Äôs the only parent we have, and my best friend. 

My dipshit brother now goes off about how ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt work because counties without mask mandates have the lowest cases‚Äù and that Fauci is lying or not to be trusted,  and he keeps on saying how the vaccines were made ‚Äútoo fast‚Äù (it would be a valid fear if I didn‚Äôt know he only thought that cause of false information). 

He‚Äôs constantly eating out at restaurants and going to public places to hang out despite us asking him not to. He works at a Valet place and I think it‚Äôs great that he‚Äôs working to support us and he always wears a mask there, but I just wish he‚Äôd stay home after. 

The most infuriating thing was yesterday when he started talking about how COVID wasn‚Äôt really a risk anymore cause numbers are going down, and he‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen going out all the time and hasn‚Äôt gotten it yet.‚Äù When my dad said that it‚Äôs likely cause he was wearing a mask he just said ‚Äúwell I clearly don‚Äôt wear them at restaurants lol.‚Äù 

He then said ‚Äúwell we‚Äôre all going to get it anyways‚Äù which made me want to cry because my dad is likely to fucking die if he gets it and my brother just doesn‚Äôt care. My dad and I are both clearly upset by it but my dad is really sweet and just keeps saying that he can‚Äôt control my brothers opinions. 

He‚Äôs welcome to have his stupid opinions, but when he‚Äôs putting us all at risk that‚Äôs when the line should be drawn. Be mad all you want, but just put your mask on and wash your hands and stop being a giant baby. 

He also wants to be a cop and I‚Äôm fucking terrified. I just know he‚Äôs the type of man to abuse his power. I‚Äôm already scared of him most of the time. Any disagreement can turn into a heated argument and it hurts my dad whenever we fight, so I just leave the room or be silent whenever he‚Äôs around. He‚Äôs borderline abusive to his girlfriend (I‚Äôm not around the two of them enough to know the full story, but she‚Äôs complained to me before about him giving her the ‚Äúsilent treatment‚Äù and similar things). We were both abused by our mom as a kid and I know this plays into it but he refuses to get help (he thinks mental illness is fake and psychiatry is a scam.). 

He‚Äôs also just fucking racist. Coming home from work talking about the ‚Äúloud/obnoxious black people‚Äù he had to deal with, or the ‚Äúimmigrants that could barely speak English‚Äù. 

There‚Äôs nothing I can do and I‚Äôve just accepted that I won‚Äôt have a relationship with him once he moves out, but it‚Äôs sucks. I‚Äôm an awful sibling too and I know he has reason to dislike me, I just wish it was left with personal disputes and not political bullshit that drives us apart. 

Sorry this was so long, just haven‚Äôt found a place I can‚Äôt rant about this before. Thx for reading.",QAnonCasualties

101,My family is gone,"I apologize if this is very rambling like. but this is heartbreaking. I am a high schooler just trying to have someone hear my cry for help.

Everyone in my house has different political ideas. My mom is a former republican who‚Äôs now a right leaning centrist. My dad is a liberal, and my grandma is almost out of her ‚Äúthis post on Facebook said..‚Äù phase (marvelous process made by her though!! She currently is waiting to get her second dose of the vaccine)

My mom has constantly denounced conspiracy theories, spoke out against Trump many times. This has caused her to loose friendships, have people stop talking to her, and one even said ‚Äúpeople in leadership roles shouldn‚Äôt be political‚Äù which led my mom to resigning from her job at a church. This church also has a far-right nationalist pastor who believes we aren‚Äôt going to be able to worship soon (because a catholic is going to take away Christians rights. Yeah, ok) I‚Äôve hear people at that church say that BLM protesters deserve to get covid, covid deaths are fake, nobody has died, and all you can imagine. Now onto my family...

My extended family on my mother‚Äôs side is a different story. Most are very anti-government conspiracy theorist. I went to eat breakfast with my cousins about 2 weeks ago and what I heard made me want to cry. Two of my cousins said that Covid was planned by the Government (because all 195 countries decided it was a good idea to release a deadly disease that‚Äôs killed over millions? Okay...) and they truly believe in Pizza gate, 9/11 was planned, and that all Democrat ran cities are hell on earth. My great uncle even posted an article at the church I (formerly) went to saying our Mayor is a liberal and she wants to take our guns. Many of them don‚Äôt want to take the vaccine (because they believe a Facebook troll over scientists who‚Äôve been doing their jobs for 20+ years) they listen to OANN, Fox, any new source that worships Trump as their savior. 

I also talked about how the world thinks we are insane (very understandable) after they saw the terrorist attack on the capitol. My cousin said ‚Äúwell they also saw BLM and antifa...‚Äù and it hit me. The capitol invasion is what they‚Äôve wanted. All the clues have added up, saying they were going to buy AR-15s because ‚ÄúIn Joe Biden‚Äôs America they‚Äôll be taken away‚Äù Ever since then it‚Äôs been a constant struggle with them.
 
My dads parents are also going down the rabbit hole, they watch OANN, Fox, they think CNN is the devils way of speaking to America. My grandfather thought it was unfair because it wasn‚Äôt his age groups turn to get the vaccine (patience grandpa, patience) and it‚Äôs become very clear they can‚Äôt snap out of it.

I‚Äôve always been told family first, and usually these things have never affected me in any bad way, I would just say ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù and go on. But after those past year watching our politics go in a wacky direction, I can‚Äôt look past my family and family friends believing these things. Am I the bad one for not wanting to be around them, possibly even cutting them off?",QAnonCasualties
102,"All right, WTF are reptilian shapeshifters?","Ever since my mom went full Q, I've unfortunately had to try to keep up with their lunatic theories just I know what level of craziness to expect during our phone calls. This week, my sister, who had no idea, went to a funeral with our mom and her cousin, and called me immediately after to express concern over our mom's mental health. She said they were talking about how President Biden is actually dead, his clone is running things and the reptilian shapeshifters are taking over. I just said well, it's QAnon crap and she, and I'm so jealous of this, didn't know what that was so I had to explain it.

104,A shabby-chic decor blog I used to love turned Qulty,"There was a time that my broke ass thought about living in a tiny house, and I like shabby-chic decorating.  I found a lady who had a tiny house built, and she decorated it so cutely.  She even had cute outbuildings done in the same manner.  Her holiday and seasonal decorating was adorable.  Those pics were so lovely.

Then she started posting a lot of stuff praising god and being anti-vax for her dogs, blaming vaccines for her beloved dog getting cancer.  I thought, ""OK, she's really hurting right now, and she has no SO or kids, and this is her way of coping,"" so I kept reading.

Then she moved from the PNW to the southeast.  She said that god led her there.  She bought a cute little house and started decorating that too.  But she spike so disparagingly about the west coast where she grew up, and it started seeping into all of her posts, as well as the religious stuff.  She didn't know anyone where she had bought her house, so that must have been very isolating for her.

Then Trump got elected, and things really started changing.  She started decorating alongside Trump signs, and verbally got into it with people who asked her to not be so in-your-face about it.  She changed her bio to be even nastier, telling people who were only there for home decorating to ""move along"", because her blog was a safe space for conservatives.  At this point, none of the home decorating blog posts were Trump or Q free, and for every 1 home decor post there was one about how she praises god for electing Trump and ""saving the country"".  I stopped regularly reading after that.  The last post is from January 3rd, praying that Pence wouldn't certify the election results because ""no one she knows voted for Biden,"" so she is sure the election was stolen.

Now, I didn't know this person personally, but her early posts helped me through a time when I was afraid of being homeless with my kid.  The pictures were so beautiful, and I still look at them from time to time.  But I'm a little sad at how far she has fallen.  She went from an earthy crunchy cool chick to a Qultist.  How many peopke have turned away from her business because of her rants and general disagreeable behavior?  How much more is she isolating herself?  It's so sad to see the downward spiral right there in print.",QAnonCasualties
105,4 Simple questions- please answer,[removed],QAnonCasualties
106,I'm tired of being less important than Q.,"My parents are right wing (dad more so than mom) and so is my boyfriend. My boyfriend actually was semi-recently committed to a mental hospital because he is OBSESSED with Q.

I really need to end it with my boyfriend because Q is more important to him than I am (we've been together for almost 4 years).  He was normal before, albeit still very into politics, but it was normal. We could have normal conversations and I loved listening to him talk about his interests (he was trying to teach me about stocks before he was committed). Politics never mattered to our relationship, as we believe vastly different things. Towards the end, he couldn't sleep. He was obsessed with the pizzagate thing, and he kept talking to my mom about it. My mom didn't believe it (thank god) but she got him onto that belief that Trump is a time traveler that's come to save us and that the world is flat and all that jazz. I am so mad that she got that into his head, as he was already struggling. That's the part that really pushed him over the edge.

Supposedly he was following people and forcing them to listen to his Q rhetoric as he thought he was saving them. I know for certain he went MIA for a few days and then they found him in the streets, crying and covered in his own feces/vomit. It pains me to think of him like that, as he is normally such a strong person. He (like me) has some serious mental health conditions.

When he was in the hospital and we'd talk nearly everyday over the phone, he seemed normal. He told me he loved me for the first time in months, and I felt like he was getting better. He's been out for a while and he's been weaned off his meds and he's finally starting to feel more like himself again, but now he's on me because masks don't work and the pandemic is a hoax and whatnot.

He hasn't told me he's loved me since, and I am just very, very tired of him loving politics and Q more than he loves me. I want to break up with him, but I don't know how as I've never had to do so before and I still want him in my life because he's normally such a nice, sweet guy. If he could just give up Q, that would be good, but he's too far in. I don't really have hope for it.",QAnonCasualties

109,"Not sure my relationship with my anti-vax, girlfriend is worth saving anymore, seems she went of the deep end into Q territory","I've been with her close to 4 years. I found out she was anti-vax shortly into our relationship. At the time, I didn't think too much into it. I'm one who always believes it's her body, her choice when it comes to what she does to herself.  She has always been a heathy eater and earthy hippie type when it comes to diets, which I though was always a positive thing. About a year into our relationship she was diagnosed with lyme disease. After the diagnosis, she started getting into a bunch of pseudoscience healing, such as muscle testing,  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, rife machine frequency treatment, crystal healing and such. Bought dozens if not hundreds of natural supplements, bouncing around to 6 or 7 different doctors's some of them real, and some natural. Some of the real doctors didn't think she had lyme at all, but that is a discussion for a different day. I always supported her on her decision of treatment. Then covid hit and she started becoming even a little more extreme with her views. She started believing that masks do more harm than good. She believes now that Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci are evil and trying to decrease the population an whatnot. I¬†feel that her facebook antivax groups were her gateway drug to looney tunes land.
 
Now the other night I brought up the fact that it looks like covid cases are going down. She blurted out ""yeah they won their election with this bullcrap, now let us get back to normal"". I was a little shocked. I was like, ""wait a minute, do you really belive that?"". She said, ""yep, covid is fake"". She's always despised trump during his presidency, so we had that in common. Latley, when she hears of someone getting  the vaccine, she goes into rants about how stupid they are for not doing their ""research"". Almost everything is now a conspiracy theory with her. She has even started to believe the government is controlling the weather and the recent cold wave was caused by them. She has become a very negative minded with just about everything lately. Any conversation is quickly flipped to something negative. It's gotten to the point that it's affecting my mental health. I just can't understand how she could become so brainwashed from random people she doesn't know on the internet, and take what they say as fact. She tells me I am the one who is brainwashed. I feel our relationship my be coming to an end very soon, and there isn't any way of saving it at this point.",QAnonCasualties
110,"Is It Your WHOLE Family, Too? Or Am I The Only One?","The only person I have in my life right now who doesn't buy into this Q stuff is my SO.  I'm starting to feel like our safety (just from Covid-paranoia and their Anti-Masking ways alone) is in question.  

My mother has used my mental health vulnerability against me before and she attempted to do so again in 2020.  I am just recently learning what a boundary is in my 30's.  Because I set a boundary, she started telling family I was ""losing my mind again.""  I'm literally just chillin, home-schoolin and having anxiety like the majority of the country- I'm not doing anything wrong or different except I am seeing a therapist and setting boundaries.  My weight- which has been the same exact weight for eight years sans the fluctuation from bloating- was suddenly being dragged into question.  If they can claim my disordered eating is flaring up again, then they can claim I'm getting ""crazy"" again.  This is starting to feel like some FreeBritney shit in my own life.  Except lucky me, I'm poor so nobody wants to use me for that lol.  My mother was infuriated I wouldn't open my door for her and then sent every other family member for me.  I had more invitations to outings and unannounced drop-bys by family members in 2020 than all other years of my adulthood combined.  I learned how to say no but I'm still not leveled up enough yet to not include reasons.  I was accused of ""isolating myself"" by every single family member.  In a global pandemic.  When we're supposed to be staying at home.  It's absurd but my sense of humor is drifting away from me, and I have to keep a strong connection to that because that has been a vehicle for my ability to remain calm and stable throughout this past year.  And I tell you what, when you're the ""crazy one"" of your family, watching your whole family Folie a'Deux in front of your eyes over a period of years.... Yeah I've had enough taking stress hormones because of them.  I have to get away from this because it is no joke, wrecking my body.  

I don't know how to do this.  My therapist even seems on the bandwagon as I've heard Antifa come out of his mouth at least thrice over the period of a year.  Apparently I live in a rural pocket of dysfunction and I have to lay low and strategically pull myself out of this situation.  I just need to get to vaccinations without catching the Rona.  I'm no longer worried about changing anyone's minds.  I'm about protecting my immediate family from this craziness.  Just yesterday, my mother was spouting bullshit about how we already caught Rona last year in this time (when I'd attempted my first boundary with her in asking she do not come to our house sick, she did anyway then went on to say we caught it, too.  We did not and we were not sick at all in 2020.) and when I said that immunities only last for 6 months, she called it all bullshit.  My grandmother, who will die a terrible drawn out death if she catches the Rona, is being cared for by my mother.  I have absorbed nothing but fucking Cortisol for the entirety of 2020 because of the fears I have of losing these people and also the fears I have of losing my own life or ability to walk or talk because they can't respect my wishes.  My doctor told me flat out not to catch Rona because I'm already having neuropathy symptoms (which are obvious to see) and we haven't figured out the root causes as to why.  I've explained this to everyone I know.  Mother, siblings, grandparent, uncles/aunts and cousins, too.  One would think that would lead to an understanding.  Of course not.  My life can never be just problem to solution then solved.  No wonder why I have crippling anxiety.  I'd have to be a psychopath to not be freaking out atm.

I'm so exhausted and I reached a breaking point last month where something got shut off in me.  I am no longer willing to help them, I'm no longer open to hearing their sob stories, I'm no longer able to share my life or struggles with them.  The only thing stopping me from changing my number and cutting them off completely are the younglings that are in tow and my urge to be the best influence to them I can muster.  


Please just could someone else- even if you have to lie, tell me I'm not the only one who's losing everyone they knew and loved to Q. 
 I don't think I can handle feeling this alone in the world today. 
 Thank you if you read this all.

Edit- Thank you for all of the support and I will be meeting with my therapist within the week and moving on.  Someone gave me great advice of taking seven different people's input on any one given subject and I love that and will be taking that with me wherever I go.  Good luck everyone dealing with the terrifying situation we have at hand and I hope everyone has a wonderful and um, stress-free as possible weekend.",QAnonCasualties

112,Q Adjacent Mom vent,"To start things off let me just both of my parents used to be semi-normal reaganesque conservatives until the 2016 elections when they got heavily into the right wjng podcast circle. She is someone who is curious about Q and I'm terrified she will fall further into it. She believes that BLM is connected to a global communist and islamic cabal funded by China, last summer was really my breaking point. I kept seeing all the police brutality that was so open and shameless and it bothered me alot and i visably mourned it. She constantly belittled and insulted me for questioning law enforcement and we got into plenty of yelling matches over whether the victims of police brutality ""deserved"" it or not.  For some context I'm a nearly 17 yo transgender girl and they have known for nearly 3 years now. They are incredibly antilgbt going along with all the boycotts and such. I'm so sick of the podcasts and fox news and oan blaring constantly. Hearing all those horrid things spouted out is hurtful and knowing my own mother subscribes to it hurts more. It is a constant struggle to live here and I hope I can get out soon because I feel like my mental health is getting worse the longer I stay here. Facts have no bearing on her whatsoever as this is also a religous thing for her and she has admitted no evidence could change her beliefs.",QAnonCasualties
113,My Qmom is now anti-vax,"Just when I think things couldn't get any worse my Qmom ended up ranting about how none of my family is going to get any of the vaccines because they have not been tested and how they contain baby fetuses and aluminum, she also did the typical ""do your research, I did mine"" quote so I think I've hit some kind of fucked up bingo by this point.

I am high risk and she is super high risk so getting a vaccine is not just a so I don't feel really bad for a while because I'm in the demographic of people who could likely die from it from what I understand. This has gone from sad to pathetic to outright endangering my life.

I'm only 17 so I can't go and get one by my self yet but I told her in 4 months once I turn 18 I am getting it. Then comes the typical arguments about how ""no your not its not safe"" and ""I'm only doing this to protect you""

The past six months have been a living hell to go through with my mom. She has a lot of bad medical issues she has been a bit or an odd ball but I never thought it would be conspiracy theorist then and anti Vax and every day it seems like their are new even more dangerous than the last things she believes. 

Meanwhile I'm terrified that she is going to have a second cardiac arrest and drop dead, the only reason she survived the first one was because I happen to be in the house in the other room, I even watched her die and be revived by paramedics. So I've got trauma, and paranoia to leave her alone all while having to deal with her loosing her mind more and more every day.

Im sorry for the rant I just really needed a place to vent.

Edit: things just got worse My mom called me into the living room to argue with me about how Bill gates, Anthony Faucci and George Sorrose created the covid virus in order to make money off the vaccine while depopulating the planet.

121,I Lost My Dad to Conspiracy Theories,"I don't use reddit much, but I heard of this subreddit and figured it may be a good outlet for me. Bear with me, this is gonna be kind of a rambly post with no real resolution. I just want to share my story.

For as long as I can remember, my dad has bought into conspiracy theories. He's a recovering addict (who doesn't believe in addiction) and he's on narcotics due to a back injury he sustained. His delusions somehow were exacerbated by this injury, he totally changed after it.

It started out kind of small and standard, when I was in elementary school he would warn me about the illuminati and make me watch bizarre youtube videos. That was tolerable, though. He was still a good dad. We would go out rock hunting in the Owyhees, or practice shooting together. On clear nights we'd star gaze and he'd point out constellations and planets, talk about the basic science behind them. It was silly, but at the time these bonding experiences with my father made me believe I could work at NASA. It was a childhood dream of mine.

When I hit 12, I started forming my own opinions, and unfortunately it caused issues. He became distant, but not outlandish. No, it wasn't until a few years later, 2016, that his mental stability seemed to totally collapse.

He started off by becoming a Flat Earther. My friends find it real funny, but it's honestly extremely sad. I'd try to get him to come look at the moon and stars with me and it would end with him screaming in my face about how none of it was real, and I was stupid for even thinking it was. He became a massive Trump supporter, essentially believed he was the messiah, and my father just dissolved into this hateful, bigotted, fearful shell of the man I used to know. 

He started to believe the military was going to storm the house and take his guns, he was constantly on edge about what big secrets the government was hiding, he was just sure Trump would bust that deep state pedo ring, other outlandish and bizarre stuff. He started watching alt-right youtubers and began mimicking their sentiments about the LGBTQ community being evil and unnatural and undeserving of life. I am a closeted transman and I know I can never come out for fear of my own safety. I'm scared of what my dad would do.

We don't rock hunt or star gaze anymore. The closest thing I can get to that is agreeing to help him pick up brass to reload for the impending apocalypse. Other than that, he takes off on his motorcycle for days at a time or just ignores his family. We stay quiet because we're scared of his delusion-filled blowups. Everyday I question how much further he's going to slip away from reality.

I don't really have a point, other than I really, really miss my dad. I hope maybe my story can provide some warning signs for others and help prevent their fathers from falling too far, too.

Honestly, all I want is to be able to stargaze with my dad again.",QAnonCasualties
122,Going Through Life As a University Student With a QAnon Mother,"Hi everyone, I'm only just recently finding these kind of recovery groups but I'm so glad I have. QAnon has taken over my mother's life and driven her to the point of being committed to a mental institution twice in less than a month. This has left me as basically the head of household for a house that I don't even live in and am 100+ miles away from. I've had to take in 3 cats, worry about bills being paid on the house and my 3 dogs that were taken to the pound following my mother's committal, plus the well-being and safety of my 14 year old sister who was made to move in with my father following an incident with my mother that made her get committed the first time, all on top of me being a double major in music and political science and taking 20 credit hours this semester. I'm trying my best to keep my head above water, but it's so hard when I don't even recognize my own mother anymore. She's diagnosed with manic bipolar depression, but QAnon has led her to believe that she no longer needs her medicine, causing her to lash out at others, specifically my sister. She's still in the hospital as we speak with no signs of improvement. My mom has been my best friend for so long and I miss her so much. It feels like I've not been able to have a normal conversation with her in over three months now. I just want my old mom back. I can't even watch my Snapchat memories anymore because there are so many videos of her and watching them just makes my heart hurt more. And I feel so terrible for my sister who is caught up in all of this as well. She's starting her freshman year of high school and has to do so completely remotely and from over sixty miles away because she's with my dad, who neither of us have a good relationship with anyway. It feels like I'm in a never-ending cycle of stress. I want to go home to visit my family like an normal college kid, but I can't because there's no one home anymore. I can't discuss this with anyone at school either because this is a pretty left-leaning institution and I feel like I won't be taken seriously if I do try to talk to any of my political science professors and address it as a valid concern.",QAnonCasualties

It's tragic to read the posts on here- it is a small comfort to know I'm not the only one who lost a loved one to a conspiracy about blood-drinking, child-trafficking lizard people.

My mother and her partner had been together since 2007- they met serendipitously after my dad passed. It was a pretty happy relationship for a long time; he was a pretty great dude, funny, and did wonders for my mom keeping up with the house and generally keeping her company. They decided to never marry (having both been married once before), but I felt that he really became part of our family, and he really cared for my sister and I. I moved away from my hometown for work, but felt better leaving knowing she had his companionship. It wasn't a seamless relationship, but it seemed to be what they both needed. At least for awhile.

The drifting apart was insidious at first. He spent gradually more and more time with his friends, and more and more time online. My mom's pretty liberal and he *was* apolitical. Rarely voted, stated he didn't give a shit about politics. But I think he spent too many hours with his really sketchy, racist, generally unpleasant friends, and got caught up. He actually tried to hide his Q browsing for awhile from my mom, knowing she would call him out on it, until he started showing her REALLY bizzare ""information"" and ""YouTube Truths"".

The family really imploded during quarantine. I did my best to give my love and support from afar and tried as hard as I could to play peacekeeper. The election was a big flashpoint for their relationship; LOTS of arguments about politics, and his friends even threatened my mom at times in her own home. My mom thought he'd chill the fuck out afterwards, but he just dove deeper and OBSESSED over the election, the ""cabal"", Bill Gates, all sort of ridiculous nonsense.... And he didn't even vote in the election!

A part of me is a little relieved my mom is out of a relationship she had grown really unhappy with- and I think she's safer away from his friends- but it's truly heartbreaking to see her experience this loss (and not be able to travel to at least give her a hug)...

I'm still Facebook friends with him (albeit I'm not on as much these days). He constantly shares garbage misinformation, particularly with respect to the pandemic, vaccines, and severity of coronavirus.. for me, that's the deepest cut. He would rather believe information from randos and memes on facebook than me............ and I'M A GODDAMN MD.

Thanks for reading and acting as a conduit for my  internet venting. If my sister stumbles across  this: don't show mom (miss you guys a fuckton, even that asshole rooster).",QAnonCasualties

She always talks about how I‚Äôm ‚Äúasleep‚Äù and is trying to ‚Äúwake {me} up.‚Äù Over the years, we have just had to agree to disagree and stop conversations when they start getting heated because we cannot coexist in a room much less on this planet if she brings her conspiracy theory bull shit into the conversations. Our conversations over the years have often ended in yelling, crying, screaming, or fleeing from the scene altogether because of QAnon so she‚Äôs learning to shut her mouth. 

Stuff inevitably still comes up now and then, but we try to nip it in the bud when it does. Today, she calls me freaking out about how she met her ‚Äúheroes‚Äù Sidney Powell (Trumpie lawyer) and Michael Flynn (Former very much failed US National Security Advisor). She said she asked them about if the child pedophilia is really as bad as she thinks it is, and they said, ‚Äúeven worse.‚Äù She talked to them for 10 minutes, and essentially, I‚Äôm so worried the pushed her so much further back into her culty ways and that things are about to get worse. 

I honestly didn‚Äôt know how to react to her and just said, ‚Äúglad you‚Äôre happy‚Äù, and other general BS like that to avoid arguing, but, truthfully, I‚Äôm so scared that she will regress even more and just be more validated over her conversations with them.

130,Therapist might be into QAnon/Qadjacent,"I've had the same therapist for several years, and usually he's great. But we had a telehealth therapy session a few days ago that left me feeling uneasy.

We hadn't spoken in a few months, so I brought up how freaked out I was about the Capitol riot. He downplayed it, and said he had read things online that made him doubt what really happened.

First he said that simple protestors couldn't have broken the ""bulletproof"" glass windows of the Capitol, implying the photos clearly showing protestors breaking windows were fake somehow. 

Quick aside, they are not and never were bulletproof.

The second thing he claimed was that a lot of the rioters photographed in the Capitol doing destructive things had hammer and sickle tattoos. When I told him I highly doubted the far right guys would have Communist tats, he said, ""Well, that's the point. Then they were on the other side."" 

You know, because a whole bunch of Communist agent provocateurs who are trying to frame the right all tattoo their allegiance in easily visible places and forget to cover it up.

I changed the subject after he told me it was just stuff he read and I should look it up myself. Looking it up myself showed me both these insane ideas are being promulgated by the conspiracy theory crowd.

I have friends and family members that have gotten into all this, but I don't know if their experiences are shared by others (although of course everyone is unique in some way).

What I've seen with my friends/family:

\- They have always tended to believe that there are evil, left-wing elites out to get us. QAnon gave them an outlet for this belief and fanned it even more.

\- They trusted someone (a friend, authority figure \*cough cough\*) who believed, and this pulled them in as well.

134,Next week? Any word on real actions?,"like many of you, I have heard all the theories about March 4th. Trump is coming back, rounding up the pedophiles, military take over, the Storm, civil war, etc etc.  However, has anyone heard of any actual plans? Jan 6 th, Trump used Twitter to bring people out for his rally and it went from there. There was something put out beyond Qanon message boards.

But March 4th? While the police in Washington DC are preparing for the worst, other than rumors and stories Qcumbers tell each other, is there any planned gathering or protest? I have not heard anything on those lines. At least not in the capital. My state capital has a protest most weekends, so something at our capital on the 4th is probably already scheduled. Probably a protest protecting squirrels or a protest march against the governor for his bad haircut. But I don't live in a red Trump is the Savior state. 

If this weekend at his speech Trump says or suggests something, well that is possible. But Trump isn't Q. They may worship him, but he uses them like a disposal wipe. It just seems there should be some hard plans if they actually are going to do something. Unless trump is suppose to do it all himself",QAnonCasualties

139,Q drops versus the Q drips,"So this whole Qanon thing has cost me the friendship of a couple that I've known as friends since 2011 or so, a good ten years. Great people, lots of fun, professionals, etc. Never any heated political discussions. I am fairly middle politically and would consider him just a little right of center for all the years I have known him.

What I call the Q Drip, began over the last year, when political things were dropped into normal everyday situations for absolutely no reason.

Things like, "" If Biden gets elected he'll appoint all Blacks to his Cabinet."" Heard this the first time and said "" What'd you just say? He repeats it and says this will happen and we will be a socialist/marxist country. I'm like why would you say that? No reasonable answer, just a wait you'll see. Obviously doesn't come true, utter nonsense. We were riding bikes and out for ice cream as couples at the time on a gorgeous summer day. WTF.

Months before that he meets some other friends of mine for the first time in March of 2020 and goes on a rant about how the coronavirus is just the flu, it's all made up by the democrats to oust Trump, etc, etc, etc. Very embarrassing for me. Never heard this shit before from him.  I'm like you just met these people, maybe get to know them, ask some questions about them, etc. I get him data on flu deaths verus coronavirus deaths and all the bullshit arguments begin. He's not scared of it, blah, blah, blah. It's inflated to turn us into drones.

Then we get together for my birthday one night in late August with them and another couple, drinks, nice outdoor fire, etc. Good social distance and everything. I'm thinking we'll have a nice time together. Within 5 minutes it turns into a Covid bitchfest. The governor is an ass, this college closed, that high school shut down, with of course nonstop criticism of every organizational body that has to deal with the virus. Non stop criticism. Again I'm like WTF and what would you do smartypants?!?! No answers of course.

The night devolves into more full on Qanon comments and perspective. The coronavirus will go away the day after the election, just you wait and see. I'm like so people across a country are going to fill in ballots, vote, the ballots will be counted and this will make a virus that has penetrated the WORLD population go away? The virus is in other countries too did you know that? Doesn't matter what I say, as logical as I am it makes no dent. A made up virus by the Democrats to get rid of Trump, you just wait and see. ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED.

This turns into more stuff like hydroxychloroquine, BIG PHARMA doesn't want it to work because they won't make any money. I say, ""So all the doctors and hospitals have to be in on it too to then because they want to make more money? You don't think there are any doctors out there who care about the health and safety of their patients?"" If it worked I'm sure we all would be relieved and happy. But it doesn't. Well of course all the doctors and hospitals are in on it too.

There is more of course that night, the pedophile democrats, fake hospital deaths, masks are the worst infringement on our personal freedoms,, the Deep State, etc. This being uttered all the time. I finally GO OFF. Known them over 10 years, never done anything like it and I let them HAVE IT. Felt good and felt bad all at the same time.

It is now 6 months later and we haven't spoken. Found a text from his wife to my wife talking about the 1619 project and how that is destroying our schools across the USA. They haven't changed and aren't going to anytime soon. Think I just need to let them go.

The Q drip is a common tactic  that many of us have experienced and I said/yelled/screamed  ""You are not doing this to me anymore!""

Does it matter? Will they change? I don't know. But I was not going to be the nice guy and ease them back. I said enough is enough. I feel horrible about it, but I just want sane, rational, clear thinking people in my life who are willing to look at something, break it down and examine what is really happening. Then look to empirical evidence for support. Is that too much to ask?",QAnonCasualties

He threw some fishing rods I had at his house in his front yard and told me to pick them up or they would be stolen. He has been a friend since seventh grade (we are 43yo) and each time a democrat is elected to office he stops talking to me for at least a year or two. The ups and downs have me worn out.

I saw a gentile, kind, loving man become hateful, violent, and unavailable unless I believed what was discussed on the show. I equated it to him becoming someone that plays violent video games. I had to move out of our home about 2 weeks after he pushed me to the ground twice. Our house was filled with the repeated playing of the THI podcasts. Our relationship ended forever after he physically beat me when I felt he was not listening to my concerns. He has taken a plea in his DV charge. I have reached out the Thomas Williams that runs the show and his responses have been less than hopeful. My Ex had been in a cult before which I felt made him a good candidate for believing in Q info. He was always someone that looked at alternative information and for a long time practiced yoga, meditation, and looks at more positive groups looking at the good of all people and how to be a good person. The day he started listening to the THI show is the day our relationship changed. I lost someone I saw myself getting old with. This is some scary stuff and I‚Äôm so happy this group is here.

I've been fighting against qanon since I learned about them during ##SAVEOURCHILDREN. Qanon decided to use the suffering of children to recruit new victims. This movement claimed to be the voices of silenced children...like me. Qanon is not my voice.
 Qanon spread false conspiracy theories about child sex trafficking that distracts from actual child sex trafficking. They also claimed that trump was going to save us all from the evil democrat lizard pedophiles....when in reality trump has Epstein accusations. He was accused of sodomizing a 12 and 13yo at an epstien party in 1994. There were 2 witnesses and the 12year old was proven kidnapped...not only that but even Maxwell herself was recently quoted mentioning videos of both Clinton and Trump with girls. So  qanon spread a movement that pushes a suspected Epstein pedophile as a hero, while silencing the stories of Epstein victims. The silencing of victims being disguised as the voices of victims is certainly triggering to me. I was mentioned in a news article  after my outcries over qanon caught the attention of a journalist. Every time I spoke out about it online I got shamed and even threatened. Once the article came out I got death threats.

Sure we've had our differences but it's nothing we haven't been able to reconcile about.  At certain points of my life I would probably call him my best friend.

But recently that relationship has been upended by Q. I first got a glimpse when Trump came down those golden escalators and started spewing hateful things about Mexicans. My parents lapped it up, and that's because spoiler alert: we're Mexican! It was all downhill after that. Hilary this, Comey that, Obama yadda yadda. Trump getting elected is what made me start paying attention to politics and now I try to volunteer where I can.

Things we're OK between us during the Trump admin, but things really ramped up after the election. Voter Fraud, Military Take Over, The Storm, Blah Blah. Honestly I was pretty frazzled by this point. During this time I tried avoiding divisive topics (which just seems to keep expanding) but somehow we still circle back to Trump or Biden. 

I look at my dad today and I hardly recognize him, he is just so hateful now. He calls me a socialist and says I hate Trump and think all Trump supporters are racists.

I'm so glad i found this sub. this is long, and i apologize for that, but i've been holding this in and need to get it out. 

two of my friends are incredibly intelligent doctoral candidates. they're kind, caring, and some of the smartest people i know. at least they were, i guess. at the beginning of trump's presidential run they insisted that even though they both are republicans, they weren't going to vote for him and that they didn't agree with him on a lot of policies. over time, they've both turned into something that i don't recognize. every time i try and talk to them, it somehow comes back to Q. it's absolute lunacy. they're insistent that I'm part of the enemy because i voted democrat, that a second civil war will break out, that i should be arming myself for when antifa will raid our republican-controlled city and round everyone who voted red up and deport them. my female friend is stockpiling canned food, shelf milk, bottled water, and other non-perishable items for when this antifa raid happens and she needs to hide from them, enough to last her for a few months. apparently, the trump followers and Q believers will be rounded up and shipped to concentration camps. my male friend is thoroughly convinced that every single American who voted in the election actually voted for trump, but dominion voting along with the ""deep state"" changed the 81 million votes biden won. he claims that i made hundreds of copies of my ballot and sent those in with dead peoples' names attached instead of mine. he calls Q drops and the videos from top Q believers on youtube the ""new Bible"" and tells me to throw my copies of the ""old"" one away. they both watched the insurrection on the capital like it was the stanley cup final. I've tried to reason with both of them, show them that none of this is true, but they won't believe me. it's gotten to the point that they won't even let me over for dinner and don't want to see me anymore because they don't want to associate with the enemy.

It wasn‚Äôt until I got to high school and met some really positive, wonderful people that I realized that not everything was doom and gloom. Not everything had to do with politics and the liberals weren‚Äôt out to string us by our toes.

This was also about the same time I discovered I was gay. I was really afraid to come out to my dad, who I had figured out was an insane conspiracy theorist by that time, but I hoped he would still be proud of me. After all, I was still the same person. I was still his little girl.

Evidently not.

His tirades had no end. He believed that I was ‚Äútoo far gone‚Äù and that my ‚Äúliberal school‚Äù had converted me. He pulled my little sister out of her own school and put her in a christian online school called Freedom Academy. I could tell that I was starting to loose her, and we argued so often we were barely on speaking terms. I couldn‚Äôt take the mental abuse anymore, so I left. I‚Äôm glad that I did, but it seems that quarantine has made his attitude so, so much worse.

I‚Äôm writing this because I called him the other day, trying to get an update on my twin sisters that were born last October. He gave me two seconds of peace, and I honestly believed he wasn‚Äôt going to talk about it, before he started to argue with me about the pandemic again, calling face masks ‚Äúscare tactics‚Äù and the quarantine organized ‚Äúso the liberals could kick Trump out of office‚Äù because OBVIOUSLY he‚Äôs the best President we‚Äôve ever had. 

He was angry at why I hadn‚Äôt already come out to visit him, even though none of them take precautions and I don‚Äôt feel like endangering my new family with COVID. He started accusing me of not loving my family, of being selfish and psycho because I didn‚Äôt agree with him and his batshit, deep state views.

I‚Äôm so tired, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to go see him this summer, if only to meet my new sisters, but I‚Äôm at a loss. He‚Äôs always been very persuasive and manipulative so I‚Äôm worried that if I go he might hold my siblings over my head and force me to stay. Cutting him off isn‚Äôt an option, either, because I‚Äôd lose all contact with my siblings and extended family.

159,Lost my Brother and Dad,"I have always had a strained relationship with my Brother and Dad my whole life and I‚Äôm in my mid 40‚Äôs.  Things took a turn when my Mum died in 2016 and then the Trump and Q rhetoric heated up in 2017.  Things got really bad. 

It got to the point where I couldn‚Äôt have a discussion with them, because it devolved into politics so they could inform me about being fed lies by fake news, pedo socialists and commies.  They are consuming right wing media all the time.  I was told Trump was a good man.  Trump didn‚Äôt lose the election, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see‚Äù, which i will assume was referring to the failed coup.

The straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was when I sent a link to my father that seemed logical and had succinct arguments and accurate evidence which I thought give him for for thought.  He replied with ‚ÄúCNN is crying‚Äù and other nonsense.  What I sent him wasn‚Äôt even related to CNN, but that was his go to.

160,A Powerful Argument Against Q (and all other conspiracy theories),"Because of the cult-like grip Q has on people you cannot talk them out of it directly.  You have to plant seeds of doubt and hope they take root and grow.  I recently learned about one of these seeds.  It is about the moon landing, but you can pivot it to Q.

Based upon the actual footage documenting the moon landing it is estimated that 400,000 people would have to be colluding on the conspiracy.  NONE of these alleged co-conspirators came forward since.  That is completely unrealistic.  We all know how hard it is for any group to keep anything secret for long, to have so many non-military personnel and corporations participating it would be absolutely impossible.

So, how many people would have to collude in a Q-like set of conspiracies?  Because it is not just one conspiracy, but several (election fraud, baby-eating, vaccinations, etc), a huge number of people would have to be involved.

Example: so where are the parents of ANY child that was supposedly stolen and eaten?  Why didn‚Äôt the parents file a missing child report?  Why didn‚Äôt the school?  Grandparents?  Immediate family?  

To believe Q you are assuming that parents and immediate family, police, child services, missing child CHARITIES, religious organizations who help children, services people who would be responsible for preparing the dead children to be eaten (because the rich don‚Äôt cook for themselves), and more would have to be actively complicit in keeping this secret IN ADDITION to the government.  This would be thousands of thousands of people worldwide in addition to the rich people running it all.

This argument is given strength by stating that people cannot even plan a surprise party easily.  Humans are not good at keeping secrets.

Try to add this to the arsenal of truths that you can use.  I hope it helps.",QAnonCasualties
161,Had a HUGE fight with my sister yesterday,"My sister, who has been poking and poking me, trying to get a reaction, but I've been holding back. I finally couldn't stand it when, yesterday, she texted me some of her ""data"" and started going on about all the evidence of thousands of deaths and permenant injury people are experiencing from taking the Covid vaccine.

I blew up and answered her sharply. It went back and forth. She had the nerve to tell me that she was telling me all this in order to be able to say I told you so after I get my vaccine and, probably, die.

I told her I'm done and took myself off of our family group chat.

She promptly texted me privately and called me a typical Democrat who can't have an argument with the facts (I'm a Republican, as she knows). Then she called me a hypocrite.

I sent her a long voice note with barely restrained anger, telling her that the issues isn't whether she or I are correct about the vaccine. It's about her disrespect and overstepping boundaries by not allowing me to have my own opinions.

She had the gall to say this was all about her being concerned for me and how much she loves me and doesn't want to lose me, blah, blah, vomit.

When I calmed down later, I was able to think more clearly. I knew this ""concern"" for my health wasn't right somehow but couldn't figure out why right then. Now I know what it's about. This isn't about concern for my health or an over abundance of sisterly love. This is plain and simple EGO. She can't accept that I don't agree with her ""health data"". She has to push and push and push until I give in and agree. The proof is that comment about needing to be able to say I told you so. 

There's probably a big dose of hidden uncertainty in her beliefs as well, since she needs my approval so badly.

Understanding this makes me feel a little better but that fight was super unpleasant and I had a terrible headache for the rest of the day.

Of course this conspiracy dates back 5 years ago when claims were made rovers were staged and photos taken on Devon island in Canada. I blame this absurd belief on Q because my family once fully believed the rover missions were legitimate and were fascinated with the missions! It wasn't till after they became cult followers of Q they flipped and now literally believe every little conspiracy on the internet regardless of whether or not it has any backing of evidence solely because it's something they hope/want to be true.

When this claim regarding perseverance was made I blatantly replied ""That's about the most STUPID thing I've heard you say thus far! You really need to use your brain and STOP believing these bullshit conspiracies you read on the internet because not everything on the net is true just because you want it to be true!""

Here is the article I posted earlier again for context: [Can Cult Studies Offer Help With QAnon? The Science Is Thin.](https://undark.org/2021/02/24/cult-studies-qanon/)

 She said that complaining about Qanon and its believers is an overly 'woke' thing.\* It really pissed me off. The Qanons are abusive and toxic. I told her that this is tearing families apart and she disregarded it. She disregarded thousands of people's experiences with this nonsense. 

She claims the article proves that brainwashing isn't a real thing, which the article does address, but didn't mention that psychologists cited in the article believe that maybe these people just might be doing this all on their own. They do it by their own agency which is more disturbing. Qanons choose to be jerks.

My ex best friend, who I was friends with for 18 years, thinks ANTIFA is going to storm her family‚Äôs home. 

We grew up together, and in the last year she has had told me her darkest thoughts of suicide. As the elections came closer, she became more paranoid that BLM and communists were going to storm her suburban family home. Yet, she went to attend a Trump rally a few nights before the election, and was an active member of the Walk Away Campaign. 

Once Biden won the election, she was convinced Trump was not going to leave the White House. Yet, she continued to also threaten suicide and eventually, my self and another friend who works in mental health care got her to commit into an outpatient program for depression. She also has an addiction to alcohol and LSD. 

Now she believes that neo-Nazis don‚Äôt exist (???), that it was wrong for her to join an outpatient depression program, and that children are being trafficked by Hollywood.there were many other deep personally problems going on, so we stopped being friends. She got angry at me for not believing any of this, and then gaslighted me. 

I recently listened to a podcast talking about QAnon and it hit me... I think my friend is part of QAnon. I never put two and two together because I was more concerned about her suicidal intentions. I‚Äôve tried everything I can, as well as her closets friends. Her family also follows QAnon, so they don‚Äôt think she has any mental health issues. Her brother is the worst too, because he wears his MAGA hat on social media.

191,Accepting that this wasn‚Äôt out of the blue,"&amp;#x200B;

Thank you everyone in this community for your bravery and support.

My parents have gotten to the point of stopping their local newspaper to subscribe to Epoch Times, my mom has joined the local Republican women‚Äôs group after never joining anything of that nature before and leaving their old church because they were ‚Äútoo liberal‚Äù on social justice. It seems most local Republican chapters in predominantly white areas wholeheartedly still embrace Trump and all the conspiracy theories that go along with it. My dad recently sent me the Mike Lindell ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù as his great example of election fraud and has sent me Gateway Pundit links.

In the lead up to the election, I really struggled with accepting my parents‚Äô about face on Trump and acceptance of more bizarre claims. I thought about ways to convince them how terrible he was and thought there was some magic that could ‚Äúsave‚Äù them. We had a big fight after I decided to not visit them for Christmas due to them not taking proper COVID precautions. But after a lot of soul searching, I realized that this was a later stop on a decades long journey outside of the mainstream.

My parents‚Äô personalities can be vindictive and negative. I think that has roots in mental health issues but has left them ripe to embracing certain religious ideologies that lean into perceived persecution. These leaders use charged, emotional, and fear filled propaganda almost identical to right wing secular media. It aligns with the worst parts of loving, honest people. 

My parents haven‚Äôt evolved with the times. Leaders like Franklin Graham and James Dobson, although always fringe didn‚Äôt seem nearly as much so when I grew up in the 90s. Society continued to evolve and gain new understanding, but my parents kept following the same leaders who refused to update their views on claimed ‚Äúreligious principle‚Äù. It fed right into the perceived persecution narrative and when that is your frame of mind, it is easy to find a scapegoat.

Evangelical beliefs leave people really open to believing these types of wild ideas in other aspects of their life. Religion became a larger part of my parents‚Äô life over time and along with that wilder ideas about creationism, distrust of science, distrust of the same educational institutions they went to, etc.

So, having a leader like Trump only tapped into an existing network of fringe beliefs and gave them the ultimate platform.  You could previously laugh or shrug off these ideals because they weren‚Äôt molding public policy or causing 10s of thousands of unnecessary deaths from people not taking covid seriously.  Many religious sects have given bigotry a cover in the US for a long time and I think we‚Äôre at the breaking point of what that results in.

195,Dad told me days after the election Democrats were gonna put him in a concentration camp. We've barely talked since.,"I'm glad this group exists. Due to the pandemic I had to move in with my family for the foreseeable future. This started almost a year ago. My dad is a hardcore Trumper and after a month or two of being home I gave up engaging him. Every day leading up to the election he spent 2-6 hours online researching the election or talking to my friends and family members who were Pro-Trump. The conversations were always full of sarcastic laughs and a lot of hate. He started to form a victim complex where anytime anything happened politically he started to act like he was being oppressed. We live in an 800k house which is a 2 min walk from the beach. And he retired at 58. 

2 days after the election we watched Trump's press conference where he said he believed the election was rigged. I asked him what he thought. He said Democrats fabricated 5-10 million ballots and that he was in a rush to move to a red state before ""Democrats put him in a concentration camp"". I walked out and I haven't been able to talk or look at him much since. I'm in a bind financially as I've started a new career but I'm trying to desperately to move out. Since the election he's cut back big time, but that conversation still lingers over me. And I don't know if it'll ever go away. Does anyone else feel similar?",QAnonCasualties

[Can Cult Studies Offer Help With QAnon? The Science Is Thin.](https://undark.org/2021/02/24/cult-studies-qanon/)

I'm not surprised to see that cult deprogramming hasn't been found to be effective. My understanding is that controversial actions by concerned family and friends like surprise interventions for substance abuse and other actions such as kidnapping one's child for behavioral 'boot camps' are not necessarily helpful as well.\*  Kidnapping seems downright unethical as well.

This article is really interesting and a bit discouraging. Michael Schulson who has written in several high-profile publications about science and psychology contacted me after seeing a post I wrote asking about Qanon deprogramming. He now edits and writes for [Undark.org](https://undark.org/)  Undark is a non-profit, editorially independent digital magazine exploring the intersection of science and society. His articles for [undark.org](https://undark.org/)  can be found [here](https://undark.org/undark-author/michael-schulson/) and other articles he's written can be found [here.](https://michaelschulson.weebly.com/selected-samples.html)

EDIT: I should also mention that the discussion of brainwashing vs agency is interesting. I know there has been a lot of discussions, here and in other places about whether the recent political climate and conspiracy theories are just bringing out something that was already there: racism, abusiveness, and general unpleasantness. That's even more concerning in my opinion. They are actively choosing to be this way.

202,Q In-laws,"Hello Everyone,

New to this forum.  Looking for some advice. 

My in-laws have become q-obsessed and its causing challenges between my wife and them and my wife and I.  The background....  My in-laws retired early in 2008... big house on a lake... they were hit pretty substantially in the recession and I don't believe they've recovered.  They've since downsized to a smaller house.  At that time, my father-in-law pulled all his $ from the stock market at the bottom and started investing Gold, Silver, and other sketchy sounding investments.  They got caught up in the Iraqi Dinar scheme in the early 2010's and would bring a tupperware of Dinar to bury in our yard when they visited because you ""couldn't trust the banks"" and they needed access to it when it revalues... or whatever it was supposed to do.  I never really got involved and kind of just left it along.  At the beginning of Covid they brought boxes of freeze dried military foods for us... which I also thought was weird.  Then this fall we discovered they were Qanon followers.  It started when at their house when my brother-in-law pulled me aside and mentioned some weird child sex trafficking/Democrats beliefs they were telling him about (my b-in-law is a NRA loving conservative).  Again.. I largely stayed out of it.  The heat turned up when my m-in law was staying with us for a month watching our months old daughter.  Trump came up and I questioned how she could handle his horrible tweeting and terrible handling of covid.  Her response was a bit odd... ""you just wait"", and agreed you can't watch just foxnews... but then saying cause its too mainstream...  And also questioning if I was a BLM supporter... (which I don't actively support, but have no problems with it).  It was a bit contentious but overall the conversation was fine.  Basically, cause I don't support Trump I must be a liberal... not the case... just think he is terrible.   This next weekend, she attended a maskless Trump rally... which forced me to take two weeks of work to watch our daughter because of concerns about covid at the rally...  She apologized profusely and ""covid never crossed her mind"".  Long story short, they've continued to express all the Qanon beliefs to my brother-in-law, which he calls me about alarmed.  He's a strong right guy (who can acknowledge Trump is an ass) but that makes him safe to talk to for them.  I've send my wife data/podcast interviews. etc on how to deal with Qanon people... she gets upsets and doesn't want to think about it.  Her relationship with her parents is becoming a bit fake...call them to be nice and talk about their grandkids.  She's lamented she hasn't had a real conversation with her dad in months...  They are anti-mask, anti-covid, anti-covid vaccine.... it gets tough to talk to them when dealing with covid is a big part of my wife and I's jobs.  Seems like almost anything can draw a snide anit- establishment, media, etc remark.  We are getting concerneda about our elementary school kids being around them. We are thinking no more weekends at grandma and grandpas post covid...  Are we over-reacting?  Do we need to confront them?  My wife already did confront them about covid and the impact is has on our jobs and kid's schooling if we get exposed...They are honoring our wishes when they are around us, but following no guidelines on their own.",QAnonCasualties

209,"QAnon helped me realize a lifelong problem! Shocking, I know!","My siblings are deeply entrenched in QAnon conspiracies.  When my mother fell and was put in hospice last year, she contracted Covid.  The doctor mentioned hydroxychloroquine, but said in her case, it could kill her instantly.  I said no, we don't want it.  My mother was dying, and she had expressed she wanted nothing to keep her suffering going in her dying wishes to me.  My niece told me I was killing her.  My brother tried to get me to turn over my POA.  My mother had expressly stated she could not trust him to make decisions for her.  Once she passed, I've had very little contact with them.    
My brother started emailing me quite a bit about campers, real estate, and cars, all things I'm currently looking for.  No matter how much I told him I wasn't interested in the fixer-uppers, he continued to send them to me.  Then he sent me a link to a song that he said has been his favorite for some time.  Old America by Moccasin Creek.  I hated it.  I told him I didn't care for it at all.  He became hostile.  Told me I was full of bogus bs negativity.   Sent me a link from [gab.com](https://gab.com) about dead babies in tunnels underneath DC that Don Trump was involved in rescuing.  Didn't believe something I said, but believes this bs from [gab.com](https://gab.com).    
Then it hit me.  This has been his pattern our entire lives.  Disagree with him in any fashion, and he attacks.  My niece is the same way.  My sister just wisely drops the subject.  But my brother and niece just get really nasty if you don't look up to them and their opinions.  I've always wondered why I have such a hard time opening up to people.  It hit me like a wave washed over me.  It's because of them.  If i opened up about my feelings, I get attacked.

This is truly the most entitled generation in my opinion. It's just always more popular, at any time in history, to label the younger generations as entitled and lazy. I went to college and have worked for 30 years. Mom and MIL had no education and barely worked, I found real estate to be a popular occupation of their gender and generation. They were always around, not at the office 8 plus hours per day. The rest of us are suffering from trickle down economics. I miss the Greatest generation. There's no way most of them would buy into this nonsense. The ones that fought and had to deal with WWII. Out of all my extended family the Boomers have been the most financially secure,  been able to own large homes, have multiple homes, travel and retire early. I'm using the Greatest, Gen X and Millenial as the comparison. This Boomer generation has too much time on their hands and the ones minimally literate in a social media sense are the biggest Q offenders.

I know an aggressive and uneducated man, who is unfortunately tied to someone I care about. He's always been a dbag, but the Q stuff gave him new reasons to push people around. He is relentless in his violent opinions of any perceived liberals, frequently spouts ignorant and racist comments, and has yet to be held accountable for any of his abuses.

""Might be time to ask people if
 they're Republicans or Democrats
 and if they admit to being a
 Democrat kill them right then and
 there and go to their parents house
 and ask the same question.""

Oh, and when the state Capitol was boarded up after they received threats (following the 6th), he said ""I hope they burn that bitch down.""

They went right back to their small towns. They're still here among us, they're still angry, and they're still armed to the teeth. It feels like a matter of time before they rise up again.

I can't see this going any other way. Maybe you can?",QAnonCasualties
229,"Q-Anon checks the boxes for other types, not just conservatives","Conservative values definitely are represented in Q, emphasizing a rural attitude of distrust in government where they feel they are legally entitled to strike back at it if they don't like what they are seeing.

I listened to a podcast that actually brought up a good point though.  Q-Anon, in addition to being conservative, also has elements of mysticism, new age thinking and counter-culture.  What would be considered left-leaning and some former Obama voters have found themselves enthralled.  Some find Q talk meshes well with their talk of enlightenment.  Q fulfills former hippies need to feel as a group apart, participating in counter-culture movement.  

I personally find it disturbing that formerly free-love hippies(not all) would now actively engage as a group that desires to see enemies destroyed.  

I think people with a lack of emotional intelligence combined with a disinterest in fact finding and discernment ultimately are the most vulnerable.  Obviously that includes former left-leaning older voters.  'Boomers' getting lost in a volley of too much information coming at them at once.  When you understand the structure of government, you understand that these wild ideas of a storm could not even work on paper, much less in the real world.  Q supporters profess to love America, but they don't know the structure of government...they want a king, or fuhrer who ham-hands their crazy agenda and drives over their opposition.",QAnonCasualties

232,How slippery is the slope?,"I have some cousins who were not well educated and then went into the military. Came out with a very ‚Äúget your guns ready, they are after our white rights and our bibles!‚Äù mindset. 
I don‚Äôt mean to say that this happens to all low-education persons going into the military, I have nothing but gratitude for our troops and service members, and I‚Äôm proud of the service these two cousins have given. But, this is what has happened to my cousins. They went in one way, came out another way. They may have been highly susceptible to certain things they heard, to begin with. They had an evangelical, probably racist upbringing. 

Anyway they are not yet Q, as far as I can tell, but it sure is a slippery slope and I‚Äôm wondering if it is inevitable... 

They are obsessed with being transphobic. Like, someone asking to have certain pronouns used is taken as a complete infringement on THEIR rights, somehow. Obsessed with invalidating trans people. I learned this transphobia is a door to Q for some people. 
 They also absolutely hate the idea that anyone would talk about systemic racism or white privilege. This is hard because my own work is in correcting problems of systemic inequality. So I really don‚Äôt associate with them much anymore, it‚Äôs just too much. They really take me saying ‚Äúwe have systemic issues of racism that can be corrected if communities work together and change policy, legislation and culture‚Äù as me saying ‚Äúdown with the white man! You‚Äôre all evil! You all personally did this to our American system and I want to take your very rights away!‚Äù. It‚Äôs ridiculous. 

And of course the second amendment is their GOD. 

I just see them going further and further down this path, where they will not use common sense, where they feel victimized by any change that honors the reality of POC or trans people... and I feel like they are playing with fire. I leave them alone mostly but there are small children involved so I worry that they will go full Q. They are young men with their lives ahead of them. It‚Äôs very worrisome. And they are absolutely full of anger, anger that they are asked to consider that anyone who doesn‚Äôt look like them may have a different life experience and may have different needs. Anger that they can‚Äôt flaunt all their giant guns and be applauded for being gun-nuts everywhere they go. SO MUCH anger at Hillary Clinton for even EXISTING. And so much trump love still. 

So how slippery is the slope? If it walks like a Q and talks like a Q, but hasn‚Äôt openly claimed Q or any of the particularly insane conspiracies... is there a chance they will just stay where they are, idealogically? Where they are is NOT good, but for their children‚Äôs sake I do see it as better than full blown Q. 

To those losing closer family and friends to this, my heart aches for you. I don‚Äôt even see these guys very often, my concern for them is because I saw them grow up and I love them. But they aren‚Äôt impacting my daily life and before I close this post I just want to say, it still tears me up inside. So I can‚Äôt imagine having it even closer to home. My heart is with you that live with this insanity in the home, and I hope for all of you to find peace.",QAnonCasualties
233,Another Fractured Family thanks to Q,"Growing up, it was just me and my brother and my mom. Looking at family photo albums, I knew my dad had 2 kids from a previous marriage (half siblings), but we never met. Fast forward to 2006, and I get a call from my half sister. She found out about us after our dad died, and it was very exciting to have new family!

Everything was great. I flew out of state to visit them a few times. We would keep in touch by calling each other every few months. We had our differences (I'm a damn Yankee atheist progressive, she and her husband are southern conservative Christians), but family is family. We cared about each other and everything was great.

Then 2016 happened. Her husband made things absolutely intolerable. A recent visit was marred by ""discussions"" about politics, and her husband would constantly post the most extremist, vile, awful stuff on Facebook. I've since left Facebook, and haven't talked to them since.

I feel awful about it, but what do you do when people you love become really involved in a cult? I simply can't reconcile with that part of the family and their bigoted, ignorant beliefs. What's sad is that they have two daughters that are just the sweetest, smartest kids. They'll likely become poisoned by whatever mind-rot they espouse, and I can't do anything about it.

To anyone who lost family and friends to all of this, I'm empathetic. I think it's important to share our stories so that we know we're not alone. If the time ever comes where these folks see the error in their ways, I think it's important to let them know how you feel/felt, and attempt to reconcile. If they fail to see that they are following a cult of disinformation and bigotry, then they deserve the consequences of a fractured family.",QAnonCasualties

Didn‚Äôt really get worried until about late 2019 when she started sending out links to people &amp; organization identified by the SPLC as hate groups. 2020 though...she went from the frog in a gradually warming pot to a frog in a pot of boiling oil that she is absolutely determined to push, pull, or drag her friends and family into, truth be damned. 

I‚Äôm sick, absolutely sick. I used to talk to my mom a few times a week. Now it‚Äôs all I can do to make a token call every few months. I love her but to see and hear the things she says...I can‚Äôt be around her if I hope to avoid moving from love to full hate. I‚Äôve tried carefully walking her through facts, taking her to original materials like court documents, videos posted on her preferred sources (ok, not lately since she‚Äôs now convinced Fox is a weaponized Antifa-run propaganda machine), but facts be damned if A batshit crazy crackhead pillow salesman makes a fucking video.

237,I think my Q family members were lured in by disguised racism and misogyny,"‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù really means go back to the 50s when every white man was the king of his castle. Even if he had a shit job, at least when he got home he was the boss. The women knew they were there to look pretty, be maids and raise the kids. Legally, sex with her couldn‚Äôt be defined as rape. That was all reinforced by women not having their own money or jobs (usually) so they couldn‚Äôt leave, especially with multiple kids (5 and much more was common.) It was acceptable to spank ( or in some place more) kids, and you could require them to be seen and not heard.

POC were ‚Äúsuitably ‚Äú deferential and knew their place. That was often cheap, dirty labor and service jobs. Their living situations were far away or otherwise hidden from view, so one didn‚Äôt have to think about it.

Christian values were flaunted. of course chastity was enforced on women much more stringently than men. Husbands often got to make the decisions about their wive‚Äôs bodies.

My partner is largely covid antivax, but not fully down the Q rabbit hole (mostly, I think, because he isn‚Äôt white or american or religious). But he does believe that the vaccines have long term side effects (pathogenic priming), covid numbers are made up (largely because all U.K. deaths are being logged as such, within 28 days of a positive test), but that covid lockdowns are all the first steps in the great reset. 

We have respectfully agreed to not discuss any of this as we are so misaligned, (which is working for now), but I am still trying to understand what it is that he believes when it comes to the great reset.

One of my other friends pointed out that it was fake, and I looked into it and agreed/admitted that yes, it is actually fake, and I also posted a link to a fact checking site where it is deemed fake, because that's what a normal, sane person does when they find out they shared something that wasn't true. 

Q person responds to my comment saying ""There it is, YOU admitted to sharing fake news!!! I'd like to see people like you get sued one of these days!!!""

244,This worked for my friend.,"First of all, I honestly believe that some 'news' sites and Facebook echo chambers are like drugs and far right followers and conspiracy theorists are the addicts, they need to be weaned off this feed and drip fed with some positivity. 

A friend of mine was DEEP into this and I don't want to go into too much detail or background as it hurts too much. I have known this person for over 20 years. My one last shot to help him worked. I want to share it with you.   

His phone was experiencing problems and I said I would be happy to look at it for him. He needed to replace his SD card and I said I would back up his pictures and reset his phone with a new card. 

As I was doing this and going through his old pictures, it made me really sad as I could see how his interests changed from loving the outdoors and being in nature to quite unhinged beliefs about conspiracy theories. 

After backing up his pictures and sorting his phone out, I logged into Facebook on his phone and unfollowed ALL the hate and conspiracy groups he follows on Facebook, literally every single one. I then started following picture pages like 'Beautiful villages' and woodworking pages with arts and crafts stuff that he USED to love. His hobbies included woodworking so I followed a few pages on that. He also had an old car he has been wanting to fix up so I followed some pages on them. 

I gave him his phone back and he complained a few times about how Facebook ""is all messed up"" and I said I would look into it for him but never did.

This was about 3 months ago. 

Now everytime he grabs his phone to get his next 'hit' of confirmation bias, he is faced with scroll after scroll of non-offensive material. NO news, NO hate, NO propaganda. Slowly, he is emerging out of this and each time he shares non offensive material from one of these pages it makes me smile. I have even started following a few of these pages myself so I can tag him in stuff I think he will like. 

There is still a LOOOONG way to go on this journey but I truly believe he is heading in the right direction now as he seems a LOT happier and nowhere near as angry as he used to be.",QAnonCasualties

My brother recently told the family that he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt talk about it‚Äù but he‚Äôs being vetted by a group called the Idaho Assembly. He lives in Boise. He says it‚Äôs a group of ‚Äúgood people standing up for our rights‚Äù and that this Biden thing is ‚Äúterrifying for America.‚Äù Sounds harmless right?

He proceeds to tell me that they use VPN or dark web to communicate so they can‚Äôt be tracked. They require you never tell anyone any more specifics. They‚Äôre ‚Äúvetting‚Äù him. He was brought in by a longtime trusted old friend. Sounding less harmless. 

I have this horrible gut-wrenching feeling it‚Äôs something much darker than he‚Äôs revealing. I‚Äôve had my suspicions that‚Äôs he‚Äôs caught up in Q or at least sympathizes. He‚Äôs very prone to that kind of conspiratorial thinking, always has been. He thinks the election was rigged, etc etc. Over 6-8 months his Facebook activity went from an occasional birthday wish or tagged photo to sharing far-right propaganda daily. I won‚Äôt list all of the different theories he subscribes to, but suffice to say he believes many of the ideas people who are scared of progress and misinformed believe in (my commentary). 

I asked him explicitly if this group was violent and expressed my deep concern for getting caught up in any ‚Äúsecret‚Äù group. He of course says it‚Äôs not violent and that he has a right to fight for his beliefs. 

I‚Äôm posting this because I‚Äôm trusting my immediate instinct that this sounds dangerous, that something is off. Has anyone heard of this particular group? Are there specific militant or violent sects of QAnon? Or is Q not necessarily linked to violent groups, just online stuff?

251,How do Q followers never doubt their perception?,"This is a genuine question for those who have Q followers close to them in their life. Thankfully, I have none, so I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding for myself how they think. 
So I‚Äôve been through my own trauma and hardships in my life, in fact similar to what many Q followers have gone through. As a result, I feel like sometimes I have a heightened need for outside validation in my emotions and perceptions of reality to assure myself I‚Äôm seeing things clearly. This is probably a result of the gaslighting I‚Äôve been subject to at a developmental age. This is just generally speaking. 
My question is, how does this thought/idea of ‚Äúcould I be wrong? Could my perception not be based in truth?‚Äù not occur to Q followers at all??? They‚Äôre constantly being confronted by things counter to what ‚Äútheir truth‚Äù is, by media, by scientists, by family members. Do they never ever even entertain the thought that their perception of things are skewed? How do they constantly reassure themselves that THEY are the ones with their heads on straight? Even if I tried to surround myself with an echo chamber of likeminded people, I don‚Äôt think I could ever isolate myself completely from the haunting thought of whether or not I was always right ‚Äî especially when relationships with others and my own well-being is on the line. 
The person who gaslit me in my youth was narcissistic. The narcissistic person would have their own perception of reality that they would push on me as fact. Is this directly related to the way Q followers think? Do they all suffer from a narcissistic personality where their agenda is solid as stone? Do you think these individuals have doubts deep deep down, but they have a way of dismissing them before they rise to surface enough to have them question their beliefs? If so, in what way do they do this?

Here's the thing.  Before Jan 6th occured I had several of my Trumpist family members call me and ask me if me and my husband were ready for the 6th.  They were insinuating a civil war was going to start that day, to be prepared.   I remember my response being, 

""yes I'm ready to get these election results solidified and on to a new President""

Of course they stayed quiet.  My mother a Trumpist also noted she knew some people going to the capital to support Trump and that she thought they were crazy bc of how bad it's gonna get down there.  A Trumpist calling other Trumpist crazy....lol...

anyway, Mind you this was first few days of January that my fam asked me about Jan 6.  When I responded to my brother about it, he called me a POS on fb, told me to not come running to him for protection when shit hits the fan then  blocked me....Nice!  A very close friend of 33years also blocked me after calling me a communist and telling me I live in a fantasy world and will be crying when I see whats to come and wishing I listened.

So my question is this...IF Trump didn't instigate, and the Q cult didn't instigate the 6th then WTH were all these wackos talking about?  They obviously knew or were having communications amongst themselves in their groups and chat rooms!  

My ex friend who blocked me on fb of course now cries that these weren't Trump supporters who attacked the capital...of course they were the democrat liberals looking to make Trump country look bad...of course!!! SMH. yet this ex friend told me before the 6th that I'd be crying when I see whats coming.  How interesting!  

So have any of you experienced similar notices or questions from ur Qrazies before the 6th as if they knew something was being planned?

I mean it's pretty obvious to me and I know all you agree but they can't even see this when it's as clear as day and I question them about it!!!!

His businesses impacted by COVID, like a lot of businesses were, but he has not had to close down any of his businesses. 

I live in Los Angeles and unless you live under a rock, we went through a horrible COVID crisis that peaked (I think) a month ago. We were told not to dial 911. There was a massive pile-up of bodies, ambulances lined up around the block outside hospitals, gift shops converted into Covid wards, and things got so bad that they even allowed more cremations than are usually allowed. 

My Dad texted the family group chat that COVID would definitively be over in April due to herd immunity. This article was written by a pancreatic surgeon. I responded by saying ""I sure hope so, LA is still dealing with the aftermath."" 

QDad: Those numbers are garbage. 

Me: Whose? The Doctors and nurses? The funeral directors? The coroner's office which has the national guard with trailers for dead bodies? My own self bc I had to go to the big Kaiser to pick up a prescription and saw the madness from across the parking lot? HOW ARE WE ALL LYING?! AND WHY??

QDad: You can't beat the numbers. There were 0-3.4% excess deaths last year. And that's the CDC. Look at the math. 

\[It was not, in fact, the CDC.\]

\*\*Me googling that on the computer\*\*\*

*Sending link.* 

Me: Dad that's not true according to peer reviewed articles by infectious disease doctors and public health experts. We actually have more excess deaths than usually reported in excess of what has been reported as covid deaths. 

QDad: Thats not true. Do the math. The numbers are the numbers and the math is the math. 

Me: Okay but where are you getting the numbers because I cannot see. Dad, is this going to be like the election thing? 

QDad: You are too smart for this. The military vote in Fulton County was 85% for Biden when in the rest of the country the military vote was 75% for Trump. That's as impossible as getting struck by lightning and winning the lottery on the same day. The numbers don't lie. 

Me: Dad, I am looking at exit polls and the Military's own polling and I do not see anywhere that 75% of active members or Veterans were polling/voting for Trump. I am looking at the Military Times' website, which has the military much more evenly split. And I would think that yes, the military vote would be significantly different in Atlanta (Fulton County) than nationwide, as it has much higher rate of Black voters, first time Democratic voters, and Democratic voters in general. Can you send link so that we are on the same page? 

QDad: The numbers are the numbers. The math is the math. That is so many standard deviations apart its a statistical improbability. You can't argue with math. And yes, the Republican vote in the military is 75%. 

Me: \*\*\*\*physically doing math trying to keep up\*\*\* So actually, I think it would be statistically very possible for Atlanta's vote to be very different than the general vote. I mean...because the Fulton County vote in general is an indicator. Dad,  do you mean they voted Republican or voted for Trump? Like 2004 Bush or Trump 2016?

b) people who understand a lot about it and are able to give me any background information from a more informative point of view

These could obviously be the same person.

My main aim with the article is not so much to raise awareness of it as I'm not sure what good that will do but explore the causes and reasons that people believe it because I must admit I find it very interesting.

I appreciate this is a sensitive subject for a lot of people, but I if anyone wants to discuss their experience please drop me a message.

If anyone can direct me to any good resources to get a handle on any of the finer details that would be also be very helpful great.

Thanks in advance.",QAnonCasualties
271,Please advice,"Hi, 

My name is Andres from Uruguay in south America.

I need advice because this insanity went to far.

I never had to many friends but suddenly  it seems as if I choose my friends out of Nazi Germany.

The first one is Christian, i ' ve known him since i was 8, he always believed in this conspiratorial B.S. but nevertheless I never took him seriously, know he is totally addicted to this B.S. spending day and night fighting against pedophiles, democrats, left wing people etc. When Trump lost he said, im going to the states to fight till death for Trump and I answered to him, Trump would die for you?

His answer was silence, I asked the brother of my late grandfather about this (he is 104) and I was answered, ""in the 30s i also had to deal with fascist friends, when they started with that issue I asked them to change subject otherwise i would leave, I care more about you done your opinions, you decide"". So he was able to keep his friends for at least 30 years more, but i dont know if I will be so successful.

The second one is Pedro, I met him since I was 5 and we even purchase a car together, he was always a little nerdy and in the lost couple of years he started paying atention to all these culture wars. Abortion, homosexuality, sexual rights etc.

He become obsessed with these issues and later went full anon. He believes so badly about election fraud, covid 19 conspiracies and qanon itself. I told him all arguments possible showing that the fraud was a lie and he answered me ""don't try changing my mind, that's criminal"", I knew this was too much.

I started reading regarding disinformation, conspiracies and other far right issues, I couldnt understand how people so smart and centered decided to adopt these lies. The last time I met Pedro he started with the Dominion conspiracies and I told him it was absolutely wrong and that the judicial branch even said so, and he answered me ""Great idea believing in the judicial branch"".

Later went on and accused me of changing his mind and i answered that is what sects say ""dont dare changing my mind"". 

I wish still being Christian and Pedro's friend but I can't believe these are the people i met so long before, my friends were not fascists. How can they become normal people again?",QAnonCasualties
272,Ran into the Qex today,"I went to the beach and parked where we always parked. I didn‚Äôt see his car, so I thought I was fine. I‚Äôve been a lot recently and haven‚Äôt run into him. I saw him as I walked over the boardwalk, but ignored it. 

He ran up to me and told me he‚Äôs had dreams about me and knew he would see me today. He told me that I was incredibly hostile towards him, and I was. I told him I didn‚Äôt like or love who he has turned into.

He asked if I would still accept I was wrong if he had proof...and he definitely had proof. It would just take him a month or two to get it to me. He kept insisting he had proof. I told him to tell me what it was, and that he had 10 minutes. 

The next 45 minutes were spent with him telling me some fantasy story about ‚Äúpeople who don‚Äôt agree working together to find the truth,‚Äù and being upset that I wouldn‚Äôt listen to him. I told him I didn‚Äôt want some bullshit fantasy that he was laying out. 

I was doing okay. It has been about a month. I have codependent tendencies and this was a huge issue for me early on, but I remained NC. I was doing well, all things considered. I feel like, while our interaction solidified my decision to leave, mentally and emotionally it put me back a few steps. Several, to be honest. 

He told me that he will continue to try to find the truth for me. That he will wait for me. That he will try to make things better for me. I told him I‚Äôm moving and I thought he wanted a free ride to where I‚Äôm going. I‚Äôm not in danger of him going crazy and stalking me (I‚Äôve been through that before). 

But I genuinely think he wants to ‚Äúwake me up‚Äù and wants a happy life for us. But he‚Äôs doubled or even tripled down on the Q stuff since we broke up, and I partially think that it‚Äôs because we broke up. He‚Äôs had nothing else going for him and none of his friends agree with his bullshit. 

It‚Äôs hard to see it hurt him so much, but it really solidifies my decision to leave him. Things only got worse. A small part of me hoped that leaving would wake him up. He finally admitted outright to following QAnon, so that was validating. 

Sorry for the rant. Today has been difficult.",QAnonCasualties
273,My Q obsessed father is hurting my family,"Every time I come downstairs, he's listening to X22 report or OAN. He tells my mom that I'm not informed and he's brainwashing my brother. Both of them pedal conspiracies to each other and talk about the ""battle of good and evil"" and other religious bs. I can see it weighing in my mother. She's told me she's losing hair and that she can't sleep, and I feel so guilty. Her and I always have to defend ourselves from their verbal and condescending attacks on our intelect. The saddest part is that my parents were a model relationship to me and I have never seen them in a conflict like this. We don't have any good family moments anymore and I just see my mom internalizing it so badly. My dad is now revealing to me that he only cares about being right and having power over others.

It took me a long time to finaly question my Mothers ways and getting shots behind her back as soon as I turned 18. I really dont have the best relationship with her but since the vax for covid came out she went totaly crazy. I suspect strongly she is on the way to depression or already has some kind of mental illness. The thing is she just wont listen to anything that isnt her way. She is building her own bubble around this baaaaaad baaaaaaad vax. She is posting articels of conspiracy websites and stopt talking to her friends. She tried to convince my grandma to not get the shot. (I had to calm her down after that because she was worried I mithg think as my Mother) She is more and more shutting herself from anyone who tries to talk sens into her. My sister had a huge argument as she was the only one left talking to her about vax and these believes flying around. But my Mother just thinks she is the one who understood the worl and we were just to closed minded. She thinks this Bill Gates stuff is stupid for the ones not smart enough to see throuth all it. I know this woman. (19 years with her made me having to see a psychologist) I am about to shut contact with her but I feel awful by just letting her in this hole she is digging herself... After all is this kind of ignorance the base on wich these people life. So any tips on how to maybe get to a woman who is so full of herself that kinda anything that wont fit into her selfmade world is stupid and close minded(and an attac on her as a person)?

280,How to react to more personal/direct conspiracy theories?,"Every now and then, I get to hear a new story that sounds very qanon-esque, but thematically had to be created by people we know. For example, my mother recently told me there was a person she personally knows who was told by workers of a crematory that they don't have any capacities left because of people who died because of the vaccine.

It's not one of those typical theories that most people ignore, but a story that had to be created by one of those few people. Therefore, it's (in theory) more likely to be true, which I still don't believe. The point is that I have no idea how to react to things like that.",QAnonCasualties

284,Having Qanon parents while being a CSA survivor,"Trigger warning for talk of child sexual abuse / pedophilia.

.

i, like many, have lost my parents to qanon. theyre detached from reality, even going as far as to say biden is being ""hologrammed"" into the white house through special cameras, that hes not actually there. they believe in pizzagate, anti vaxx stuff, that democrats are eating babies, trump is the second coming of christ, all that weird stuff.

the thing that bugs me the most, however, is that as far as my knowledge goes, the point of Qanon is that theres supposedly some whole underground deep-state thing(?) where every democrat ever is a pedophile. and trump, the guy who has multiple rape allegations against him, the guy who raped children and acts creepy with his own daughter...is somehow gonna be the one who stops all this? really?

growing up i had experienced repeated sexual abuse both by a neighbor and a classmate, starting from the age of 4. i told my parents what was happening, and what did they do? they ignored it. they saw me come home with bruises and they just brushed it under the rug. my school didnt give a shit either because the principal was a pedophile too and shut down any of my teachers concerns. they allowed it to continue for years. now im an adult with PTSD, an eating disorder, and addiction issues.

knowing this, and thinking about their attachment to Qanon, i cant help but feel so, so incredibly fucking angry and betrayed. why is this grown man who raped multiple children is the one you care so much about and not your child? was my abuse just not worth trying to help? do they think i lied about it? i dont know what to do. seeing them worship and kiss the shoes of the man who hurt children, made them go through the same thing i did, makes me so sick to my stomach. i cant even imagine how the victims of him feel; to have to see their abuser walk around in the white house being hailed as this all-good evil stopping pedophile killing man, or whatever it is. its disgusting.

i hear my parents talk about how they think that ""if the victims were *really* hurt they would have reported it when it was happening!"" as if they werent children. CHILDREN. they were probably too young and scared to understand what was happening at the time. i never ever want to hear these people talk about how they care so much about saving kids when theyre worshipping a child rapist.

i really, really cant bring myself to be nice anymore or feel pity. i hate this entire movement with everything i have and feel disgust towards anyone who supports it. they are turning a blind eye to actual people who were hurt as children as well as children who are still being hurt, all while worshipping a pedophile. its disgusting and i will never be able to forgive my parents, not after this.",QAnonCasualties
285,Did Q change them? Or did it bring their real selves out more?,"I have read so many heartbreaking stories in here. For me it‚Äôs been easier, I have lost some friends, but mostly friends who I used to know and I have now discovered what beliefs they really hold out in the public I guess. 

Fortunately for me, my wife and I are very much on the same page politically on most things, same for my current circle of friends. My family has a few conservatives in it but to the best of my knowledge have a healthy disdain for Trump and all this Q nonsense.

But as I read through here, I have seen so many stories about marriages ending in divorce, couples breaking up, parents disowning their children, children disowning their parents. It‚Äôs been really sad. And I realize how lucky I am.

It got me wondering though. Those of you who have had these nasty splits with people closer to you, people you love/d, was it Q? I was Q the final straw? Can this cult really take an otherwise kind and loving person and turn them into these twisted shadows of their former selves?

I must confess, I don‚Äôt know a lot about the psychology of cult, but I have been wondering if this many people could have all been this bad a judge of character? It seems to me now that many of the Q followers must have been other people once upon a time, kind people who loved and could be loved in return. 

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if my scorn for the bigotry and delusion the Q followers display should be tempered with more pity and sympathy? 

And if this is not who they were, it makes this so much more tragic. It goes from finding out who someone really is to what I can only imagine then feels like a bereavement, a genuine death of the former self. Like seeing their body but the soul, the personality that made that person is gone. And I honestly don‚Äôt know what is worse...",QAnonCasualties

289,Ex Qanon former conspiracy member: the single greatest cure for conspiracy thinking,"Is education.  I've been thinking a lot about this after my ama last month. Basically, conspiracy thinking is Organized Ignorance. It feels smart,  it feels like critical thinking, but as the saying goes ""It's easy to think everything is a conspiracy when you don't know how anything works."" 
 
It was a very basic understanding of computers that tipped me off that Q was a fraud. You won't run into many pilots who are flat earthers. You won't run into many (sadly a few) medical doctors who are anti vaccine. There's an old meme among ex Mormons that ex LDS members know significantly more about the history of the church than current members.  
  
There is also a huge amount of conspiracy thinking  based on mistrust in authority and experts. I once saw a pastor from NY preaching about flat earth, but he starts the whole sermon by asking his church to raise their hands if they think the government lies. They all agreed, and that's all he needed to convince them of his insane theory.

290,Partners with QAnon Parents and Very Different Experiences,"My partner and I have been together for just over a year now. Over that timeframe, we have watched side by side as our parents become slowly eaten alive by QAnon. 

My situation is much more stable. My dad is an OG QAnon follower and proudly daunts his Q hat in public. We spoke in depth about Q, it‚Äôs history, and what it means to him over the holidays and I was shocked that it turned into a thoughtful conversation from both sides. It ended with my father saying the reason he follows QAnon is for the smallest offhand chance that it might be true outweighs what in reality is a somewhat boring truth.

My partner on the other hand has a much more severe situation. When I met his parents originally they struck me as a spitting image of my family- conservative but not lost on false statements. Once COVID hit, there was a drastic shift in their behavior and they dove in head first into QAnon. His entire extended family encourages them as well, buying bogus Christian based prophecy books with a literal quote I shit you not saying ‚Äúif the chiefs win the Super Bowl it will be a symbol from Jesus that our commander Donald Trump is too a strong chief‚Äù. I found some of this literature while we were house sitting for his parents and I showed him. We flipped through the pages half laughing at these crazy statements. He dismissed it and we didn‚Äôt talk about it much after. The months after we‚Äôre filled his family picking fights with him and trying to shove their QAnon beliefs down my partners mouth (thankfully he resisted and still has).

Things finally hit a boiling point after the insurrection at the capital. His mother (who is always his worst bully) has been relentlessly targeting, belittling, and deliberately hurting my partner as her way to cope with the fact that QAnons beliefs are crumbling at her feet. Finally, my partner snapped last week and laid into his parents and their QAnon beliefs. They told him that he was brainwashed and by putting him into the public education system/college (he was homeschooled a large portion of his life) they have lost their son to the liberal media. Ultimately, this ended with them cut him off financially. He came home and apologized for not listening to me sooner about my concerns about their QAnon beliefs, but all I could do was apologize to him for how cruel and hurtful his family has been to him for the sake of QAnon. 

We are managing through this situation, but this platform gave me the courage to share our story as well",QAnonCasualties
291,"Lurker, first post","So I've been reading all your stories and I felt it is time to share my own. I'd lost two great friends to QAnon and started to push away a few other friends that started speaking about Q. 

My first friend we will call A. We were best friends in high school and after, we basically were able to get away with typical teenager bs because my parents weren't strict but hers were. Her dad was a Vietnam vet, but never sought treatment and I believe he was abusive to her and her siblings. On June 28, 2017 (my wedding anniversary) her parents died when their home exploded and her youngest sister the only survivor. This is when I think she started to have lots of problems emotionally. She's married, has retired from the Air Force, has two sons and moves to a new state, but still comes back to our hometown to deal with insurance and fighting the company that sold her parents the faulty propane. Now fast track to current times, in I want to say July she started posting some Q on her Facebook and I had read it twice before reaching out ans asking what that was about. She went head first into saying her husband introduced it to her, that she's been watching all these child rape stories come out and basically not sleeping because she has to know how to protect her boys. Her words - you're a mother too, you need to know these signs. She sent me everything- From Behind the Shadows to John P and how he is the true rapist behind all these celebrities and how Tr*mp is going to save us. I watched with an open mind, found it all to be seriously ridiculous and I was afraid of where it was turning her jnto. I told her there is no way a man who has sexual assault charges coming from young kids is going to save us, and she said ""that's because those are false and won't hold up. Why do you think they've never gone through, because they're lying.""  She even told me how long her family won't be sheep and wear a mask because that also was fabricated to control us. She told me how her family in Colorado went to get tested, waited but left ans still got a call they were positive for Covid even though they never got tested. She was still going to send her kids to in school learning maskless and nothing was true about kids getting covid. I stopped poking around with these stories because honestly, I feel like these theories are enough to put someone in a mental hospital and seek treatment, they're making good people turn into crazed nightmares. Unfortunately, I had to stop because at the time we were served an eviction notice from my nmom and things were getting quite rough and she had sent me several videos while we house hunted and got upset with me that I told her I can't watch these anymore. She posted several on her Facebook ans Instagram accounts, and when she deleted those accounts, I blocked them. It still hurts because I truly loved this girl and have so many wonderful memories but she has lost her way and fully drank the Q Kool Aid. 

My other friend is P. I've known her since she and my sister were in elementary and she was also a bridesmaid in my wedding. She definitely would be the type to fall for Q because she followed every trend that she could get into. All summer long, she would post up to 10-15 things on social media A DAY (while having a toddler and becoming pregnant by her deadbeat boyfriend) and it was always hashtag save the children. So I muted her because I couldn't take her seriously, some things she posted would just be so false that even when she was called out for it she found a way to spin it into truth. After she had her second baby, she stopped posting the child abuse links and fell into the whole astrology and witchcraft postings, and how to cut out toxic family members. What made me finally cut her off was again the postings about Tr*mp saving us, that everyone is a child predator and she's warned us all. 

It's really sad that I chose to end these friendships, 20+ years, but these women fell so far into these QAnon lies and chose to only talk to people thst believes this. When I talked to A I tried so hard to get her to come out of this, how it's just people making up stories and rumors to ""cancel"" the celebs they're annoyed by. I just worry because they both have children, how this will affect their parenting and hopefully the kids turn out alright.",QAnonCasualties

She was all for it, until recently. Another one of my family members is in college, and when she graduates she is going to be a nurse, and she had the bright idea to tell someone who has cancer to not get the vaccine.  It still shocks me while typing it. 

I don‚Äôt know how much this is Q related, but I‚Äôm thinking it has something to do it. This family member is a huge Trump supporter, a lot of my family likes him but she‚Äôs extreme, and months back I remember her talking about the sex trafficking, and she also thinks Michelle Obama is a man (idk if that‚Äôs related to Q but it sounds like something they would say). She was planning on going to the capitol as well, but I forget why she didn‚Äôt end up going. She also said that COVID would go away once the election was over, again this is someone who is going to be a nurse. 

So now my family member is skeptical regarding on if she should get the vaccine or not, I think she‚Äôll end up getting it, but it‚Äôs still scary to think about.

Hunkering down for a night of heroic ""digital soldiering"", TOGETHER, and feeling a zing of excitement, TOGETHER, about all the ""arrests"" of ""global elites"" carried out that day. Going to bed - TOGETHER, not hours and rooms apart, and sharing, TOGETHER, in a sense of accomplishment for having deepened our understanding of the world and above all for helping to #savethechildren. If only I could join him there, then he wouldn't feel  like he is married to someone ignorant and inferior to him in every way, unworthy of respect or kindness. How could anyone fault me for suddenly, inexplicably and erroneously believing, twisting my brain into knots, cutting off circulation just so that we could be together again? So that he could really love me?",QAnonCasualties
307,Kicked out my (stbx) Qhusband tonight...,"I posted before about Q husband getting his gun license, and requiring me to sign off on it.

After I found out he got his license, I told our toddler that if he ever sees a real gun to make sure he never touches it and to call mom or dad.  He repeated this to his dad (I don't think there's anything wrong in telling a 4 year old that) and of course Qultist blows up at me telling me I'm putting fear into our kid about guns. Which I never did. Later our kid goes to bed and Qultist is talking to me about how he'll be safe with a gun, it will never be loaded in the house, etc.

I just tell him that I don't like when he talks about executing people (which is true), and he cuts me off and blows up at me telling me ""what do you think should happen to people who rape children?""...  and if I think he's going to go out killing people, I don't know him at all.  I never said I thought he was going out to kill people, I said that I don't feel comfortable with all the darkness he talks about and constantly talking about executing people.  He tells me I'm mental and that we are living in Communist China (we are Canadian). He also has to throw in, as long as people keep wearing masks, we will be a communist country.  He's standing up for our rights, and I'm just blind to everything.   I just told him to stop talking down to me.  He argues more that I don't support him and asks me what do I even care about? I need to stand up for what's right, and stand beside him because he's been doing this alone. He asks what I want, and I tell him to put his phone down for 1 day!!!  He says I never support him but I've put up with this sh!t for 4 years.  He says it's all at the precipice and then goes back to me not caring about babies being raped and killed... (excuuuuuuse me????)  at this point I just about had it.

He ask if I want him to stay or leave (we had a huge fight a few weeks ago where I told him I was done with his obsession) and I just tell him to 'GO'.  He changes into his QAnon shirt (HUGE EYEROLL) and as he's packing his bag to go stay with a friend, he tells me ""there's only so much a person can take until it's not worth it anymore"".... I mean, can you people believe this???  He's put up with me not caring about the Deep State and cabal and has had enough with me.   Of course, all this after I put my foot down and tell him to leave. I'm not going to have ANYONE tell me I don't care about babies being murdered. Disgusting. Pardon my french, but FUCK HIM!

The manipulation is real with this one.  I'm really sad my marriage is ended.  My first post here was a stark contrast from this one.  Now I'm somewhat relieved I won't have to listen to him rant about the Deep State MSM or cabal, or tyranny, communism, or ANY OF IT.  I feel like I can have my life back.  Tonight I'm going to sit here and watch a movie, whatever movie I want, without having to deal with his bullsh!t.  It's going to be a hard road ahead, but I already feel a weight lift.

I'm obviously super heated right now, but thank you for letting me rant.

Edit: he doesn‚Äôt have a firearm yet as I never signed off on his forms.  I was just preemptively talking to my toddler, in case a firearm came into our home (without my knowledge). I‚Äôm also NOT afraid of firearms, I just don‚Äôt think someone like him should have access to one (maybe before Q, but definitely not now).  A part of me feels like the ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô for not letting him have his guns, but I don‚Äôt want to be in the same house with him and firearms",QAnonCasualties

309,Dad maybe Q,"I‚Äôm very concerned that my already right-leaning dad is the QAnon cult. He‚Äôs a lonely, widowed Boomer (prime target) and on the computer or phone incessantly. Recent call with him raised red flags. I don‚Äôt bring up politics with him but he always does. Usually it‚Äôs done much more elegantly. This seemed almost scripted which is very unlike him. He kept spouting nonsense. I kept asking him where he heard or read about his (unfounded) information. He would only respond with ‚Äòthat‚Äôs what I feel‚Äô or ‚Äòbelieve‚Äô. I‚Äôve heard the same crazy shit from others so it‚Äôs not new. However the manner in which he was speaking to me was also eerily calm. Which is also out of character because he‚Äôs quick-tempered and known to raise his voice. There was none of that. After I asked him to verify a very a specific theory he was rambling on about. He accused me of not respecting his beliefs.  He also said that he didn‚Äôt go to a liberal school and no one is going to change his mind. He said so many other nonsensical things that I don‚Äôt really remember. I was just stunned. 
Then he told me to think about it. ‚ÄòIt‚Äô being my supposed disrespect. No sooner than my lips could form a syllable in response, he ended the call! WTF??!!",QAnonCasualties
310,Farewell to a long ago bestie,"A friend, now acquaintance whom I long ago considered as close as a sister has gone Q. On her FB page I discovered crazed Q propaganda including anti Democrat (Biden/pedo-cannibal), ""Save the children"" Pizzagate, ""Get the pedos"" pix of several male democratic politicians and ""liberal"" celebrities. The page reflected anger brewing in conspiracies it made me feel ill realizing I no longer knew this person. I sent her a message asking ""Are you into Q?"" her reply was a rambling explanation of well...somewhat. I knew she had sought salvation from living a slightly crazy party life back in the day and found it in extreme evangelical religion which is when we started on seperate paths.  In the real world yes there are actual conspiracies, yet the ones embraced by QAnon followers are outrageous, ridiculous and dangerous.  I suspect her spouse and adult child might also be Q, yet will never know as I doubt I'll ever speak with her again. I recently discovered a neighbor who I thought was sharp bordering on Q, now I only exchange pleasantries and try to avoid any contact.",QAnonCasualties
311,Time to Move On.,"I found QanonCasualties when there were fewer than 3,000 members, and now that number has swelled to fifty times that size, which is both personally comforting and tragic. I have read thousands of posts--now it is my turn to share.

One year ago today, I proposed to the woman that I loved. In the months following the engagement, our relationship fell apart, overwhelmingly due to Qanon. The unique aspect of our story is that my ex-fianc√©e never believed in Qanon. She is a wonderful person and she is as much of a victim in this story as I am. I can only hope that our story will be a cautionary tale for those experiencing similar situations and that those relationships can persist where ours did not.

Around six months prior to our engagement, I became aware that my ex fianc√©e‚Äôs mother was deeply involved in a movement called Qanon. I did not know much about the movement, other than that it believed in conspiracy theories that were totally illogical. That changed one night at dinner, when my then girlfriend‚Äôs mother told me about the cabal of satanic pedophiles that ran the world and would drink the blood of tortured children. With a straight face, she reeled off a dozen names and groups involved in this ‚ÄúDeep State,‚Äù and the overwhelming majority of these names were Jewish people and minorities (Soros, Rothschild, Rosenstein, Mossad, Oprah, Obama, etc.).

While I am not very religious, I am Jewish. I spoke out and said that these beliefs were untrue and were anti-Semitic in nature, as the Adrenochrome theory she espoused was almost identical to the rumors of Blood Libel that had existed against Jewish people for centuries. I implored her to find other news sources and to get out of her echo chamber, and at minimum, told her not to bring up these theories around me any further.

Over the following months, the stories continued. I told my girlfriend how much it bothered me, and she asked her mother to stop bringing the matters up in my presence, but to no avail. Finally, after our engagement and the outbreak of the Coronavirus, her mom crossed the line. Just before Easter, the mother spoke of ‚Äú10 days of Darkness‚Äù that would be followed by the military round up of the cabal, which would be taken to Guantanamo Bay to be imprisoned and executed. The parallels of this ‚ÄúStorm‚Äù to the Nazi roundup of Jews was too much for me to stand. I looked to my fianc√©e and her sister and her father and asked them to say something against this hateful rhetoric, and the silence was deafening. In that moment, I felt abandoned, and it reminded me of a famous quote by Martin Luther King Jr., ‚ÄúIn the end, we will not remember the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.‚Äù

I spoke out forcefully and said how hateful and dangerous those beliefs were, and that I would not sit by and listen to lies and the demonization of groups of people, nor would I permit any children we may have in the future to be exposed to such sentiments. The following day, my fianc√©e‚Äôs father called her to revoke the blessing for our marriage, to say that if we did get married they would not attend the wedding, and to say that they would never forgive me. In essence, they gave my fianc√©e an ultimatum, her family or her fianc√©e.

While I feel a great deal of resentment towards my fianc√©e‚Äôs mother, the father is worse. The mom was a devout believer in Q and was seriously misguided--she needed help and I said as much. The father, however, was an Ivy League trained psychiatrist and a university professor, and he did not believe in Q‚Äîhe simply wanted to ignore the problem. When I was no longer willing to listen silently to the hateful rhetoric, he sabotaged his daughter‚Äôs happiness to avoid confronting the real problem, that his wife was in a cult. Only a coward would sacrifice his daughter‚Äôs happiness to avoid hard truths, and this man is the epitome of a coward, whether my fianc√©e can see that or not.

For months, my fianc√©e and I tried to do couples therapy and counseling, but the Q parents made it clear that they would never change. My fianc√©e, out of loyalty and love for her parents, would not hold her parents accountable. Instead, she asked me to remain quiet and excuse myself if the parents brought up the topic again, and to do so for the rest of our lives. I told her that I would not sacrifice my morals and ethics, and that if they were unable or unwilling to change their behavior, she could have a relationship with her parents, but I would not. Ultimately, my fianc√©e said that she could not be with someone that did not have a relationship with her family, and I said that I could not be with someone that allowed her family to spread such hate and to knowingly treat me so disrespectfully.

I loved my ex and I am saddened every day by the loss of our relationship. It is a tragedy that our loving relationship fell apart. If anyone out there is in a situation where your partner or your family members are feeling alienated due to Qanon, please know that it is important to support the person that adheres to the truth. Truth matters. Morals matter. And it is important to speak up when you hear lies. Those that spread lies are guilty of transgressions, but those that know better and choose to stay silent are the ones that allow those lies to persist.

Life is full of hard choices, and for one reason or another, my ex made the decision to choose her family over me. She has cut off all communication and has likely convinced herself that she hates me or that I abandoned her, which is far from the truth. I held out hope until now that she would see the light, but our anniversary just passed without any message, so it is time for me to move on. One day, I hope she will recognize how much I loved her.",QAnonCasualties
312,A month after my relationship with my Q boyfriend ended,"My boyfriend and I had been together for 6 years. About 7 months after the very first Q post, he started diving head first into it ALL (aside from flat earth), and his entire world view shifted. He went from a very happy, healthy, outgoing, and loving man, to someone I barely recognized. At first I didn‚Äôt know why, because he didn‚Äôt share with me why he was spending more and more time at the computer scribbling on his notepad, nor why he was completely withdrawing from his friends/family/eventually me. Finally, when I was cleaning our apartment one day while he was at work, I happened across the notepad that was turned to a numbered page of ‚Äúdisturbing things happening around the world‚Äù. This included how the Holocaust was faked, and Hilary Clinton was a satanist pedophile, etc etc. I was shocked and more than a little scared, and a week later told him I was worried about him and that I thought we needed to take a break to focus on our respective mental health (I was beginning my journey through depression at the time). 

5 months of irregular contact later, he seemed to be making the progress I wanted and hoped to see: hanging out with his friends again, spending holidays with family, initiating contact with me again. I, of course, was happy for him, and we resumed our relationship. When I finally worked up the courage to ask him about ‚Äúall the Q stuff‚Äù again, it turns out he had gone even deeper into it. I loved him enough that I tried to have reasoned arguments with him, but somehow he always made me feel stupid and I never made even the tiniest dent in his beliefs. Eventually I just stopped asking, and as time went on, he began slowly bringing these up around our friends and family. With my family, I would simply kick him under the table or shoot him a quick glare to tell him to shut up whenever he made comments that I knew were heading in that direction, but of course I couldn‚Äôt tell him what to say in front of his own. 

Fast forward several years to last spring, and I finally just had to stop talking about anything current events related/political/human rights/ANYTHING with him, because we ended up fighting and not speaking for the rest of the day. I was so tired and sad. I basically gave up on our relationship, but COVID and depression (not to mention how toxic our relationship felt by then) I didn‚Äôt feel able to leave. 

A month ago, he and I got into yet another argument, and we agreed that there was no point in continuing to be together. I still loved him, but knew that we just had fundamentally different beliefs and couldn‚Äôt agree on anything anymore.... As much as this pains me to write, I can‚Äôt express how freeing it has been. I‚Äôm able to express myself and my feelings about current events &amp; the world in general again. I‚Äôm able to talk openly with my friends and family about how crazy Qanon people are, where before I felt hypocritical doing so. I‚Äôm not nervous to see people anymore, because I no longer have to carefully navigate topics of conversation so that even the smallest thing won‚Äôt set him off. I no longer have to pretend that he isn‚Äôt racist/a conspiracy theorist. The other unhealthy aspects of our relationship aside, I can‚Äôt believe how long I ignored all the red flags of this mindset. 

This ended up being a lot longer than I intended, but also incredibly cathartic to share. I still don‚Äôt want to tell anyone in my life that he is a part of this movement, because I do still care about him and their opinions of him (and therefore me), but I‚Äôve been following this sub basically since it started and thought I might share my experience. Not to say that all Q people are beyond saving, and I hope he is among that group, I just hope anyone who reads this knows that it is TOTALLY okay to prioritize yourself and remove people like my ex from your lives.",QAnonCasualties
313,"Need advice: I've been using a DNS service to block Rumble and Bitchute, but my Q Mom wants me to help her access those sites. How should I handle this?","So my Q mom and I share a lease. My backstory can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/iwvtv7/i_live_with_a_qanon_believing_mother_who_pushes/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/jn7sa3/december_21_2020_a_significant_day_for_quiltists/). She was radicalized primarily through YouTube videos. I [attempted to tweak her YouTube algorithm](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/kik5f2/looking_for_qdebunking_youtube_videos_to_alter/) so she'd get more animal videos and a fewer conspiracy related videos, but it hasn't been a very successful endeavor because it's been more difficult for me to get access to her YouTube account than I anticipated. Plus, she also actively searches for these videos so when I have managed to add dog videos to her watch history, it gets nuked pretty fast.  

Since YouTube began removing some of the more outrageous content she enjoyed and these content producers moved to other platforms, I anticipated that she might eventually try to find her favorites elsewhere. I did some research on how to best block these platforms on our home network and my solution was to buy a Raspberry Pi, install AdGuard Home, and use it as a DNS server. This allowed me to write custom filtering rules to block sites like Gab, Parler (when it's running), Rumble, and Bitchute at the network level without installing anything on her smartphone or desktop. It's also allowed me to keep track of some of the websites she visits and the content is worse than I thought. But I'm getting sidetracked...  

Thankfully, my mom isn't on social media. She doesn't have a Facebook, Twitter, Parler, or Gab account. She isn't tech-savvy enough to figure them out. However, she can navigate the YouTube app on her smartphone. Now that worst of the content has moved to Rumble and Bitchute, she has been made aware of these platforms by the Telegram groups she's joined.\*\*\* Obviously, she doesn't know that I've blocked these sites on our home network, nor does she know that she could turn off wifi on her smartphone and access those sites using mobile data. She asked me today if I could help her ""sign up"" for them. I tried to play it off and I managed to delay the discussion until later. However, I won't be able to postpone this indefinitely. You'd think I'd have thought of how to handle this eventuality when I started blocking these sites, but I haven't. I started blocking them in hopes she would eventually lose interest, but the Telegram groups have driven her deeper down the rabbit hole. I don't have a fully developed response and I was hoping to get some advice on how to handle this.

At this rate, I don't think telling her the truth is an option. A week after the January 6th insurrection, she asked me to help her forward an insane missive by a GOP official in upstate New York to a friend (I could be mistaken on the location), and I declined to do so. She immediately called me traitor to her and to the country, and told me I was censoring her. What ensured was one of the worst encounters we've have over Trump, QAnon, and these other conspiracies since Trump came down the elevator. It was bad and it lasted hours. I don't have the emotional energy to go through that again. The only way we've managed to maintain the peace is to not discuss politics and a significant amount of gray-rocking on my part.  So yeah, no telling her the truth. Perhaps I should just stop trying to limit the amount of disinformation she can access. At this point, it really seems pointless. 

Anyway, thanks in advance for any advice....

\*\*\* Sadly, AdGuard Home doesn't block the Telegram service. You can connect to the service via a proxy, so I thought about adding a proxy that goes nowhere. I don't know if that's even a real thing though, and all of this may be for naught anyways...

Edit: I should probably add that she's not tech savvy, but she's not stupid either. She'll notice if something if it's really obvious, so I have to be somewhat subtle.",QAnonCasualties
314,Do I need to keep in contact?,"My parents were planning to join the coup attempt but decided against it at the last minute.

But my mental health has improved so much how that I'm not receiving crazy conspiracy theory links, being sent graphic videos of sexual assault to ""disprove"" BLM, hearing them talk about purging the libs, etc. I've also been increasingly worried about exposing my 5yo to their racism and hateful comments about liberals. I don't even know how to talk to them after they cut me off and refused to take my calls on my dad's birthday. I just... can't. But everyone acts like I'm being unreasonable and should just stay in contact so they're not *completely* isolated. My daughter's birthday is coming up and I have no idea what to do if they call.

317,Let's make a Deal.,"I just hung up on my mother - not for the first time - and I'm sitting here shaking, reading posts and trying to find some comfort in knowing I'm not the only one struggling with this.

She's on the same ""the COVID vaccine will kill you"" train as others have posted about recently, and is frantic to talk me out of getting vaccinated. I have a PhD in Biology and have taught cell biology to undergraduate classes, but according to her, I'm the one who doesn't understand and ""refuses to read anything from the other side."" But it's not two sides; this isn't an opinion piece. There's science, and there's wild conspiracy based on factually incorrect statements about how biology works.

Now she's saying: ""Let's make a deal. Let's have an honest debate about the science. You send me your information and I'll send you mine, and we'll both read it."" This feels like a trap. It's a baited trap - I would love to put some real information in her hands and it's SO hard to accept that logic cannot fight conspiracy - but it's a trap. She will reject everything real out-of-hand because she's been programmed to believe that she has the only credible sources.

Our fight tonight was extremely stupid. It‚Äôs 10:00 where I am and he came into my room in his underwear to lecture me about how our frequencies are changing and how he stuck it to the anti-maskers by taking his mask off in the grocery store and stealing from self checkout. I noticed he had some pee on his boxers and asked hom to change his underwear so he didn‚Äôt get pee on the couch blankets and he FLIPPED OUT. He blamed me for keeping the dog up all night and making her tired and giving her diarrhea. The dog is up all night because she follows him everywhere and he listens to qanon videos without headphones at a loud volume until 3 am. Then, he blamed me for giving him a heart attack and stressing him out. He accuses me of being a germaphobe but I really think I have basic hygiene. The bathroom is right next to my room, and I have to remind him to wash his hands after he shits, and then I get mocked and laughed at for not wanted to live in a house covered in fecal and piss matter.

Somehow, it‚Äôs me stressing him out and not being obsessed with qanon. My mom just wants to keep the peace and doesn‚Äôt defend me for my father accusing me of causing his heart attack. She‚Äôs not a qanon shithead but she‚Äôs super conservative and loves Trump.

Also, these Q-fluencers sicken me... taking innocent brainwashed people's money. Thank goodness YouTube has demonetized many of these folk's accounts, but you can see in this roughly 18-minute video, he literally mentions his PayPal every 90 seconds.

Sad this guy used to be one of my closest friends. I'm going to start doing YouTube videos for folks who want the latest info on what these Q-folks are saying and what I'm finding out in my investigations. You can follow me at [youtube.com/faranbalanced](https://youtube.com/faranbalanced)

At first, all I could think is ‚Äúthank God, I‚Äôm not alone, there‚Äôs other people dealing with this as well‚Äù, but the longer I stay and read story after story I just see and feel such absolute hopelessness. 
The rare cases where people ‚Äúunpill‚Äù themselves is due to it contradicting some of their previous belief systems in some way, but that involves having the previous knowledge in the first place. Everything we say (my gran who‚Äôs a doctor, my mother who‚Äôs a nurse, my brother who‚Äôs a physicist etc.) we‚Äôre told that it‚Äôs not true or we‚Äôre uneducated and honestly I‚Äôm done believing they‚Äôll ever be any kind of change. It‚Äôs honestly depressing how I used to think of myself as trying to be as unbiased as I could possibly be, but now, even at the mention of someone liking Trump or believing any conspiracy theory makes me squirm and instantly think they‚Äôre a terrible person like my Q-person and I hate that I‚Äôve become this person who instantaneously thinks like this.
I want success for everyone who‚Äôs affected, but it‚Äôs not gonna happen for mine and at this point, from a month ago, I just don‚Äôt talk to them anymore or even look at them in the eyes (there‚Äôs just too many things said, too many things done for me to be okay with communicating with them).",QAnonCasualties

329,Need advice about a conspiracy theorist friend and whether or not I should cut him off,"This has been on my mind a lot recently and given the fact that most of my friends dislike the friend in question, well call him ‚ÄúN‚Äù, I figured Reddit would be good for unbiased advice. I‚Äôve been friends with him my entire life. We‚Äôre both 22 and met when we were babies at his moms daycare. Our friendship growing up was great, although we went to different high schools, we still hung out often and enjoyed each others company. He was always ‚Äúthe weird kid‚Äù but never in a malicious way, he was just a strange guy in general. Growing up and for the majority of high school he was just a funny, goofy dude who was always fun to be around and a loyal friend. 

Things started to change around 2016 if I‚Äôm remembering right. Throughout high school and to this day I have several different friend groups and a wide array of friends from different walks of life. I‚Äôm friends with self described radial leftists and the friend in question who I would describe as a religious fundamentalist conspiracy theorist. In high school he got much closer to his own small friend group which consisted of very socially awkward gamer dudes who exhibited a lot of sexist and homophobic behaviour, but to be honest nothing out of the norm for high school boys. I was also friends with these guys but as time went on I only remained friends with N mostly because of our childhood bond. 

Just to clarify I don‚Äôt want this post to become political, I‚Äôm genuinely looking for unbiased advice here, but I do have to make note of our political differences and how they‚Äôve impacted our friendship. 

Around 2016 when Trump got elected he started sharing conspiracy theories with myself and our friend group at the time. It started with offhand comments and eventually became him just constantly bombarding us with conspiracies which lead to constant arguments. His relationship with some of that friend group slowly dissipated with time but even with our disagreements and arguing we remained friends. 

Things started to get even worse around two years ago when he slowly turned into a fundamentalist Christian seemingly out of nowhere. (He claims he‚Äôs always been Christian but never mentioned it before 2018ish) He became super judgmental of myself and all our friends for not aligning with his personal values. ‚ÄúGay jokes‚Äù that seemed innocent enough in high school became genuine homophobia that LGBT friends of ours have told me is the reason they‚Äôre no longer friends with him. Saying the N word in high school (he is white) turned into genuine racist tendencies and to this day in 2021 he uses the N word with a hard R constantly, even though he‚Äôs been told it‚Äôs not ok by everyone around him. I could go on but to keep it as short as I can he has slowly changed from a goofy, weird, but fun guy into a racist, sexist, homophobic, and generally unpleasant person to be around. The last straw for me recently was hearing from his sister boyfriend that his dad had been exposed to covid at work and while the rest of his family was quarantining he was still inviting friends over secretly and potentially exposing his family to covid. He is also an anti vaxxer which is going to be a big problem for me when the vaccine eventually rolls out.

What made me start writing this is after me begging him to stop sending conspiracy theories, he sent an especially stupid one to a group chat, I told him to stop sending them and that it‚Äôs insane to believe it, and he blocked me on all social media. By and large despite our differences he has been a good friend to me. He‚Äôs been there for me during very hard times and I have been very mean to him a lot of times in the past mostly due to our differences and handled situations wrong plenty of times. He‚Äôs helped me move a million times, driven me everywhere cause I don‚Äôt drive and helped out my mother with chores cause he lives in the same town as her and I do not. It hurts to say but I‚Äôm very much considering cutting him off until (or if) he changes. I just need advice because I‚Äôm very conflicted and hurt right now. Any and all advice is welcome, cheers.",QAnonCasualties
330,What‚Äôs a good way to find out without sounding judgmental?,My sister has been distant since we argued about Bill Gates back when Covid first started.

333,This is why it is so unlikely we will get our loved ones back.,"When I first started reading about Qanon two things struck me. 1. The sheer number of theories that seemed to conveniently explain pretty much anything they wanted to believe (i.e. coronavirus being a hoax, global warming not being real, the Jewish deep state) and 2. The number of people who believed in Q-related theories who also did not actually know about Q/4chan/Qanon/The Storm at all. I found it interesting that I could talk to my relatives, who did not know about Qanon and have never been on or heard of any of the Q drops spout out beliefs that were clearly started in Qanon message board sites. Additionally, I was struck by how every single thing that Qanons saw as negative was connected to the Deep State Conspiracy, and posters who were not Q just sorta posted theories that strangers on the internet just believed.

Functionally, I get how it‚Äôs happening. The theory starts on Q message boards and gains traction, then gets picked up by conservative ‚Äúnews sources‚Äù on Facebook which omits the Q-origin of the article and rebrand it as news. So now, even my 78 year old Aunt would repost a fully Q-conspiracy theory on Facebook without knowing it came from Qanon. I think it has infiltrated the Republican party so handily that way. 

Another thing was the impossibility that people actually cared about the victims of the cabal, who apparently are children. Because if you truly cared and believed that a secret cabal was eating children then why the hell would you ‚ÄúTrust the plan,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHold the line,‚Äù and just watch inane YouTube videos for proof of the conspiracy? The people who follow these theories appear to want to believe one thing: **That Donald Trump is the right, and should/will be president for another 4+ years or forever**. They will think anything to justify this belief, even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

This is just a natural progression of a ""party"" that lost its moral compass a long time ago. Many Republicans have been primed to believe conspiracies for decades and that this is nothing new for the GOP. This is not to say the Democratic Party is perfect, certainly it is not, and there have been morally bankrupt politicians on both sides (which I am sure Q people WILL LET YOU KNOW).

I am sure that anyone interested in this topic is interested in cognitive dissonance and moving the goal posts so I will not go over it again. But, remember that these are important in understanding the GOP today.

First, a brief history of the GOP since the 1960‚Äôs is important (and I would recommend, It Was All a Lie by Stuart Stevens and It‚Äôs Even Worst than it Looks by Ornstein and Mann and Why the Right Went Wrong by EJ Dionne Jr).

Basically, since Barry Goldwater‚Äôs campaign (and the Civil Rights movement), the GOP has just not attracted Black voters. Why? **Because Black voters tend to understand how to vote in their self-interest**. And in the 60s, during the Civil Rights movement, the interests of Black voters were pretty obvious. The Republican Party, particularly Goldwater, had started preaching for States‚Äô rights and a small government when, for instance, 20,000 National Guard members had to be sent to the University of Alabama for it to be safe for Black students.

Instead of attempting to win back Black voters, the Republican Party targeted working class white voters, particularly in the South. This was especially evident in the campaign of Barry Goldwater, who campaigned on a platform of individualism and anti-Communism. He won the nomination, but lost the election by a landslide, but managed to flip five southern states red with his stance against federal enforcement of the Civil Rights Act. Since the 1960‚Äôs the South has been overwhelmingly red. 

The GOP then made an effort to target ‚Äúworking class‚Äù white voters, preferably very religious and without a college education. In the 1980‚Äôs and 1990‚Äôs, especially with Reagan, the party targeted Evangelical Christians, with dogmatic hardlines against LGBTQ rights and abortion. But Evangelical Christians were not made republican through Roe v. Wade or a particular culture war...This is a fallacy of our modern times. It was a case called Green v. Conolly, which held that segregated Christian schools (such as Jerry Falwell's) could not have tax exempt status because by default, discriminatory schools, by definition, were not charitable organizations. It is a holding that makes a lot of sense, but made racist Evangelicals very angry and involved them in politics**. Evangelical organizations started up with nationalistic views and got involved in politics under the guise of being against secular culture. This was not because culture got too sexual, but because it got too integrated.** 

But then, something very curious happened. Evangelicals and Republicans at large voted for Reagan, a divorced California actor, over Jimmy Carter, a Sunday school teacher who read the Bible daily. This makes evangelical support for Trump unsurprising to say the least. People think Pence swayed evangelicals and I am sure they did not. 

The Reagan era was situated on flimsy economic theories and odd anecdotes. The oddest one being ""The Welfare Queen."" The Welfare Queen was a real person, named Linda Taylor. Taylor was a career criminal, kidnapper, and likely a murderer who was racially ambiguous and mostly white-passing. But Reagan described her in coded language ""a woman from the southside of Chicago"" who stole $150,000 in welfare. In reality, she stole $40,000 from welfare fraud but was only charged with $8,000. People assumed she was a Black woman, and she was, but she was able to impersonate Hispanic, Jewish, and Asian women in her schemes. Reagan, instead of framing this as a wacky one-off story (which it was) implied it was an example of a systemic problem.

\*Another more recent anecdote has been the Kate Steinle case, which Trump mentioned, which mirrors the ""Welfare Queen"" Reagan stuff. A five-time-deportee, a Mexican man, shot and killed a white woman in San Francisco, which was a sanctuary city. The perpetrator,  Jos√© Inez Garc√≠a Z√°rate, was found not guilty of murder because he literally picked up a gun he found and shot it. He was also found to be a paranoid schizophrenic and a vagrant who was frequently in trouble with the law. Why was he so hard to deport permanently? Well, he did not stay anywhere permanently and had few, if any, associates or family. Zarate was not a typical Mexican, not a typical migrant, and by definition of being severely mentally ill not a typical person. But that never reached the ears of Trump supporters who think that a liberal California jury insanely decided not to charge this man with murder, and that this was apparently endemic of a larger problem. It is not. 

Conservative strategy really ramped up with Newt Gingrich who started this whole ""win at all costs"" strategy. Gingrich, a very sorely mentally disturbed individual decided that winning was the new Republican strategy in congress. McConnell has followed this lead into today. But...that's not even the point. ***The point is that voting Republican is essentially voting for an opposition party.*** Like baseball fans that just want the Yankees to lose, the Republican party would grasp at anything to defeat Democrats. Unfortunately the ""Yankees"" in this case are a properly funded federal government. What you get when your platform is loosely ""small government"" is ""shitty government."" And that's what we have now. 

And this includes distorted facts about climate change, social issues, COVID, etc. People are groomed into these beliefs for a variety of reasons. But the thing is that they have been groomed for many years. And communities have been groomed. So, if you have been denying climate change for your entire life, with the mounting evidence and support for it from, well, the entire World, it is easier to believe that the World has some messed up deep state. **But even larger than that, if you are voting in such a way that necessarily goes against your own interests, then that creates a psychological (see cognitive dissonance theory) need for mental gymnastics, false justifications, and ""alternative facts"" .** And people have been doing mental gymnastics in regard to politics since the 60s. It doesn't matter if your Q person became a republican yesterday, the fact is that we have just accepted this as a fact of American life in both parties. 

All Americans are told to ""reach across the aisle,"" to ""consider other people's opinions."" This is a form of gaslighting. Have you had a feeling that the Republican party was ""racisty"" and nonsensical for a while? (Because it is.) But then, even people on the left are telling you to compromise? I think most people have. Being on the left  means you have been intensely gaslighted into thinking you are on some sort of equal playing field with a loose political strategy to win/get money. 

Think about abortion. If a person really considered it a genocide of babies, if you really thought it was murder, a violent act, then why involve your own young children in it, as many anti-choice people do? If you thought it was *murder* why sit outside abortion clinics essentially doing nothing? Because human beings have a gut instinct about what murder is and what isn't, and it simply doesn't hit us because we know it's not murder. I know there are a few nutjobs but the vast majority of anti-choice people out there say it's murder, compare it to the Holocaust, and then go about your lives living normally with this massecre apparently going on. So, youre saying if you believed the HOLOCAUST were happening you'd just sit around reposting Facebook articles? 

It's the same thing with Qanon. If you think the deep state were killing children, why would you just sit around on the computer? Why do nothing? Why ""Hold the line""? Why ""Trust the plan""? Because they have been groomed to deal with ""outrage"" this way. Because of predatory politics. Because of an opposition party that has taken over half the country. Because if you admit this is wrong, then you would admit that you have been wrong, your parents were wrong, etc. Qanon did not just ""start"" three years ago. It's been baking in the Republican oven for decades, which is why it won't just go away. The trouble for me is that it's becoming increasingly enmeshed. 

The best thing to do? Not sure. People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to double down when presented with facts. So your loved one will not just see the ""light of day"" by you telling them the facts. Truthfully, **I think the best course of action is to cut off contact until you feel psychologically safe around your Q person.** Do I love my Dad? Yes. Are we good having a conversation right now without me wanting to punch a wall? No. Hell no. 

**Tl; dr Most Q's have been groomed for their entire lifetime for this, because most Americans have been groomed for half a century into thinking the Republican Party is reasonable or stands for anything other than defunding the government where it wants to. Deprogramming would be difficult/impossible. We need to disengage with our**",QAnonCasualties

A few key points....already a Libertarian, rabid gun owner, bi-polar and has severe trust issues.  I have made myself absolutely available to her to talk about family etc. as her family is going through a rough Alzheimers time.  I've been her friend through drug overdoses, attempted suicide and involuntary commitment.  Also feverish Christianity swinging back to profound athieism.

I finally drew the line when she went off on a gigantic screed on FB tackling everything from March 4 to WWG1WGA.  Im luckily removed physically from her, but she is starting to socially distance herself from me now too.  I HAVE probably been wrong to just dismiss her with ""I see you've taken another step into conspiracy land.  I'm not going to take a part in this.""

It was very uncomfortable and even devastating for me to see the things she said and posted last year because she seemed brainwashed and like she‚Äôd passed the point of no return. Because it was too hard for me, and I determined I wouldn‚Äôt be friends with someone like that if they weren‚Äôt my family, I treated her the same way as I would non-family and removed her from my friends list in December. 

She had created a new account (which we were previously friends on) but evidently when she saw me pop up as a suggested FB friend, she thought she had simply forgotten to add me on her new account, so she messaged me about that and sent a friend request. Thinking/hoping that maybe she became one of the people who turned a new leaf once ‚Äúthe storm‚Äù didn‚Äôt happen on 1/6, I figured I would accept her request and check out her page.

It started with COVID is a hoax, it‚Äôs a ploy from big pharma to make money, and so on. Now, it seems that the rhetoric he is spouting is deeply crossed with the Q bs I‚Äôve seen. He is talking about how the PCR test is fake, all of the science is biased and then sends me videos (which always get taken down, OR they ask for your personal info or money in order to see them...like how is that not obvious?) and says ‚Äúyou see, here is proof.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs even more painful because I am a scientist. I‚Äôm a preventative medicine phd candidate. My life is dedicated to research...And he won‚Äôt believe me. He says everything I‚Äôm learning is fake. And that even my studies have been falsely guided (like even results somehow?) by higher powers. It makes no sense. 

When he brings me something easily debunkable, and I show him that eg RNA doesn‚Äôt work like that or whatever, he just says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs too bad that they‚Äôre not teaching you the reality.‚Äù And gives me a sad look.

So with him being at this level of non acceptance, is there any way to save him? I don‚Äôt think he realizes this anti science is Q territory. He used to hate trump but now I don‚Äôt even know. I don‚Äôt want to ask. With the 2016 election he was so upset when Bernie lost, he said he would rather vote trump than Clinton, if that is an indicator.

She tells me I cannot face the truth of what is happening in the world. She cannot be reasoned with and is always telling me to ‚Äúdo my research‚Äù when I try to use facts or logic to prove her wrong. It is so, so frustrating and depressing. 

Despise me asking her many, many times to just not discuss it, she simply cannot help it. This has led me to the difficult decision to take a step back and not speak to her until I feel I am ready. This makes me feel guilty and also the fact that my brothers are telling me to just ‚Äúmake up with her and move on‚Äù. When she goes on her rants, they just listen and agree to avoid any type of conflict. To me, this is what made her so bad.

As some of you may know if you've read previous posts of mine, I've lost folks to Q and I do sexual violence prevention and support work.

I figured this info could be helpful for folks if they have QPeople who focus on the trafficking portion and if they're not too far down the rabbit hole. (I think the webinar itself is interesting but I wouldn't necessarily share it with any Qpeople).

I knew I wasn't alone. but still. seeing others and reading other's experiences helps. It's my parents (in their 80s). Both trumpers, they have been republican for as long as I can remember. And really, once I left home I gave it little thought. I knew we had some fundamental differences about what we think but that divide has gotten wider. I used to feel like I was a middle of the road sort of person, could see valid points on both sides, all that. But through the years I've leaned further and further to the left. Though my Dad will still say that 'Once I'm older I'll be a republican'. My reply is 'Dad, I'm in my 40s. I think you should let that go now'.

Several years ago, I had to move back home. I had lost my apartment through a nasty breakup, and had decided to go back to school. It was hard to move back in my 30s, but ultimately it was helpful. I could work part time, and at some point just do school full time and get myself on a better life track. I was living there during the 2016 election. Fox news on every TV in the house, rush limbaugh on the radio in the AM. I kept most of my opinions to myself, and made it a point to educate my son about critical thinking and that you have to do the research, you can't believe everything on TV, especially on a channel that is all opinions. It's not news then. I rooted for the Democrats, they rooted for the republicans. I told them that trump's build the wall was racist, and that racism is wrong. That his attitude about women was disgusting and no one should support that. Dad felt emboldened at the grocery store to comment loudly about Latinex people and their children. When confronted he said ""I'm too old to change"" I said that was BS and a copout.  In the end the emotional abuse that I grew up with began to spill over to my son when Mom told me she was withholding affection from him till he cleaned his room. Then backpaddled and tried to deny it when I told her she was being emotionally abusive to her grandson. I moved him out and to his Dad's place that weekend. I stayed. for a while. I tried to reason, use logic, get mad, argue and finally I gave up and I left. I lived at a friends place, rented space in her living room. Just to get away from the endless barrage of bs.

I thank my lucky stars that Mom never figured out how to use Facebook. She had asked me to set one up for her, I told her no, if she wanted one she had to figure it out herself. Mostly because they treat me as their built in tech support, I'm not going to sign up for FB support too. But she did find NewsMax, she said ""I like what they say better than Fox, something is wrong with Fox"" (this was around the time that Fox was criticizing trump) I would tell her that you are not supposed to like what you hear in the news, it's news, not a fantasy story. Also around that time she would call me, and for an hour she would talk about the Dems manipulating things and making things up about trump. I would disagree. try to fact check her, but the amount of lies were overwhelming and it's hard to do it in real time. I finally made a rule with her, a boundary that I no longer wanted to talk about politics, religion or my weight. To say in short, Mom is not good at respecting boundaries. I would steer the convo back to safe topics, but she always had to get her jab in. Tell me to not 'fall for the spin' I had friends participating in the BLM protests. Getting pepper sprayed for standing and holding signs. I watched the live streams and heard their stories. But to her they were all Antifa terrorists. I told her that all that they are trying to do, is stop the inequalities. Bring attention to an issue that is very real. But it does not fit into her narrative, therefore, I am the one that has been mislead. I'm believing the lies. 

Then I decided that I would only Email with her, no more calls. No more visits. It was too much for me to handle. I started going to therapy. Watching her go down this rabbit hole, believing everything that trump would say. Her emails also got hostile and cold. she would not respond for days and days when I had said something she didn't like or something that rubbed her the wrong way.. punishing me.  I made it clear. You don't have to write me long letters, but I need to know you are okay, I have power of attorney and I need to know that you are both safe and staying healthy. Mom is more worried about Covid, I got to her early and told her to listen to Fauci, listen to the CDC. Dad, not such a big believer, will wear a mask but thinks it's all overblown. 

I refuse to talk with them about what happened at the capitol. The only thing that has been said was after the election, after the insurgency, Mom telling me she is worried about what is happening in the country. Worried about what is going to happen. I agreed, and backed it up with telling her that there are a lot of extremists and that they should be held accountable for their actions, particularly considering what they did at the capitol. I don't think we were talking about the same groups of people. 

So is it Q..? I'm not sure, I've lost the people I once knew and loved. Their limited knowledge of the internet seems to have played in my favor here, I think. But Mom had not been sharing things with me from her Email for a long time, so I worry that she could be in deeper than I realize. I do know they are not the parents I once knew, not anymore. Not for quite a while now. It used to really bother me, now I feel mostly numb with moments of intense emotion about it. I'm just glad to see that I'm not alone.

345,I lost my son to Qanon.,"I'm new.  Just found you.  I'm so sick at heart.   I'm elderly but have my head on straight about the world as I have been a political junky for more than 20 years.  I'm not senile, I don't have dementia, Alzheimer's or memory loss but if you ask my oldest son, you'd think I have them all as these are just a few of the awful names he calls me.  He hid it from me that he was going to vote for T in 2016 for as long as he could but I'm good at smelling a rat.   It began an over 4 year long battle between us as I am a progressive Democrat and my son hates Bernie Sanders as he believes socialism is a dirty word.  When COVID hit the USA, my son was buying into Qanon BS and believed it was a hoax as his dictator told him so.   I have not seen he or his wife and kids since Xmas 2019 and it was very stressful.  None will wear a mask and I have cancer as well as old age.   I'm unafraid to tell it like it is so after walking on eggshells for months, trying to reason with him, sending him correct and truthful information he wouldn't even look at or read and getting nothing but very mean and ugly reactions, I resorted to dropping one word TRUTH BOMBS.   I'd just say, Dump Trump or Drop the cult meaning Qanon.   Now my son also has cancer and is undergoing chemo and radiation, I stopped mentioning anything other than his health.  Doctors say he will have a full recovery.   I am not so lucky.

I dismissed it as nonsense because the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine works the same as a flu vaccine does, it's not changing your genome at all but she hinted this doctor said it changes your genome.

another thing she's freaking out about is the adenovirus comes from chimpanzees

she just keeps going around watching these weird videos and quanon-esque stuff too

UPDATE !!

saw the video. The doctor was saying in the video she showed on her phone that the COVID vaccine causes ''non neutralizing antibodies'' to only be produced, causing antibody-dependent enhancement, so when vaccinated people get COVID 6 months later, they'll all die because the antibodies from the vaccine will eat their lungs and attack their white blood cells.",QAnonCasualties

353,Pretty much lost my father to this,"For months I've listened to baseless claims from my father on different political topics, where things started getting so heated that politics of any kind were banned in the house.  We just had the worst fight of our lives and I feel lost.  He got into all of this because he fell for some Iraqi Dinar scam a few years back that he bought into believing it will make rich.  I never paid much attention to it, as other than the initial couple hundreds he lost ""investing"", he never paid anything else.  Fast forward to last year, and I'm hearing him talk about things like Tom Hanks being a pedophile and how Joe Biden will be arrested before the 20th of January regardless if he won the election or not....which he staunchly claims he didn't still.  


Now he is full into the belief still that the election was stolen, that Joe Biden is not the president, as we are ""under martial law"" and the government is actually ran by ""General McInerney"" (I think I spelt that correctly).  Everything I try to say or show to him just gets tempers (both of ours) rising, and no matter what I try to show him, he counters it with ""evidence"" from the ""research"" he's done.  Even asking him to just stop watching the various videos that he's watching is met with a scream that he won't because he is a ""patriot"", and doesn't want ""communist China"" to take control.  He doesn't even care at the friends and family he is losing over this because ""if they were my friends, they'd accept I have different beliefs than they might have"", despite at the same time saying things like ""you are an idiot if you honestly believe Biden won"".

In most instances of relationships where domestic violence or mental abuse occurs, one of the first things that the abuser does is cut the victim off from family and friends so they don‚Äôt have a support system and so that the only truth can come from the abuser. 

I have to think that this is the reason behind Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and derision of the MSM campaign. Basically, I believe it was designed to alienate people from sources of news that were reliable. Once they had that void opened up, they had to fill it with something. And unfortunately, with a little nudging from Trump and Fox News, this is the rabbit hole they ran down. 

Obviously I‚Äôm no therapist, but this whole thing looks exactly like an abusive relationship. I don‚Äôt know that even if I‚Äôm right it offers any help as when how to help people who have bought into the conspiracy hook, line, and sinker but I thought I‚Äôd throw it out there.",QAnonCasualties

358,No end in sight,"I've posted here before, I am dealing with members of my family that are immersed in all things Qanon. One of my parents is the worst offender. We've had some pretty horrible arguments about their beliefs, spreading of misinformation and absolutely terrifying me with the ideas they have embraced.

I recently had to go home for a family emergency and spent almost a month being exposed to daily rants and pontifications over the theories my parent thinks are fact. They claim Fox News is watered down nonsense yet it ran, at volume, all day, every day. My parent would sit glued to their phone and laptop, wearing headphones and fixating on videos and forum threads/posts. There were times over my time there that I was clenching my teeth so hard to keep from screaming that my jaw would ache at night when I would finally try to sleep. In less than a week I was dealing with daily headaches, stomach upset and mentally felt like I was teetering right the edge of throwing a full on rage filled fit complete with visions of smashing furniture.

The worst recent topic is the Covid-19 vaccination and how members of my family truly, honestly, deeply believe that the vaccine is made up of literally ground up aborted babies. And, if you receive the vaccine you are not only injecting pure satanic death into your body, it is again all a hoax to hoodwink people into getting injected with tracking devices. No amount of showing proof on any level penetrates their barrier of brainwashing, believe me I tried.

Other long winded tirades in my time there were about the insurrection in DC (Fake, that was Antifa) and how the people that died were paid crisis actors. Also, as Americans it is our *right* to storm federal buildings and demand the the evil satanic cabal running this country be called to account, violently, if need be, people are sheep!

Holy freaking hell, I thought it was bad before, it is now so much worse. Especially since everyone in my family who had gone off into the Q weeds found themselves banned from Twitter, dislocated when Parler went away and now can't seem to get Gab to work with any amount of reliability. I have no idea where they were spending their days shouting into the void, but somehow they are still finding places to receive and share this incredible amount of misinformation. 

I have tried to hard to be optimistic about this running its course with them but I honestly don't see it happening. The hooks of this madness are sunk deep and even if whoever was or is behind Q is no longer posting, this thing has self-sustaining momentum now. I have to come to terms with the fact that I have lost them, they aren't coming back and even when they seem ""normal"" in conversations the crazy is just right there under the surface waiting to spring out and ruin everything. And they don't care because they think they are right. The internet/Q/YouTube/Random crazy a$$hole online said so, it's a fact and the MSM is wrong/evil/satanic/controlling our minds.

370,I Didn't Even Know It Was The Problem,"My relationship with my Mom wasn't the best at the dawn of 2020, but we were both feeling like we were both making an effort. August of 2020 is the beginning of the time I can actually track with text messages, phone calls and emails. Things looked idyllic. We were finally communicating in a non-toxic way. It was all ""I understand and I love you"" and streams of loving emojis. We talked about how happy we were that we were muddling through figuring out what a relationship between the two of us was like with me being an adult now. She told me how proud she was of me, I told her I really appreciated her understanding while I was figuring things out.

In October she watched Plandemic and wanted me to watch as well. I warned her against it, that it has been throughly debunked. She claimed the scientists behind it were well respected and world renowned. I told her that wasn't true, but I would watch it and get back to her. I couldn't get through the first 20 mins, and I didn't know how to say that. She didn't ask.

Over the next couple months she would send me weird/random text messages with no explaination. When I asked her what they were she would say ""Oh, I just thought it was interesting."" Shit like that Fauci was Mother Teresa's secret son, but Mother Teresa was really a man who was a pedophile. Bill Gates is putting microchips in the covid vaccines and it's the number of the beast.

Every time I would try to appear open minded and non-judgemental. I'd ask her what she thought of that and why she felt it was true. ""It's interesting."" Is all I got back.

December rolls around and it starts getting weirder. She texted this weird bit of disjointed text that makes no sense to me, my Fiance and his parents that was talking about how the Covid body count is not only fabricated, but because QAnon people are requiring ""actual proof"", it's coming out that ""they're"" ""actually murdering"" people to make their ""covid quotas"". She sent me more stupid videos that were obviously bunk, and I sat down in front of them ready to puzzle and write it out. Within 3 minutes there was TOO MANY LIES for me to keep going. I couldn't fathom trying to debunk 90 mins of this. I was overwhelmed. I was secure in what she had told me about us being patient with each other and valuing our relationship.

I made a really dumb mistake. I didn't know how serious it was. She's never been into politics my whole life. She hates technology like smart phones and calls herself a ""techy rebel"" because she knows so little about social media and computers. I thought she was safe. 

I started ignoring the stuff she was sending me and asking for ""my opinion"". There were a couple things she sent I knew were bunk and told her so, but instead of all that about respecting and wanting my opinion, she got mad.

When we spoke before Christmas, she made it clear she didn't think Covid was a real thing anymore. All I could think of was continuing to diffuse the situation and not ruining her holiday.

Shortly after that she ""randomly"" blew up at me about how I was ungrateful. A few days after that, same thing. I didn't make the connection then, but she had sent me QShit, and I had just carried on ignoring it. A few days after this she looses her mind at me over the fact that if she wants me to forgive her, and her flying monkey, they need to apologize, and uninvites me from her upcoming wedding because I'm ""being disrespectful"" and I'm not ""acting right"".

About a week after that I reach out again asking about the wedding, being positive and upbeat. I get back 5 pictures QDrops and news articles she'd really horribly screenshot with no explaination, 2 of her in her wedding dress, and the message ""excited for the wedding"". Within 5 texts she decides that I'm not acting right and snaps at me. I respond with boundaries, and she looses her mind and ""leaves"". So in her mind we're not talking because she's punishing me, but in reality, I'm done. This Q shit + her usual abusive, narcissistic, selfish, bullshit is too much for fucking anyone.

She blocked me on FB ages ago, but I made a new account to look and QShit is EVERYWHERE on her FB staring early December. I didn't understand so many times why she was so upset when we would talk, but it lines up with when she would send me this Qcrap and I'd ignore it. I had said I'd watch whatever, and I would, but she expected immediate results, and would guilt trip me when I hadn't watched whatever she'd asked after 6 hrs, so I wasn't interested anymore.

By the time I finally realized, (late Dec) I would say it was too late if she hadn't continued responded to my sound debunking of her BS with ""I just thought it was interesting, no big deal."" It had been too late and I missed it.

I'm sorry if this is disjointed or all over the place, I'm still figuring things out. I'm sure this all makes it sound and look obvious, but I can't stress how much it wasn't at the time. I just don't know how I missed it. I hope this helps anyone.

373,What is probability my husband will come back to reality?,"I just joined this group after seeing on 60 Minutes. I am happy to find this but now think I could turn into my husband with my head in my phone except over the opposite side of Q beliefs. Essentially my 3 teens would now be losing both their parents over 2 different sides of the same issue. Does anyone else feel that way?
I feel sick &amp; sad over this and don't think I am up to the challenge of learning about how to interact with someone taken over by these beliefs and bringing him back from the dark side. What are the stats on this being successful?
I had separated from him a few years back due to it not being a healthy relationship. But I came back home after 1.5 years away, as my heart broke watching my kids traipse back and forth between 2 ""homes"", then 1.5 years later covid hits and now my husband has gone off the deep end. I have a counselor but maybe need someone who specializes in conspiracy theories. 
I almost think I have to ignore this side of him; he gets that I don't like his beliefs (nor does he like my mainstream beliefs). I told him the other night we can't talk about this stuff and remain married and he said then we won't stay married! He said he would leave as I told him that I don't have it in me to move out again. So far he is still here and I don't think he is leaving soon as things have settled down. We cannot talk about these differences and I feel that is safest even if I feel like I am keeping my head in the sand.
Does anyone else feel like this; that in the best interest of the marriage and family it is better to ignore this aspect to the best of our ability? I don't have the time or energy to learn all that is required to help him escape from his rabbit hole (not that he is asking for help to be free).

It Is Done.  The Deep State collapses.  

 The official announcement of martial law and a legitimate military government, in effect since 12:00 AM on January 20, 2021, was made on Friday, January 29 at 6:00 PM EST (11:00 PM GMT).

 The official announcement of Biden's arrest along with 355 congressmen and 109 senators (464 elected) on January 24 and 25 was made on Sunday, January 31 at 4:35 PM EST (10:35 PM GMT - 11:35 PM Amsterdam / Brussels  / Paris).

 These announcements were made on the dates and hours above to all American media (televisions, radios and national newspapers) and to all world news outlets.

 As expected by the legitimate military government that runs America, as well as Trump and Qforce, this information was 100% censored by all official world media. The US military government knew this and wanted it that way.

 As with Biden and his party's coup d'eÃÅtat, the legitimate US government is allowing the US media to commit widespread treason by having them censor the legitimate government's official statements about measures of national security and immediate danger to the American nation.

 The media have all fallen into a trap. Now the legitimate military government can take over (provisional) control of all such media as dictated by law and the US Constitution. üá∫üá∏‚Äù

my mom started off pretty normal. she was always a little crazy. she had a really fucked up childhood and my dad wasnt the greatest guy so she's pretty traumatized. around 2014/2015 she started making youtube videos. she became part of the youtuber skeptic community and started really diving deep into politics, MAGA, all that. she wholeheartedly supported trump and believed every word he and his supporters said. it has only gotten worse. she doesn't seem to understand that the things she's saying dont make any sense anymore. just today she tried to tell me theres a secret government op to ""own the weather"" and control it and thinks whats happening in texas is on purpose to punish the state for voting red. she's not my mom anymore. i cant talk to her about anything that isnt politics. and im not one to argue. im almost the complete opposite of her but i never say anything because i dont want to have to sit and argue. i wish someone could get through to her but she just thinks everyone is an idiot and shes the only smart one. its killing me to see her this way.",QAnonCasualties
378,I tried to reason... Then I left,"I dated what I thought was a sane person for two years. He treated me well, but always kept something hidden. He is a divorced man in his early 40's, with two children (a girl and a boy). His ex-wife was less than stable, threatening me, harassing me, and generally making his life miserable. I thought his constant state of anxiety and agitation came from constantly watching his back with her because she would show up at his job, or drunk at his house at all hours (I witnessed this on several occasions). She eventually got convicted of Drunk and Disorderly Conduct, as well as Trespassing, for breaking into a man's house that she dated after he chose to end their extremely casual relationship. 

It wasn't until a few months in that I got a peek into his worldview. First, it started with the firm belief that the US never made it to the moon. Not exactly stuff to seriously worry about, because lots of people who don't hold horrible beliefs think that. It's not something worth arguing over. I dismissed it. It got worse from there. He kept telling me that I was blind to what really happens in government, in law, and in society. He was an ardent listener of Alex Jones and other conspiracy websites, purchased their products, and tried to purchase them for me. He railed against anyone or anything that challenged his ""correct"" worldview. He started following Q very closely. 

One day, he told me that people born on US soil are not automatic citizens. This was the first time I realized that he was serious about these theories and his beliefs. I opened a copy (one of many) of the Constitution that he kept handy and pointed out that the 14th Amendment defines citizenship as any person born in the United States. It's in plain text and was ratified in 1868, He told me I didn't understand the Constitution correctly. 

I graduated from law school, passed two different state bars on the first try, and practiced as a criminal lawyer. I know the 14th Amendment well. I am not, and was not, wrong. He used to praise me for my intelligence, except for when it came to matters of law. He didn't go to law school, he didn't practice law, and he isn't in any way an expert at anything. He chose instead to listen to Alex Jones, then Q, and other conspiracy proprietors. Soon, it moved on to questioning my every belief, bullying me when I disagreed, and telling me that I did not love my country or its citizens if I disagreed. He denied that the Proud Boys existed, and when challenged, just stated that they were true patriots fighting for the original Constitutional ideals. 

He berated me about Pizzagate (seriously messed up), the New World Order, and every other piece of crazy that came along. It got so bad that I actually asked him if he thought the world was flat. I got him into counseling, thinking that something had to shake loose. It didn't.  At this point, I already knew I wanted to end things, but he'd had major surgery and I was waiting a month for him to heal enough. He ended things before that. I gladly walked out and counted my blessings that I wasn't married to him. 

Two weeks later, he contacted me. He wanted all the parts of a relationship but to ignore our political differences. I calmly explained that his definition of a relationship is not what I want, need, or deserve. I tried being his friend. He got upset that I refused physical contact. I informed him that I am not willing to be his booty call. 

Then January 6th happened. He called me on January 7th to let me know that it was BLM and Antifa that stormed the Capital. I pushed back and told him Alex Jones was there, and of the hundreds of hours of footage of that horrible day, nobody once claimed to be a ""crisis actor' or part of anything but a supporter of the 45th President. He said again that I was blind, stupid, and I didn't know anything.

That was the last day I talked to him. I chose instead to walk away from the insanity, to save myself, and to stop trying to change someone who didn't want to change. I feel so badly for his two kids, who don't have a single stable parent. I'll regret forever that I could not help them, but saving myself became much more important. I couldn't write off the beliefs anymore as ""quirks"" or misunderstandings. 

I'm not here for praise, pity, or for any other reason than to tell you that the article in the Daily Dot made me feel seen and heard in a way I'd never felt about this subject. For all of you out there who are on the fence about leaving, have a go plan, tell your trusted group, and get out. They aren't going to change. They aren't coming back. They actively chose every single day to ignore all the counter-evidence and cling to a belief system not reflected in reality. 

It's like the airline instructions go, put the oxygen mask on yourself first, then on those around you. Protect your children, they are important, but in order to do that, you must protect yourself first. You do not deserve to spend your life justifying your belief that they are wrong. They certainly don't spend an ounce of time worrying about whether or not they are. Having to answer continuously for the new and bizarre theories they sprout is emotional abuse. Constantly worrying about what they will focus on next is abuse. You do not need to apologize, you do not need to isolate yourself or make excuses in order to not make waves. You have every right to protect yourself and those around you. Do not wait until beliefs become actions, because that day may come far faster than you think. Take a look at all the families and friends devastated by the actions of people who participated in storming the Capital. 

I do not state any of this lightly. I went through a horrible divorce 16 years ago and know what it is to lose everything. There are people who will help you, reassure you, remind you that you are not alone. I am here and I am one of them. 

For those of you blessed enough to have people become disillusioned with this movement, provide support. Help them get counseling. Listen actively when they tell you why they started down this rabbit hole. We are not alone and we will not be silent. Remember that no relationship is worth more than your safety and sanity. Again, you are not alone, and you never were.",QAnonCasualties

380,This is so unfair.,"Hello, this is a throwaway because I need to vent and I don't want this tied to my account or seen by anyone I may know.

My family had always been fundamentalist Christians and ultra-conservative. My mom was a vaccine skeptic nurse and my dad was always going on about how the royal family, Dr. Phil, and Maury were lizard people, how Israel and the United States made a deal with aliens, how devil worshippers ruled the world, and the fluoride in water made people obedient. My dad leaned much more into the...how do I say, ""Of this world"" parts of conspiracy theories, while my mom was the more staunch and smug fundamentalist Christian who went to every church service at our small somewhat cult-like church full of speaking in tongues, demon and holy spirit possession, and that ""divine seed"" tithing thing where the pastor tells everyone the exact amount to donate. And I remember them always being anti-government, especially while Obama was in office, despite all of the social programs they were benefitting off of.

My family had also always been abusive. They had always hit me and beat me as a kid and used their religion, mixed with heavy alcoholism, to make themselves feel better than other people while also justifying all of their shitty actions.

The 2016 election cycle made it so much worse.

I remember hearing about Pizzagate from my dad non-stop, Hillary's emails. All of that jazz. They were convinced the election would be rigged and that Hillary would win no matter what. And then came the great upset victory for Donald Trump. I still remember hearing my parents screaming every time a state was called for orange and waking up to their gleeful cheers that it was announced that Donald had won. 

And then down the Q hole, they went.

Every time I think about it I wish Hillary had won, and maybe they wouldn't have been so emboldened by Trump to spout their beliefs in public and double, triple, and quadruple down on their beliefs. Maybe I'd still have parents.

They went from what was ""normal"" mom and dad, to Qmom and Qdad. .

 They caught me with my first boyfriend(I am gay) when I was 15, and it got worse.

 And then I told them I was enlisting into the US military around my senior year of high school. Originally, they were proud, because Trump was the president and as commander in chief, he would be my ""boss"". It seemed like a win-win situation, I get to get away from their craziness and homophobia forever, and they get to be proud of their son. It was the first time in a long, long time I felt I had their true approval. 

I had moved out in May of last year before I finished high school. At the time, it was a big deal. . We had gotten into a few arguments during the summer and the fall, but overall, our relationship, as damaged as it was from everything, still seemed fixable. I could go to my mom for advice on my current boyfriend and in life and she would respond and help me. 

Then trump lost his re-election bid. I didn't even bother speaking to my parents in between the election loss and the inauguration. I knew the only thing they'd want to talk about. 

Biden was inaugurated. I had already signed my contract with the Air Force back in November. They immediately turned on me. My Qmom and Qdad started to openly call me a traitor, tell me I was gonna be working for the ""deep state"" and totally cut me off when I told them ""In the military, you don't get to pick and choose which administration you serve under. You swear an oath to the constitution and the government representing it, no matter who is in power at the time and no matter if you agree with their policy or not"".  Our relationship was already on shaky ground. Now it was shattered. 

I just can't help but fear that they truly will never speak to me again. It's been about a month since they went totally silent on me. I'm only 18, I still have a long portion of my life to live, and the idea of living it without parents is just so upsetting. I can't believe they cut me off like that. It's just so unfair that some random asshole on 4chan gave my parents a justification for all of the things they've done to me and made them okay with cutting off their only son. Of all things, I was expecting it to be my gay relationship that made them cut me off. They had made comments about me coming out for a while. Maybe they had been planning this. My relationship with my parents was screwed, but it felt so fixable. It felt like one day, maybe even years down the line, we could come together and love one another again. Now my hopes for a fixed relationship are all but crushed. However, boy am I glad that I had moved out pre-election time. It just seems so unfair that they would do this to me.

I just stopped engaging them about it completely and it seems to have faded away before getting too deep.

I know you can't ""logic"" them out of it but wondered if anyone was trying to pre-emptively ""make a deal"" with your Q person.

Let them tell you what they think is going to happen March 4th and then simply ask them, if that doesn't happen will you stop believing? Try to make a deal. Get it in writing or on video. Let the results ""convince them"" rather than you convincing them. 

Seems like that might be more effective than trying to convince them after the fact. Get them to start making plans and decide what to do in advance. BEFORE they can begin rationalizing.

I have a studio, no running water, but I tried staying in most of the day. He is almost fanatic about the Catholic Church he is a member of. It‚Äôs as if they also support Q.

She says things to me I could never begin to imagine a child of mine would ever say.  I'm considering therapy to try and process everything she's thrown my way.  She faults me for not having/carrying a gun, tells me I'm on a list as a lib and will be attacked once the war starts.  I try to carry on but see an awful lot of darkness in the world right now. I currently have no physical access to my grandchild, I worry so much but I have no legal standing.  It's not against the law to be a ""believer"".

392,Does rudeness lead to Qanon or vice versa?,"I have posted before about the person I lost, but I got to write about this situation at the craft store today.

I was at the craft store looking for a project. This is the kind of store that enforces mask rules hard core. No exceptions. This lady brought her kid in, no mask. Poor young worker had to go ask her to out on her mask, or offered to give her one. The lady said she didn't have one and would take it. So this girl gave her one. The lady took it, but didn't want to wear it. Young worker asked her to again, but when the lady kept refusing, she ran off. Now everyone is wearing a mask, even the lady's kid. So we are all giving her that look, but she ignored it all, just wandering around the store.

Now the manager comes over. He tells her she has to wear it, etc. Now she starts yelling. ""There's no law saying I have to wear it"" ""violating my civil rights"" etc. He tries to explain he is trying  to follow the state mandate, protect his employees. He is really trying to be reasonable and polite, but if she won't, she will have to leave. Then she goes full Q rude on him. According to her, when Trump is president again, he is going to shut down stores that force people to wear masks, and she will make sure he loses his job over this. It is sheep like him that make people afraid of covid, he just wants to control her but she won't let him. Her kid is almost crying. 

She finally leaves when he is going to call the police. How hard is it to put on the dumb mask? I mean, the store has got signs everywhere, it is not like she didn't know. Her kid is even wearing one. That poor kid looked like a miserable beat down puppy, wishing to be anywhere else. It seems like she went in looking for a fight the more I think about it. And to me that is so rude. I mean, the worker and manager don't have a choice. And it is a craft store, full of little old ladies.

She's a prime example of what it's like to be forgotten and poor in America. I used to regularly buy them food. She has no healthcare. Im constantly worried for her and my dad

But for some dumb reason she latched onto Trump and jumped into Qanon. She preaches about Charlie Kirk and how knowledgeable he is. She worships Ben Shapiro and the vomit he spews. She worships Trump and keeps swearing he is coming back into office. She believes Biden is drowning America. That he's taking welfare away. That America can't afford to give free healthcare because trickle down economics works

And the worst part? I can't even talk to her because she constantly argues with me. Its so bad that i can call to ask how her day is and she will bring up some garbage on Biden raping babies or something. I can't even talk to my mom anymore. I hate this shit.

400,I had high hopes after the inauguration that this would go away,"First of all, I‚Äôm new here, this is my first time posting. I have a loved one who has been deep into QAnon for 2 years now. Like most of you, my loved ones and I have dealt with countless rants about Trump, the Illuminati, Satanists, Democrats being communists, etc. After the inauguration, I was listening to a podcast where the host was discussing Qanon and predicted that a large chunk of Q believers would become apolitical, out of disillusionment and shock that the thing they were molding their lives around turned out to be a giant lie. I didn‚Äôt think my loved one would become apolitical (she‚Äôs always been interested in politics), but I thought she would at least move on from Q and some of the wacko conspiracy theories.

Ever since, she‚Äôs been adamant that March 4th is the day Trump will retake power, and that the barbed wire around the Capitol building is just to prevent Biden from escaping his fate. At this point, I‚Äôve begun to lose hope that she will give up on Q. Once March 4th comes and goes, she‚Äôll probably have a new belief or reason to justify why the mass arrests didn‚Äôt happen. I think the rest of my loved ones have the same view as me at this point, that she‚Äôll only let go of Q when she is ready and able to, and that trying to argue or dig her out will just lead to endless quarrels and drama that none of us are willing to put up with.",QAnonCasualties

Besides that, she has started treating me like the house slave because I'm no more intelligent than the ""sheeple"".

I have no outs because I'm on a different passport, and if the marriage breaks there's a good chance I have to leave my kid with my wife, with no sane supervision.

So I'm treated horribly daily, and I am a good husband and good father.

What crime did I commit against the universe? I would have killed myself, because believe me the abuse is that bad and I'm horribly disappointed in what has happened to my soul mate.

404,Long term grief and the posthumous casualty?,"This might be too specific to me, but I thought I‚Äôd ask. My father died in 2012. He was a boomer who had been a hippie convert to evangelical Christianity, become a minister, a die-hard Obama hater (his #1 argument against Obama was that he was only ‚Äúhalf black‚Äù), and Fox News addict. He also worked for an overtly political ministry and, unbeknownst to most everyone but a few of us, was a closet UFO and conspiracy fan. He was also a dedicated and gentle grandfather to my kids, and the best friend I ever had. 

Still, the last few years of his life, his rages at the left, gays, and immigrants had become more regular and more just... mean. He was only mean to people he didn‚Äôt know for the most part. I know that might be hard to understand. His diatribes about those people were reserved for his family mostly. But he and I did cross words a bit and he did once say we were ‚Äúdiametrically opposed‚Äù because I voted for Obama. That was so painful at the time. 

So, all prologue to how I‚Äôm feeling about this Q stuff. I just know, without any doubt at all, that my dad would have been 100% into it. And it‚Äôs made me feel shame and guilt that I am glad, in a way, that he‚Äôs not here to be a part of this insidious problem. And I hate feeling that way.

And:

410,I don't know how to help my mom,"Since 2016, my mom's gotten deeper and deeper into right-wing brainwashing. Trump is like a god to her. She has tons of books about him, a giant Trump 2020 flag on her bedroom wall, and a Trump bobblehead to top it all off. When I was 14 and didn‚Äôt understand the weight of Trump‚Äôs candidacy, this was hilarious to me. Trump was a joke in my mind, and I didn‚Äôt see how deep my mom‚Äôs devotion to him went. We‚Äôd all make jokes about whatever dumb shit he‚Äôd do that week, and my mom would laugh but always make sure to defend him as well. She was so invested in Trump‚Äôs initial campaign and I only saw it as a bonding point for us. Even if I didn‚Äôt understand or care about Trump, he was something my mom and I could joke about. For Christmas I got her a copy of Art of the Deal, and for her birthday I got her the bobblehead.

Honestly, if I had a time machine, I‚Äôd go back and deck my 14 year old self for fueling her obsession like that. I wish I could‚Äôve stopped it then, somehow. I regret it so fucking much, because since 2020, her absolute ***LOVE*** for him has been a nightmare for our family.

I‚Äôve gotten way more liberal since I was 14. I donated as much as I could to Bernie, registered as a Democrat when I turned 18, and voted for Biden without a second thought. So obviously my political views are in STARK contrast to my mom‚Äôs, and even my dad‚Äôs, though he‚Äôs less intense about his. I‚Äôd probably say that my hatred for Trump and Republicans in general is just as strong as my mom‚Äôs undying trust and adoration for them, because since 2016, I‚Äôve watched them completely destroy the mom I grew up with. I can‚Äôt even put into words how much I miss her and the relationship we used to have. 2020 was hell for us. We‚Äôd get in fights all the time, because she wears her views on her sleeve and I couldn‚Äôt keep my mouth shut when she‚Äôd go on rants about communism, BLM, antifa, and Democrats. I always felt like she was personally attacking my beliefs, and I was hurt.

Our fighting got so bad that my family staged an intervention for her in the middle of the year. It was fucking horrible. I never want to live through another night like that. My dad and I tried talking to my mom calmly about her addiction to right-wing social media and videos, but she got insanely hostile and defensive and started freaking out, which led to a bunch of crying and yelling from almost everyone. My sister, who was just 14 at the time, was bawling during it and was terrified our family was gonna break down. I felt awful, and I honestly felt like it was my fault. Like I should‚Äôve just kept my mouth shut during all my mom‚Äôs rants, and we would‚Äôve been fine. The next day, I actually went to my dad and told him I felt like I was toxic to the family. He reassured me that I wasn‚Äôt, but I dunno if I believe(d) it or not.

A few days later, my mom sent us a text explaining herself and said she was angry during the intervention ‚Äúbecause her daughter had to watch the two men in her lives treat her like that‚Äù.

My dad got the text before I did, and told me not to read it. Obviously after such a fucking weird and ominous warning, I had to. And I was fucking LIVID. I went for a walk and when I came back, my mom wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything. She promised she‚Äôd take a break from social media and come back to the family again, and we made up. But that only lasted a few weeks until she slowly but surely fell back into the same addictions and routines.

Regardless, she and I still managed to go a few months without fighting, though it got harder when her intense opposition to masks started to become more prominent. My mom wears a mask, but it‚Äôs not really a mask. She bought a fake-out mask off of etsy. It looks like a proper one, but really it‚Äôs full of breathing holes. So that‚Äôs pretty fucking shitty of her. She doesn‚Äôt even wear a mask around my grandma. HER OWN MOTHER, because it‚Äôs ‚Äúoutside so it‚Äôs okay‚Äù.

UMMMM? MY GRANDMA IS 81 YEARS OLD. IF YOU DONT WANNA WEAR A REAL MASK AT A STORE BECAUSE ‚ÄúCOVID‚ÄôS JUST A FLU AND ONLY AFFECTS OLDER PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS‚Äù, FINE. IT‚ÄôS FUCKING STUPID AND GROSSLY MISINFORMED OF YOU, BUT FINE.

BUT FUCKING ***81 YEARS OLD. SHE IS IN THE RANGE THAT YOU YOURSELF HAVE ADMITTED IS DANGEROUS. BUT YOU‚ÄôRE SO FUCKING COMMITTED TO YOUR REBELLIOUS ANTI-GOVERNMENT LARP THAT YOU WON‚ÄôT FUCKING WEAR A FUCKING MASK AROUND YOUR ELDERLY FUCKING MOTHER. THE PERSON WHO FUCKING RAISED YOU. I THINK MAYBE YOU OWE HER A PIECE OF CLOTH OVER YOUR FUCKING MOUTH AND NOSTRILS????***

anyway

I‚Äôd always gently try to nudge my mom in the right direction, but it never worked. She‚Äôd always get passive aggressive about it. Then December came, and we were going to pick out a tree. The night before, I‚Äôd read about how covid cases in our areas were on the rise. I was scared, so I decided to directly ask my mom if she‚Äôd be okay with wearing a real mask when we went. She got visibly frustrated and basically answered with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt own one, so if you‚Äôre so uncomfortable with me not wearing one, just don‚Äôt come with us.‚Äù

Never mind the fact that you could borrow one of my five, but okay.

I should‚Äôve responded calmly to that, but for some reason, that was the tipping point for me. It was like a whole year‚Äôs worth of rage came pouring out of me and I couldn't control myself. I started shaking and went on a really fucking loud rant about how she‚Äôd been brainwashed, was wrong about everything, and was consistently putting our family in danger. I‚Äôve never argued so intensely with someone in my life. It was fucking awful. I hated it. I hope I never feel the need to talk to my mom like that ever again. But the absolute worst part came after, when my dad came to talk to me about it. He was so fucking pissed. He told me I was ‚Äúforcing my beliefs on other people‚Äù and dividing the family. I told him they were endangering and failing us. I think about that conversation a lot, but I‚Äôve never talked to my dad about it. My therapist thinks I should, but I just want to forget it happened.

My dad‚Äôs on the same side as me now, though. Though he still sees covid as a non-issue, he sees how brainwashed my mom is. She‚Äôs constantly talking to him about how Trump is still President and is just waiting for the right time to reveal it. She‚Äôs funneling conspiracy theories down his throat, and I can see how exhausted and worried he is. We‚Äôve talked a lot lately about if there‚Äôs anything we can possibly do to help her, but we‚Äôre both at a complete loss. She won‚Äôt see the therapist she used to go to, because she knows the therapist is a liberal so she doesn‚Äôt trust her. She also strongly insists she doesn‚Äôt need therapy, and we can‚Äôt exactly force her there.

Today my parents and sister came home from a two-day vacation, and within an hour, I could hear my mom screaming at my dad about how he‚Äôs ‚Äútrying to keep her from having her own opinions and beliefs‚Äù. She‚Äôs been in her room since, and when I asked my dad what sparked the argument, his response really fucked with me.

Apparently she‚Äôd started ranting about politics on the car ride home, and my dad reached his threshold today and confronted her about how insane her conspiracy theories are. When we talked, he told me that he has no idea what to do, that she‚Äôs ‚Äúa different person‚Äù, and when I said I was really worried that this would end in divorce, he didn‚Äôt say otherwise. He just seemed so fucking sad, and kept apologizing for us being in this situation.

I feel like I should tell my mom how much her obsessions are affecting the family (she insists she keeps her politics to herself, but that‚Äôs clearly not the case. For fuck sake, she came home wearing a 2nd amendment sweatshirt), but I‚Äôm honestly terrified of confronting her about anything political again. I‚Äôve fought with her so much and so often, I don‚Äôt want to anymore. It hurts me so much to be in that position with her, but maybe I need to be there again. I don‚Äôt know. I just want my mom back, so fucking badly.

Anyways, sorry this was super long, I just needed to rant to people ‚Äòcause I don‚Äôt have therapy until tomorrow and I‚Äôm not close enough with any of my extended family to talk to them about this.

So yeah. Thanks, if you read this far. Also sorry for any typos or incoherent sentences. I don‚Äôt wanna proofread this kind of thing lol",QAnonCasualties
411,Losing Siblings to Q,"I just joined Reddit after reading an article ‚ÄúThis Crap Means More to Him Than My Life: When QAnon Invades American Homes‚Äù because I am losing 4 of my sibling to QAnon Conspiracies. I have been close with my siblings all of my life. We always talked about Politics, even if we did agreed. That was up until 2 and a half years ago. 

I made a joke to one of my sisters, after Trump made a speech on The 4th of July. In this speech he made a mistake and said something along the lines of, in the Revolutionary War we took the Airports first. I thought this was hilarious. So, when I saw my sister that night she said she had taken her kids to the Revolutionary War Museum. I said did you see the airplanes and I laughed. She got very upset, barely talked to me the whole weekend and apparently complained to the whole family that I make everything political. When I was confronted by one of my other sisters, I was told I should apologize. My comment back was I did not make it political, it was funny and I had nothing to apologize for. I did however try to be careful of any other comments so as not to create waves. Then came 2020. I tried to ignore the posts on FB and did not text my family much before the election, because I did not want to alienate them. After the election I started to get messages and texts from aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings about how the election was stolen and about the mass voting fraud. I tried not to be condescending with replies, but a person can only take so much. One of my brothers, who I have always thought was intelligent, texted me during work with this super long text explaining, with articles and videos, how there were these massive data dumps during the counts on election night. I did respond to say that these so called data dumps were in fact mail in ballots being counted, because of when each state was allowed to process these. I also said do you really think that the democratics could pull this off and even recruit republicans without anyone speaking up? He came back with those republicans are ‚Äúnever Trumpers‚Äù.  I asked that he stop texting me these things and while he said he would, he didn‚Äôt stop. 

I need to explain that I come from a military family. So, after the attack on the capital, when I had heard a rumor that this brother was at the Trump Rally on the sixth, on the 7th I worked up enough courage to I ask a question I wish I had never asked, I texted him ‚ÄúWere you at the Capital yesterday?‚Äù  His reply was ‚ÄúYes, I was expressing my 1st amendment right and I am proud to have been there. It was sad how it ended.‚Äù It was the first time in my life I have been ashamed of an action one of my siblings took. I received a text soon after from a sister, saying she couldn‚Äôt believe that I was upset about what happened on the 6th, but I was ok with riots over the summer. Again I tried to explain they weren‚Äôt the same and that while I agreed with protester this summer, I did not agree with the rioting. A lot was said on that text thread that I wish I could forget. She talked about how the US was on the brink of a color war, how she was tired of being called a racist for the past 4 years and that I should not trust the MS media. A couple of days later she decided she could not talk about politics with me any longer. This was probably a good decision. 

Now my mom has been back and forth on what she thinks of all of this and up until a couple of weeks ago she was going to get the COVID-19 vaccine. I had not really said much to her on this, but I was secretly glad that in this one instance she was going to do what was best for her. Then suddenly she changed her mind, my mom knew I was upset that she had decided not to get the vaccine. She told me that she had talked to my sister and with all the issues with the vaccine she did not feel comfortable getting it. I know what your thinking, my mom is an adult and can make up her own mind. I don‚Äôt completely disagree with that, except that this sister is in the medical field and my mom is 87, has congenital heart disease and is a breast cancer survivor. Hours after this conversation with my mom, I received a text on the siblings feed from said sister, informing us of the conversation she had with my mom earlier in the week. My self and one brother expressed that we felt it was irresponsible to advise mom this way. Then the four siblings start in on how the vaccine changes your DNA, the shape of your cells, that the animal testing was skipped, how the vaccine can cause fertility issues and it can be found in the placenta. After my brother and I asked the 4 to stop 3 times, they kept texting. It is almost like they not only have to get the last word in, but by doing so they are right. My brother then said he would be blocking us all so he would not have to listen to all of the QAnon debates. No one protested over this declaration. I sent a separate text to my brother telling him not block me. He said would not, but that he can‚Äôt listen to anymore Trump/QAnon ‚ÄúBullshit‚Äù. Even after that my sibling didn‚Äôt stop. One even saying C‚Äôest la vie!! I truly couldn‚Äôt believe that my siblings were ok with throwing one of us away!! Is all of this crap really so important to you??  How do they not see the truth? This was the last straw for my one brother and me. I stopped responding to the 4 siblings, but can‚Äôt stand the thought of blocking them. A week later 2 sisters texted me like nothing had happen the week before and the sister, that sent the text informing us the week before, sent a text apologizing. Saying she didn‚Äôt mean for the conversation to turn into what it did. She missed me and wanted to talk. I told her that I do not want to talk right now and that I don‚Äôt know how we come back from this. She then said something I find ironic ‚ÄúOur love is stronger than any government or disease‚Äù. Really? Did she not see the same conversation I saw? I have cried myself to sleep for the past 2 and a half weeks, not to mention the times before this, feeling them slip away.  

I am sorry for going on and on, it is just that I feel so alone with this and reading all of these similar story has made me like I can talk about it and people won‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy.",QAnonCasualties

413,Have to escape. Tired of feeling like an alien.,"Born and raised in the deep south. Many of my coworkers are full Q. People won't wear masks. They worship chump. I no longer have a relationship with my family. I avoid their phone calls. Our neighbors that we were once good friends with are full Q. A guy that was basically my brother is now full Q. Before this, not exaggerating, I would have trusted him to help me hide a body. Now I don't know him. Only person I've ever called bro and meant it.

I feel like the crazy one a lot of the time. It's like invasion of the pod people. Had a guy at a hardware store get so mad and red in the face because I was wearing a mask that I thought I was going to have to pull my gun.

People try and slide chump and Q stuff into business phone calls. Little feelers to see if you're a believer. Happens to me about once a week.

It doesn't feel real. I think I'm going to have something like PTSD from this.

Sometimes I ask my wife to tell me I'm not crazy.

My wife and I have to decided to get the kids, animals, and ourselves out of the South. We're going to head north. We've got four years before the next presidential election. We don't want to be here for another election.

I need to come up with a new career. I don't think I want to be a manager anymore. This has been sickening. Having to smile and be nice to these people.

We want some land up near the Canadian border. Have to learn to live with snow and cold. We want to live in a rural blue county. It's going to take money that we don't have.

There was always racism and ignorance in the South, but this is different. It's so ugly now. I worry about our safety, this how the Nazis ended up building concentration camps. These people are nucking futz and a lot of them aren't coming back.

In general, what percentage of former Qanon followers now realize it was all a bunch of BS now?  I'm just wondering when the right time to reach out is, and what to say, since it would be a little awkward to simply ignore that they unfriended/blocked me.  These are people I love and care about.

As an aside, I am pretty vocal about my political beliefs (centrist/moderate Democrat, absolutely detest Trump) and I know they've seen my posts and they are both Republicans who became QAnon Republicans for whatever reason.  I'm wondering given all of this, if I should wait longer or reach out now?

My stbx doesn‚Äôt want a divorce, but I cannot live like this anymore.  We got into it and he said he doesn‚Äôt care what people think of Q.  That Q teaches people to think for themselves.  

I (stupidly) bring up the fact that so many predictions have come and gone but things are still the same.  Wasn‚Äôt Trump President the last 4 years, what has he done to stop the Deep State?  He tells me ‚Äúthese things take time‚Äù.... of course they do *eyeroll*.  I go back to the dates never coming to fruition and now Q doesn‚Äôt post using specific dates as he did before, that Q used to write differently on 4chan vs 8kun and his first post about Hillary never happened. 

I‚Äôm sure he was shocked at everything I knew, but all I get is ‚ÄúDisinformation is necessary‚Äù.  So I question, how do QAnons decipher what‚Äôs false and what‚Äôs true??  What makes everything you (or others) think to be true and not disinformation? 

He says the posts are in codes and necessary to throw people off, to see if they are true Anons/Patriots. So, you‚Äôre telling me the same Deep State running the world for the last how-many-ever-years are easily thrown off while your average QAnon is able to decipher the codes and he posted on 4chan because it‚Äôs a free platform?  My Qultist is one of the most computer illiterate people I know, barely able to work a printer; and I‚Äôm supposed to believe he can outsmart the Deep State?  Not buying it.

I don‚Äôt know much about the tripcodes but highly doubt a top military official would choose to use that platform. He brings up people like Julian Assange, operation mockingbird or that Epstein was arrested, and that‚Äôs suppose to be the truth that Q exists? 

When he would say there‚Äôs a reason behind Trump posting ‚Äòcovfefe‚Äô, I knew I was losing him.  What do you even say to ‚Äúdisinformation is necessary‚Äù?  Just another thing to make me realize he‚Äôs so far in, nothing will bring him back.",QAnonCasualties

She said she's 'excited' for the days to come, because the Vatican has been raided and all the gold has been captured and America will no longer be on a system of currency, but live on a system of gold. That all of our debts will be forgiven in this new system and Satan will be overthrown.

She has always been a loving woman and someone I genuinely admired growing up, she was always a beacon of optimism.

After her cancer diagnosis in 2018 (she's cured now btw), she stopped working and went on an early retirement. This gave her a lot of time to pursue her passions and for a time we were all very happy for her, she seemed  to be getting out of that terrible time rather well. 

Now with the pandemic however, she's starting to talk about conspiracy theories more and more. She's at home more and just browses the internet for the entire day.

Everytime we talk it eventually gets to her lecturing me about how the government of my country is comprised of ""a bunch of leftist globalists"", how the vaccine changes your DNA and how men apparently aren't allowed to be men anymore. 

I tried to reason with her and calmly explain that the government is in fact not socialist, that more attention to the problems and needs of minorities isn't a threat to white people but she just doesn't seem to want to get it. 

2 weeks ago she told me she intends to vote for a party in our country called FvD, a far-right, mysoginistic cult similar to Trumpism. She started to dismiss any criticism of the party as some lie fabricated by the media.

421,European Mother into Q and guilt tripping,"Sorry if it‚Äôs long, trying to squeeze it all in! 

I‚Äôm 28(f) and throughout my 20s I struggled with the relationship I have with my mum. For context, we moved to London from Poland when I was 12 with younger brother (now 24) my mum and dad. They divorced shortly after and my dad isn‚Äôt in the picture for years. With her being alone in the new country, I was the first one who learned English, we had money issues so for years I would be dragged into translating council issues, calling providers, taking care of stuff, took me to court as a translator too, in hindsight I really shouldn‚Äôt have done any of it, it messed me up and I still go therapy to sort it. 

Nowadays, she tells me I never done anything growing up, and sweeps that whole chapter under the rug. 

Before the pandemic, we would still fight, mostly over me not being there enough for her and me gaining weight (fat shamed me for 5 years). She would always try to force some weird holistic approach, finding ‚Äúmagic cures‚Äù on Facebook. Magnetised water or some other bull. 

Well now that the pandemic is here, it feels so much worse. The London lockdowns are pretty strict, and I do try my best to follow the advise where possible. Definitely a household of science believers. My mum is not. She supports anti-vaxxes, believes in most conspiracies, such as the pandemic being planned, it not being as serious, even has weird Q believes where Trump is ‚Äúthe saviour‚Äù  and democrats are all pedophiles. (She‚Äôs Polish and lives in the UK, it still confuses me why she cares).

My brother also believes in conspiracies and they egg each other on. However, he moved to Poland in July 2020 so I‚Äôm the last family she has here. They both believe I‚Äôm the ‚Äúsheep‚Äù and they are open minded. I want to be careful about seeing my mum because I have had friends who‚Äôs parents died from the virus, and even people my age struggles with the disease. 

So now we see each other less, and she blames me for it. She thinks I‚Äôm an idiot for wanting to stay safe, and also thinks I don‚Äôt wanna see her at all. Just got off the call with her where she said stuff like ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt bother inviting you to stay at mine‚Äù ‚Äúyou do not wanna see me at all, that‚Äôs fine‚Äù. I was literally calling her to see her for a walk, but she didn‚Äôt want to cos it‚Äôs cold. It all escalated and I ended up in tears. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, like they are both super deep into these conspiracies, and there is nothing I can do to get them out of it. I tired since March 2020. We fight about it all the time. I try to change the subject often. I just want it to be normal, and healthy, but instead all I feel is guilt. I don‚Äôt know how to stop feeling this way.

426,Getting Out Of The Rabbit Hole,"I haven't been here before and I am a bit speechless to realize that I was not alone. I've read through articles just recently and it has been so strange to realize that what I was thinking/seeing/going through was happening all over. I thought it was just me.

My husband started talking about this back in March of last year, circling through the summer and into the end of the year, when it got really bad. I'm happy to say that I think for the majority of it, I've gotten my husband back, but I'm still not 100% sure.

Back during the height of the mess, I was in the garage on a few nights with him and a friend when I first heard talk about the conspiracy nature of everything going on. The pedophile ring, the election conspiracy, the deep state, the QAnon predictions. My husband not trusting the pandemic, stopping use of Google and moving to Parlor, getting into conversations on other websites that were unmonitored and uncontrolled. He got more involved in ensuring his guns and ammo were stocked up, his safety was secure and connected himself to resources offering me the option to go through gun safety so that I understood and prepared myself for anything. I tried to wipe my fears away and hide how strange it was to me, but it just grew worse leading into winter of 2020. Eventually I stopped sitting/standing with them as they talked and even though my husband grew silent and heavily involved in this 'world', he still remained open to me and worked hard, nothing changing that I could see that took him away from me. As I realize others did, I took on the roles of taking care of day to day things like bills, groceries, cleaning, etc. I was (and still am) working from home so I ensured to focus entirely on that, the current and now, to keep myself sane and honestly not have the heated topics in conversation like the ""COVID conspiracy"" or how the mask mandates were just a way to hold us down. I just continued to focus on what I could control. Luckily as we creep further into 2021, I am starting to feel a bit lighter.

There was a short period of time in the height of the election &amp; the following month that threw me for a loop, but I held on. I braced myself for this great awakening to only find that as time went by, life continued on. I saw that my husband stepped back closer to me. Eventually we did have a few discussions and I am mostly sure that he's come back ""down"" to me. He did say that he felt sad that he was lied to and that even though he thinks now that there are still things ""yet to come"", he realizes that the things he was told were false and he no longer believed in the Q conspiracy.

So now that I see that I am by far not alone (thanks to a post I finally found,), I know that I could really use to help through this and maybe I can offer support to others out there. So I'm here, I appreciate what I see so far as a support for people like me and I hope that I can safely say that I have my husband back.",QAnonCasualties

429,Final step is divorce,"First off, let me say that I am happy to have found this group. For so long I have wondered how many spouses or family members have been victimized by QAnon and having it consume a loved one. I will keep my story short. I noticed that my wife started staying up at all hours of the night watching conspiracy theory videos. This behavior continued to progress and consume her every waking moment. Not knowing how to handle the situation, I secretly hoped that eventually, she would make her way back to common sense; however, it only became worse, eventually culminating with her claiming that TV game shows were obviously talking in code to the other Hollywood elite pedophile ring members.

Feeling like I had no choice, I tried talking with her and asked her to see a mental health professional for unbiased advice. She adamantly refused and said she doesn't need to see a doctor. Also, let me say that she does have a history of documented mental illness that was treated and is a very successful professional. I had discovered the VICE documentary QAnon: The search for Q and had hoped I could get her to sit down and watch it with me in hopes of reeling her back to some sense of normalcy. As I waited for the right time to ask her to watch this TV series with me, she had woken me up one morning very early to ask me to watch a video. The name escapes me right now; however, it was approximately 40 minutes long and ran the gambit of QAnon conspiracy theories about how Trump is the secret world leader, the cabal, Hollywood pedophile rings, and of course, Adrenochrome and the torture of babies. I suffered through the entire video and then asked her to please watch the VICE series with me or even one episode, and she refused. It is so madding that at every turn, she has refused to come back to reality and seek help. Not having any further choice, I told her that if she did not see a doctor that our marriage was over.

I‚Äôve tried to be patient and let her try to figure it out on her own, but I finally blew up on her yesterday and tried to point out the ridiculousness of all of this. She obviously responded poorly. 

She has self imposed deadlines for when she would give it up multiple times. She first said it was when the blackouts were supposed to occur in early January, next it was the inauguration, now it‚Äôs after March 4th...

I‚Äôve tried telling her that it‚Äôs a cult and they will always have an excuse or reason for why their theories aren‚Äôt coming true.

432,The saddest post that I ever saw on the Q boards‚Äî the Great Awakening casualty.,"I‚Äôve been lurking on PW/GA/others for a few months now.  At first it was just because I was awestruck at their theories and conspiracies. I have to admit I checked the boards any time I would pick up my phone.  Without believing a word of it I still feel like I felt, to some degree, what they feel, some level of addiction.

And, at the time, I found the most interesting threads were the ones where people expressed doubt towards their own beliefs‚Äîor ‚Äúdoomer threads‚Äù, as Q people are apt to call them.

Most doomer threads don‚Äôt last long.  They get downvoted to oblivion, or banned by the moderators who don‚Äôt want a public showing of doubt towards their beloved ideology. But there was one doomer thread that skyrocketed to the top of GA, and it happened shortly after the inauguration.

I think the thread was allowed for a couple of reasons: first, a lot of Q followers felt some level of disappointment after Biden was sworn in and it became a place to vent. And second, because of the title of the post. The title of the post, and this is all from memory so it may not be exact, was something like:

‚ÄúWell, after 22 years, she‚Äôs divorcing me!‚Äù

The post was authored by a man who‚Äôd been married to his wife for 22 years, and she‚Äôd left him shortly after the inauguration because of his Q beliefs.  But what shocked me was that the spin he put on it was *almost* positive. He was trying to use it as a ‚Äúbadge of honor‚Äù of sorts‚Äî ‚Äúmy-swinging-dick-is-bigger-than-your-swinging-dick-because-I-believed-so-hard-that-my-wife-left-me.‚Äù

And *everyone* supported  it.  The thread was full of comments like ‚Äúyou dodged a bullet,‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre better off without her,‚Äù and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what you get for marrying a lib.‚Äù There wasn‚Äôt a single comment that suggested maybe he should chill out on the Q stuff for a little while, or asked him if he was okay.  Not one. I looked.

Then, reading through his responses to the comments in the thread, I realized he *wasn‚Äôt* okay.  And after rereading the original post, I saw that it was filled with thinly veiled panic masked by weak machismo.  And his responses were even less convincing. Stuff like:

‚ÄúThanks for the support, but after 22 years I‚Äôm a little worried how I‚Äôm going to fend for myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI actually really love her, I thought she was my soul mate.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know she was a leftist and I know how important the work we do here is, but something about this just feels wrong.‚Äù

And just like that, I went my fascination in Q followers turn to ash in my mouth. Like, fuck. This guy‚Äôs life has just been turned upside down, and the only group he can turn to for solace is so ass backwards that they can‚Äôt imagine *not* being happy about divorcing someone you‚Äôve loved for over two decades, purely because she a liberal. 

You could see him squirming in his post history. Trying to hint that he needed emotional support from the people he considered his friends. But it just wasn‚Äôt going to work‚Äîthat‚Äôs not who these people are.

It was fucking tragic and after that, I stopped browsing the boards so often, and I stopped being angry at these people.  I couldn‚Äôt get riled up reading their insane beliefs anymore because I could only feel pity.  I know a lot of people on this subreddit feel like their loved one is a different person, or has become crass to their affections, and worry that they may be gone for good. And I‚Äôm no expert, but to me, that guy who made that one post on GA will always be proof that somewhere, buried beneath mountains of insecurity, denial, and fear, is the person they were before the Q shit hit the fan.

But every time when i was using a quote from trump he ""explained"" it away like this:

435,So how many of your Q-people are talking with a robot in their head?,"Just curious, as this one has me thrown for a loop.

First, I was able to get my Q-mom to open up enough that I was shocked to discover she thought she had been ""having conversations with me telepathically for more than a year""!! (boggle!  üò≥üò±)  No wonder she seemed to blow up over the tiniest things - as if she'd been arguing with me about it hours per day for a year! 

I started to work with her, following a therapist's advice, by normalizing her need to converse, sometimes out loud, with her imaginary friends. At first, I made up my own inner conversation partners and occasionally talked to ""them"" around her.

Until after a few attempts at this, she looked at me like I was the crazy one.  ""You're just making that up!  Or you need to clean out your ears... all that wax crackling about.  Here, I'll transcribe what I hear and you do the same and we'll compare.""

""Um.... okay.... mom... gotta go um.... pick up some things from the grocery.""  Me slowly backing away.

""It's 1am.  Grocery's closed.  Nice try.  Good one.""

And that began the all-night conversation which led to me transcribing, with her help, all the ""conversations"" she was having in her head.  I'm pretty sure I've got a good novel's worth.  

Some she thought were with God.  Some Jesus.  And maybe some Men in Black super secret alien agent movie plot mixed in there. 

But once I started writing it all down to help her understand how to deal with the hallucinations better, I noticed a couple of things.

One - as a machine learning and natural language processing type, I immediately recognized the tell-tale signs of...  GPT-2 - and similar ""generative text"" systems.

I could even feed her things to ""say back to the voices"" and effectively retrain the model a bit.  And predict the outcome - great magic trick for getting through to Q-mom.

Anyway, it's taken over a year... a very strange one at that, but, although she wears her earbuds everywhere now so she can look like she's having a phone conversation if she needs to drown out the ""voices"" while out in public... apart from that, I think I may have my mom back.

436,Anybody's entire genetic line sucked in? My brother who has not been exposed to our family's conspiracy &amp; right-wing radicalization was pulled into a crazy group text that started with vaccines and has been going for 3 days. He isn't able to get out of the conversation. He's shocked at the crazy.,"It's not just our closest relationships, like our father but several aunts, uncles, and cousins on that side of the family. Almost all of my father's side of the family. It is insane and they are just rude I understand. Now nobody is arguing with them but they are all just sending group texts back and forth complaining about the Biden administration. They are all radicalizing, but my most radicalized cousin is saying that the Democrats are the enemy of the people and also that **a large amount of Republicans are the enemy of the people**. She says the MSM will get what they deserve and is calling for her family to watch *The Fall of the Cabal* because it makes a clear well thought out case about what's going on.

He's telling me, WTF? They speak in codes and their own language. Until now he never believed me about how intense and out of reality this stuff is. He's of course been accused of being sheeple and non-critical thinking and even being in a cult. I think he now understands why I've written these people off.

From the text messages, we are trying to figure out what **303-520** means. 303 is the local Denver area code where most of these people are. I Googled **""303-520""** and nothing comes up. Does anybody have any clue what this means?",QAnonCasualties

438,Mother &amp; Conspiracies,"TL;DR - mother believes in conspiracies around Covid &amp; beyond, consequences involving grandchild. 

I found this sub and thought I'd post my experience. The relationship with my mother and I (34M) has been a bit strained ever since I got married. We were always a bit snappy with each other and frequently had disagreements about how to do things - e.g. the way I was raising my child etc

Befofe Covid19, she was looking after my child for 2 days a week whilst my partner worked (I work full time).
When Covid19 hit, both my parents understandably went into isolation - they didn't see us or my daughter and ceased having her every week. We were all scared back then so this was fine

When things started opening back up in the UK, I noticed that my mum was posting increasingly erratic things on FB. It started with criticism of the government - which is totally acceptable, the UK gov were reckless with Covid19. Her posts then started to spill into posting ""doctors"" talking ""facts"" about Covid19 - things like death rates, cause of death &amp; why it isn't as serious

When the next lockdown hit (UK have had 3 so far) she was less tolerant/scared than before so went full throttle on ""doing her own research"" and posting it on FB. Laughably, the majority of things she shares on FB get labelled as missinformation, but this is of course a FB attempt to silence her. Things really ramped up with the news of the vaccine. She went into fake news hyper drive, the whole works of microchips and 5g. 

When Christmas rolled around, I decided to go round there and try to put all aside to have a nice time. She spent most of the day telling us various snippets of information such as how the Queen was really dead and the person on TV was a stand-in.
It all culminated on boxing Day with me being tired of the shot and asking her straight up if she believed that the government are trying to implant people with a 5g controllable microchip - she said she did and it was called nanotechnology
I called her crazy and said she needed help (a release of frustration on my part!) And her reaction was to refuse to have my daughter every week. 

Fast forward to today, she has not seen my daughter for 2 months now. We have not spoken to her for the same time. My parents have agreed to separate wherever possible, apparently they've felt like that for ages. Whenever my dad asks her to come and see my daughter with him in the park, she refuses. She doesn't ask after her at all. 
That has been the most shocking part of all this; this collection of conspiracy theories has in effect had a contribution to make her not want to see her granddaighter anymore. 

Some of the things she believes (so far) - maybe it will resonate with other people in the UK/world:

	- Covid19 is a hoax, perpetuated by the world elite (bezos,Zuckerberg,gates) to reset the population
	- The UK government are in on this and will be arrested any day via a common law uprising
	- The government are putting things in the water (she now drinks water out of a jug with anrod of charcoal in it)
	- That the common law of the land will soon overtake actual law via the magna carta declarations. She has printed several letters to barons in the UK pledging allegiance to them
	- That the vaccine is poison and has 5g chips in it. She has even gone as far as to verbally accost volunteers at vaccine centers whilst passing
	- She refuses to wear a mask anywhere she goes. In the UK, you're now challenged if you enter a shop without one unless you medically exempt; she has bought a special lanyard you can wear to pretend she has a disability and is exempt
	- She goes on anti protest rallies in London and Brighton. She has two new protesting friends she has never known before that she is close to

439,What I feared most happened :(,"Within the past few months, my cousin has gone from an open minded BERNIE FAN who wanted to go to a BLM protest with me, to a conservative conspiracy theorist. I really thought she would somehow notice the change and maybe take a step back, but now I realize this was an extremely naive thought on my part. The last straw was when she told me it was proven that Hillary colluded with Russia, I called bullshit, and days later she sent me documents (reliable enough, but nothing proving collusion on Hillary‚Äôs part in my opinion). She went through each document and explained it to me, and the last part she wrote was about how these documents are ‚Äúthe tip of the iceberg‚Äù and ‚Äú...when I truly put my head down and began researching this, I was shocked and honestly embarrassed that I was mislead and lied to by the media and others perpetuating it.‚Äù Is this not a classic example of how a conspiracy theorist speaks? I am heartbroken but at the same time, at peace, in an odd way. I knew this was coming so it‚Äôs not necessarily shocking. I was the last person in our family that was talking to her, and now the only person she talks to is her boyfriend, who I suspect has something to do with her opinions changing as he is a huge Trump supporter and sees nothing wrong with calling corona ‚ÄúChina virus‚Äù among many other bigoted views.

441,How I've prevented vulnerable friends and family from falling into the infodemic of misinformation.,"I've seen a lot of people struggling on this subreddit and many feel hopeless, but I've found a technique that gets results more consistently than any other I've found yet. It is r/StreetEpistemology or SE for short. SE has many advantages over a traditional debate. Rather than trying to convince the other person of anything it simply aims at getting them to think critically about the methods they are using to reach a conclusion. This will gently nudge them into considering how certain they are if a belief is true or not and to reanalyze their beliefs. It takes less energy and time than other methods, and is much more peaceful and friendly. It is also much easier to learn than most other techniques I've tried, and can be learned by simply watching/listening to others do it on YouTube and practicing for oneself, though it does help to read books and such on the subject as well. With time it becomes so natural one will catch themselves doing it without even trying.  


So for how this saved my friends and family: since the pandemic started I've been using my SE skills to deescalate confrontation, better understand the wants and needs of my family, and most importantly discuss the information my family and friends find about various current events. At first some of them were definitely beginning to fall hook line and sinker into the pit of conspiracy theories, and they still do struggle sometimes, but here is where my store differs from those here. After enough practice in SE I was able to get them to reconsider these beliefs more carefully, and now I don't even really need to use SE much at all. They will simply show me whatever new conspiracy theory they are falling for and I fact check it for them (and try to give a brief explanation of how I can tell fact from fiction to make them less dependent on me with time). They've gained enough trust in my abilities that we can skip right to the end of the debate and just finish off the misinformation. It is still very important that I remain open minded to their beliefs. I haven't convinced them I'm smarter than them, and I don't act better nor believe I am better or smarter than them (if I did they would stop trusting me). I've simply proven to them my ability to sort fact from fiction enough that they pretty much take my word for it. All information they send my way I treat as though it could be true, but give it the analysis. My communication skills aren't perfect but I do my best not to make them feel judged even if they bring up something wild, this makes them much more comfortable sharing and trusting me.

442,My Q-in-laws,"Hi, all. Unfortunately I'm stuck living with my right wing in-laws. It's wearing me out, but I'm coping. I was wondering if anyone else has seen their Q people reading and sharing things from Epoch Times? Last week I also saw the Newsmax magazine make its first appearance in the house.

443,How to pull them back when the thread is lost?,"I know these posts are supposed to be specific to Q- losses, and mine might not be a great enough loss. I cut out a lot of friends/family after 2016 when the rhetoric heated up. I didn‚Äôt expect to be tossed from FB by an intelligent, lively, articulate cousin when she became an anti-vaxxer, anti-Fauci, Trump-loving human despite losing her steel career in 2019 because of tariffs. Chances are she‚Äôs Q. I feel like her descent is directly related to 1. Free time from no job since 2019 (when the Mill was shutdown) and 2. A constant barrage of misinformation on social media. 

I, nor anyone in my family, knows how far down she‚Äôs gone. By Christmas 2020 she blocked all of us who disagreed with her. Is it that quick for everyone? How does it happen so quick? And when it‚Äôs the mom, (step) dad, daughter and son-in-law, two sons and one daughter-in-law (it appears one DiL is in opposition), and three of four grandchildren supporting the conspiracy, how do you speak to any party as an individual?

445,Simon Parkes Org?,"Hello - I am very new to this world. Reddit included. Please be kind. I wanted to find a space to talk to people in the same situation as myself.

Recently - my mother has been incredibly vocal about not getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Almost every morning she sends me nonsense videos about it. Talking about patent code 666, there's an ingredient in it called 'Luciferous', it will change your DNA, etc. She goes on and on. The videos are of no merit &amp; have no sources. The first one she sent me was of a Dr. Christiane Northrup. I did some research on her and turns our she was once a normal respected doctor turned kook in recent years. 

Now two days ago my sister tells me that my mom is into some ""Simon Parkes Org"". I, of course, did some of my own research on this guy and his website. All of it is completely bonkers. But I'm not sure if it's considered ""QAnon""? Is anyone else familiar with this 'Simon Parkes'? 

Like I said - she has been completely anti-vac for at least the last month or so. Sending me messages with crazy videos almost daily that make zero sense &amp; have no real facts. She also has made mention to me about 5G &amp; blocking it. Again, not sure if this is QAnon or not?

Quote she sent me in a message: ""I know you are skeptical and siding with mainsteam media and censuring that is going on related to the covid vaccine."" Sounds like straight QAnon BS to me. 

My sister informed me she also said: Trump is president and Biden is projected in a studio out of CA, All democrats are going to be arrested, new capitol will be in Texas, Trump will be renounced as the 19th president at that time????? I know most of this is QAnon. And mind you this is like a game of telephone because my sister doesn't live there either, she is hearing this from our dad (who is Republican &amp; a Trumper but thinks this QAnon stuff is going too far). He said she spends almost all day glued to her phone.

My mom has never been one to really be into politics at all. My sister &amp; I were vaccinated as children. She has never brought up any of this stuff in my 31 years on this earth. I am terrified it is QAnon &amp; I don't know what I can do to stop it. I feel like she's just going to keep getting more &amp; more stuck down the rabbit hole. This is never something I imagined she would get into. I have a six month old - her first grandchild - and if she's going to continue down this path, I'd rather just cut ties now. I'm devastated.",QAnonCasualties

447,It's Over,"So, I've been on the group a long time.  I won't repeat all the details of my Q-story from the beginning as it would be very long; you can read through my post history if you want the whole thing.  Short version-gay, with my husband for 15 years, 4 of them legally married.  I discovered he was in Q late last summer, although I now think he was in as early as March 2020.  He's gone the whole gamut-not just Q and Trump and Adrenochrome, but aliens, Simon Parkes, Charlie Ward, santa surfing, and all those grifters.  I don't know who got who into it, but he and my brother in law are also Q buddies.

I started therapy about a month ago.  I've asked Qhub to do counseling with me several times and he refuses.  But, with the help of my therapist, I wrote him a very long, very loving letter about how this has hurt me, the negative affects its had on us, and how I wanted to save our relationship and get him out of this.  The therapist coached me and helped me revise it so it was very, very loving, as nonjudgmental, and nonconfrontational as possible, and using all us/we statements, not I/me.  Just the way all the cult experts recommend.  I gave it to him on the 6th.  After a near 2 hour conversation which was very difficult, but we got through it, we made a commitment that he would drop all alternative media for 3 weeks-taking us to March 4, which happens to be his birthday (I know).  He claimed he didn't know anything about March 4 being the new Q date because he ""doesn't follow Q""-he's very good at flipping the script and gaslighting and using technicalities and such to get out of what I know to be true and making ME feel like the crazy one.  But, I let all that go, because I got the commitment.  He even deleted Epoch Times, Newsmax, and OANN off his phone right in front of me.

Since then, life has been really good.  We went out for dim sum the next day and we've had several very nice date nights since, and it felt SO good.  That's what hurts so much.   I knew he wasn't deprogrammed by any stretch, but I thought the process had started.  I saw real potential of saving my marriage.

Today I discovered that he is still watching videos in violation of our agreement.  He maybe made it a week tops and then right back to Q.  It's more important to him than me, our marriage, our dogs, etc.  That's it.  I haven't told him yet, but I can't take anymore.  He needs professional help and I'm not qualified to give it.  I'm done.  I haven't confronted him yet; I'm just too tired for that tonight.  I'm going to sleep on it.

Debating whether to do it tomorrow.  In another round of hell, tomorrow is MY birthday and we're supposed to go out for dinner.  Happy fucking birthday to me.",QAnonCasualties
448,Am I in the right place?,"Hi, everyone.

I'm new to Reddit, having joined today to check out QAnonCasualties, after reading a great, but emotional and sobering article about this subreddit, and it really resonated with me.

In summary, I have a stepmother, who is now fully bought into Trumpism. My elderly father, who has cognitive difficulties, goes along with it, though he probably is not as personally dedicated to those sets of beliefs. Our once-close relationship is now near the point of non-existence.

I'd like to post and discuss more details about this, and most of all commiserate with people in a similar situation. First, though, I want to ask if this is the right subreddit for that, as I do not know if they are into QAnon, in addition to Trumpism. If this is not the right place for that, I'd certainly appreciate any pointers to other subreddits.

450,How concerned should I be about by boyfriend?,"Hi! I‚Äôm so glad I found this group because I need some support from people with similar experiences. My heart breaks when I read about the broken families here, and I fear I may be facing a similar tragedy.

I‚Äôd like to get some perspectives on how concerned I should be about my boyfriend at this point. How can I tell when it‚Äôs time for an intervention, or if I need to get out of the relationship?

My BF is a kindhearted 60-year old man who was taken in by the Trump cult. He did vote for Obama 2008, but for some reason he became fervently anti-Obama after that (I‚Äôm guessing because of the social circle he was in). Knowing he‚Äôs life experiences, I can understand why the MAGA message resonates with him. I do respect his views, and he respects mine. But it scares me to think that he might continue to blindly follow Trump even further into the abyss. After all, Trump spouts QAnon nonsense, and he may become even more extreme now that he lost the election and was acquitted in the impeachment trial.

He doesn‚Äôt follow QAnon, per se, but is exposed to messaging that comes through in his newsfeeds (OAN, Newsmax, Fox, Facebook). I‚Äôm pretty confident that the most extreme claims would be too much for him to stomach. For example, he wouldn‚Äôt buy into the Pizzagate or Wayfair pedophilia lies, or the idea that school shootings are staged.

He believes everyone is against Trump because he stopped people from making money on wars and other political corruption. I have never heard him refer to the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù, though.

He hasn‚Äôt said straight out that the election ‚Äúwas stolen‚Äù, but does believe there is widespread voter fraud (illegals being able to vote, etc.). Still believes Trump won the popular vote 2016. He has accepted that Biden is now the president and says he wants him to succeed. But he also believes much of the ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù scaremongering. He called Biden‚Äôs many executive orders ‚Äúdictatorial‚Äù! He believes all the lies about the Biden family, including the one about Hunter‚Äôs laptop.

He often brings up the child trafficking thing, but I think he might have softened a little bit on that after I gave him some facts about it. The other night, though, he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like that guy‚Äù about Tom Hanks. I realized later it was because of the pedophilia rumors.

He railed against the violence that took place last summer, but says nothing about the Capitol riots. Early on he hinted that it might have been Antifa/BLM who entered the Capitol, but I‚Äôm not sure what he thinks now‚Äìand I‚Äôm afraid to ask! To be fair, he wouldn‚Äôt condone violence from any side.

He really hates white supremacists, though, and I can tell he's sincere about that. He says he believes that everybody, regardless of race or sexual orientation, is equal and should be treated with the same respect. And he is indeed respectful to everyone he meets. But on the other hand, he holds views that I find disturbing and are based on misinformation from the far right. For example, he really dislikes the BLM movement and believes that racism is a thing of the past. His view is that the protesters are asking for ‚Äúspecial treatment‚Äù, not equality. Similar thing with the LGBTQ movement.

He thought that Covid was deliberately spread by China and that the California wildfires were started by Antifa people (doesn‚Äôt seem to believe in human caused climate change). I think he might have soften his views on these subjects as well, as he‚Äôs seeing the Covid situation play out.

Is there hope for a guy like him, who is on the fringe of the fringe, so to speak? He seems to have a crack open where it‚Äôs possible to get to him, and he is open to hearing my thoughts. In fact, he specifically states that ‚Äúwe are not enemies‚Äù. But how could I tell if he‚Äôs actually more radical or closed up than he lets on? Could he be hiding his worst tendencies because he knows how I feel? I need some outside perspectives on this, please!",QAnonCasualties
451,A message to my mother,"I‚Äôve had this rolling around in my head for some time now and felt like I needed to say it to my mom. She‚Äôs fallen down the Q hole obviously. I wrote it out but can‚Äôt get myself to send it. Maybe all I needed was to write it down. Anyways, for context, the latest thing she sent me was something saying that the snow in Texas wouldn‚Äôt melt and is fake and is part of some Chinese operation to modify the weather. I thought that I could share it with this group:


That snow thing is so wrong and I‚Äôm so sick of seeing stupid shit like that being peddled by these idiots. I can tell you why it‚Äôs wrong but I doubt you want to hear it because you seem intent of filling your mind with this crap. And then on top of it you will not allow yourself to absorb any shred of logical information because you believe that anything that doesn‚Äôt fulfill your confirmation bias is a product of a society that is hell-bent on deceiving you. 

I‚Äôm putting boundaries on this. I don‚Äôt want to see any of this anymore. You have proven yourself incapable of vetting any of this information and therefore I don‚Äôt want to see any of it. There is no deep state-sponsored pedophilia ring. There is no Q. There is no elitist adrenachrome market. Trump is not the president. He will not be the president on March 4th. There is no financial reset. The vaccines are not designed to exterminate or otherwise control the population. None of this stuff has come true. None of it.

What there is is an imperfect world. Yes pedophiles exist. Yes people do some fucked up things. Yes some politicians are corrupt and have ulterior motives. Science is messy and rarely straightforward. And there are trolls out there that see an opportunity in that and take delight in seeing the world turn on itself. 

QAnon is a disease. I have joined a group of almost 135,000 people that is for individuals who have lost someone to QAnon. Friends, siblings, partners, spouses. And it is endless. 30+ year marriages ruined. Friendships alienated. Parents and their children disowning one another. People committing SUICIDE because they‚Äôre terrified of what they think is coming. These people have the same behavior patterns as addicts and it seems like there is nothing that their loved ones can do about it except hope and pray that they snap out of it before more damage is done. 

QAnon preys on people. It preys on their insecurities. It prays on their traumas. It preys on their religion. It tells them that all of their problems are from the design of a singular sinister force and then it gives them a false hope that soon everything will be over and some alternate reality will replace the one we have today. But it‚Äôs just that. False hope. The goalposts will always be moved. You will constantly be disappointed in the outcome until you realize that none of this is real. There will always be some reason, some plan, some story as to why what ‚Äúthey‚Äù say is happening, doesn‚Äôt happen.

This cult has built a self-affirming echo chamber around itself and its followers. Everyone is constantly searching for the ‚Äútruth‚Äù and shouting into a dark room what they think they no. Meanwhile any light from the outside is shut out. It is bad for you. It will deceive you. Don‚Äôt look at it, look at what we have to say. Trust the plan. Bullshit. That‚Äôs just a thought terminating clause meant stop people from applying reason and logic and emotion to the situation. It‚Äôs meant to keep them at bay and blindly following a leaderless conglomeration of lost ideas. 

I‚Äôve tried to keep up with Q. I wanted to stay informed on what had you in its grips because I care about you. But I‚Äôve taken a mental health break from it. Because I get SO ANGRY at the sheer fallacy of the things being preached and knowing that my own mother is right there cheering it on. And I‚Äôm terrified that this will come between you and dad. So yes, I am choosing ignorance and hoping I find some bliss. With that, I ask you to not share any of this stuff with me. I will not enable it.

456,Now that I've read a bit...,"My mom &amp; brother are big Trump supporters. My mom to the point that I can't talk negatively about him. She actually gasped &amp; said I was to respect him just because he was my president, whether I like him or not when I told her I couldn't stand him &amp; that he was NOT ""MY"" president.

I recently saw on her FB page that she ""likes"" Fox news &amp; Breitbart. I asked her in text if she believed in ""all of that Q stuff"" &amp; her response was ""I have my own mind"". (Not ""No"").

457,I have deradicalized my grandmother,"Definitely some good news on my end. A little bit of a backstory, my grandma was always conservative and she grew up as a devout Mormon. However over the past two years, I noticed a shift in her mentality. Not much I could really say other than she was spouting crazy right wing conspiracies and her entire existence became political. As a result, it damaged my view on her considerably. I always ignored her facebook posts, but a month back, she said something I could not ignore. She posted an image about Nazi Germany which was flat out incorrect on multiple fronts. Being the kind of person who hates historical revisionism, I took the time to correct every statement the image made and as a result, her conservative cousin agreed with me on that. This I believe caused her to go down the path of normalcy. She took a break from facebook and came back changed.

So I wanted to share this with you guys that there is hope and people can deradicalize. That is not to say that I think everyone in Q can be saved and in some cases shouldn't be attempted. These people attempted to overthrow our democracy. I think people should distance themselves from anyone who is advocating for violence, but there are a lot of people who are not in that camp and effort should be made to bring them back.",QAnonCasualties

My father was actually not so bad.  However, when I was about 5 years old I remember my mother rehearsed me on a script to make him out as a violent sexual deviant when she was going to court for child support.

Meanwhile, I grew up in a flophouse for alcoholics and heroin addicts.  I somehow graduated high school and immediately joined the US ARMY.  18 years old at BASIC TRAINING in the US ARMY in Ft Leonard Wood, MS was the first time in my life I was ever introduced to breakfast, lunch and dinner.    I'm 5'8 tall.   All of the other kids in the extended family are over 6ft.

460,My relationship with my parents is gone,"My parents have totally subscribed to everything Q, just without putting a name to it. COVID was invented by Fauci, Trump is a savior trying to stop Hollywood‚Äôs secret pedo ring, Biden is actually the devil, everything bad is socialism and communism, BLM was racist and destructive, Bill Gates is a satanist, climate change is a hoax, the vaccines will mess with your DNA, etc. Any evidence against what they believe is just ‚Äúfake news‚Äù or ‚Äúcontrolled by the mainstream media.‚Äù You guys know the drill.

I‚Äôm financially tied to them. I‚Äôm in college, and I‚Äôm very grateful that I‚Äôm in the position to have my school, books, insurance, etc. fully paid for. My parents are well off, not multi-millionaires, but definitely upper middle class. I wanna reiterated that I‚Äôm thankful to them for providing for me so well, but I can‚Äôt keep disrespecting myself and believing them when they say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt disrespect us (aka disagree with us), we didn‚Äôt HAVE TO pay for you stuff.‚Äù I guess they didn‚Äôt HAVE TO, but they‚Äôre my fucking parents. This is the bare minimum if it‚Äôs in their means, which it is.

We can‚Äôt talk anymore. Because inevitably something political will come up and my dad in particular can‚Äôt help himself. He has something medically wrong with his brain (I‚Äôm not insulting him, it‚Äôs true, I just don‚Äôt wanna go into the actually details), and his decision-making and social filter is kinda messed up. At first I would actively participate in the discussion. When they would make some crazy comment, I would do my research and then try to correct them. But, of course, it was never just that. One little comment from them and one correction from me would turn into hours long, heated, unconstructive arguments. 

My dad‚Äôs awful to argue with. He‚Äôs the yell-over someone, don‚Äôt listen, invalidate people with ad hominems, alt right debater. I‚Äôm not perfect, but at least I don‚Äôt say someone‚Äôs wrong just because they‚Äôre younger than me. You can point this out, but he‚Äôll just say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true!‚Äù even though it got to the point I would secretly record him doing exactly what he denies. It doesn‚Äôt matter. If he says it‚Äôs not true, then suddenly it‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm jealous that I don‚Äôt have that kind of magical power.

This came to a head one day when I left the room crying and angry. I locked myself in my room until my mom, who also is a crazy Q subscriber but not as aggressive as my dad, tried to get me to come back out. ‚ÄúI talked with your father, and we both promise to not bring up anything political with you.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt believe it, but what was I gonna do? Starve in my room? I want you to guess how long my parents abided by this promise. A day? Two days?

About three hours.

I left and locked myself in my room again. That was last year, and now I‚Äôm back with them for a bit because they needed my help with stuff. My car‚Äôs in the shop so I have no escape while I‚Äôm in this house. I was under the impression the agreement was still tentatively in affect, even though I knew they weren‚Äôt gonna abide by it. Yeah, I‚Äôm an idiot. My mom asked me not to get the vaccine. Absolutely stupid, but not political yet, so I stayed in the living room. Then gas prices got brought up. And then there I was. ‚ÄúFucking Biden did this. He‚Äôs ruining America.‚Äù I got up and went to my room again.

My mom knocked on my door and basically called me an over-sensitive snowflake who can‚Äôt bother to stay in the room when anything political came up. What they don‚Äôt seem to realize is that it wasn‚Äôt really about politics anymore. Yeah, of course I wish I could change their mind, but it‚Äôs not my problem anymore. Maybe that‚Äôs toxic of me for not trying harder, but I endured endless months of angry, abusive, gaslighting arguments that destroyed my spirit. I don‚Äôt care what they believe in anymore. I just didn‚Äôt want to hear it/get into more arguments.

No, to me at least, politics didn‚Äôt make me leave the room. The fact that they can‚Äôt respect me did. I don‚Äôt ask them for anything apart from paying for my school and living expenses. It‚Äôs a lot, which makes me question if maybe I DO owe them something. But no. They have the money to take care of their own child. They can‚Äôt keep gaslighting me into self-destructive states of constant guilt for this. 

I asked them for one simple thing. When I‚Äôm around, just don‚Äôt bring up politics. It‚Äôs not only for my own mental well-being but also because I thought it would save whatever was left of our relationship. They couldn‚Äôt do it because they respect Q more than their daughter. Maybe that‚Äôs not how they see it, but it doesn‚Äôt matter. That‚Äôs what I see.

My dad went off the wall that night. He called me a pedo-loving hypocrite. He said I hate black people (?). He said I called him ‚Äústupid‚Äù and made fun of his brain problems, even though I just said something like ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù He paced up and down the hallways, just yelling. Then he came back to my room and told me he was trying to inform me of stuff because I‚Äôm young and he loves me and wants me to be on the right side. He gets all his facts not from the crooked mainstream media, but from real people. People on places like tik tok and Facebook. At this point, I just nodded along and kept saying okay. This went on for 30 minutes, just him telling me all his crazy conspiracies again under the guise of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to inform you.‚Äù 

He calls me closed-minded, but I can‚Äôt tell him anything without him just flat out saying I‚Äôm wrong. There I was just being spewed at for half an hour. I guess I am close-minded because I just stopped listening.

The agreement is off now, not that it was ever really on. My dad hates liars and people who break their promises. He calls me a hypocrite and says what I did (vote for Biden) will destroy our family. My mom threatened to cut me off financially. But then they wanted to pretend to be a family again, so I was forced to come out in the living room again and pretend everything was okay. I was sobbing uncontrollably but after a few minutes I had to talk with them like nothing was wrong.

I don‚Äôt wanna type anymore. I‚Äôm just at this point disgusted and exhausted with my parents. I can‚Äôt escape both physically and mentally. They‚Äôre gonna keep regurgitating alt-right, Q bullshit, and I‚Äôm just gonna turn into a bobble head and nod along. I don‚Äôt have a real relationship with my parents. They‚Äôre right when they call me a liar. I don‚Äôt know that when I say I love them if I mean it anymore. It‚Äôs really hard. I‚Äôll be back to my apartment as soon as my car is fixed. Sorry for the rant.",QAnonCasualties
461,What do you do about...,"a friend or relative who is so far down the rabbit hole on this Qanon conspiracy nonsense that they *insist* that Donald Trump is still president -- not ""going to be"" or ""the rightful,"" etc., I mean: believes that the entire media is lying to them with propaganda reports and even ""deep fake"" videos. This now includes Fox and NewsMax as allegedly fake news, something I never thought I'd hear from the right.

I'm asking because my father can't hold on a two-minute conversation without railing against Democrats in Washington with all of the most outlandish conspiracy theories (this is in stark contrast with other friends and family I have who are legitimate Republicans with legitimate disagreements and criticisms of Democrats). 

Ironically, he'll believe anything reported that is critical of politicians like Nancy Pelosi and then refuse to believe something from the same source that is fairly universally agreed upon as the existence of ""President Biden."" 

This is someone who wouldn't attend any Jan 6th or March 4th protests because he is either too poor and too far away or he doesn't believe that there needs to be a protest for something that he doesn't believe has even happened ü§î I can't make the least bit of sense of his logic, and any request for a primary or corroborating credible source is met with a furious response...

I've tried steering clear of religion and politics with him, but his brain obsesses about these topics and they're intertwined in EVERYTHING he says and does. I'm not exaggerating about him not being able to go two minutes without bringing it up...

He was arrested for disturbing the peace and menacing but my daughter promptly bailed him out. For a couple of years, their speech has been laden with anger and they are the ones who know things and that we are demoncrates. They listen and revere Alex Jones. The incident with the gun, prompted us to change the locks on our house and stop all communication. Our daughter said we have chosen politics over family. That is true. I just cannot go on listening to the scary chemtrails that are controlling our minds, vaccine that will kill us....on and on.  We have stopped all communication.

I am more peaceful with them not in my life. Sure, we miss seeing our 3 year old grandchild but...maybe when she is older she can make a choice about seeing her grandparents.

If I do text back to one of the 30+ articles, paragraphs, theories I get a day (that I mostly never read), I get extremely triggered and angry. Like....angry, angry. So, I have told myself a lot to not allow him to ruin my day. To not allow him to disturb my peace, to steal my joy, etc, etc. But after a particularly hurtful text today, I decided to not shove away the feelings &amp; they quickly dissipated into sadness. I ended up just allowing myself to cry over this shit. Because it‚Äôs absolute bullshit. Mental illness aside. Maybe I would have had a few more years with him if it weren‚Äôt for Trump. Maybe it would have taken something in the future to devolve him into this person. Maybe he could have been an Uncle a little longer.

467,My Qbrother keeps trying to convert me.,"So, I already posted about my brother in the past, but for those who didn't see my first post, I'll tell my story again, and I'll add the new developments.   


My brother has been a QAnon believer for a while now. I didn't know but apparently he was a Trump supporter for a while too (he even voted for the Cheeto in 2016). In the last quarter of 2020, I created a WhatsApp group to try to stay in touch with my family through video calls since we all live in different states and countries. Everything was ok until he misunderstood something I said as me repeating some QAnon theory and he just started spewing shit about the satanic liberals torturing children to live forever. The rest of us were like WTF? but at that point, I didn't know anything about QAnon. Things got worse after Biden's victory when he started trying to convert us (my other brother who is an enabler who adopts an agreeing posture to his crazy talk saying ""well, everything is possible"", and my dad and I who just ignored him) telling us stuff about how Trump was coming back, or the big blackout that is coming. 

He stopped using WhatsApp because of the new privacy rules. On January 8th, after he sent me some crap about WikiLeaks through Facebook messenger, I politely asked him for him and his wife (who is a pastel QAnon who believes is an extraterrestrial being of light) to stop send me QAnon conspiracy bullshit. He simply just responded with a üëç.

Then he sent me more crap about the Pope being arrested via Signal. I just ignored him. Now he started sending me and my other brother (the enabler) text messages with links with more conspiracy theory fake news and ""experts"".

The problem is that every time I get one of these I get upset, I spent hours ruminating, I vent with my wife, who then also gets upset. I need to find a way for him to stop, but I feel that if I ask him politely again, he will simply ignore it, but I don't know what would happen if I ask him in a more rough way. I fear that if I do that it would create even more chaos.

The thing is that I want to tell him to fuck off. I want to tell him that he is using all this QAnon shit as a bad coping mechanism, to avoid dealing with the fact that he is not the young athletic free-spirited man he used to be, that he is now older than 50, has health problems, hates his job, thinks that his children are losers and that he failed as a father, and that he is married to a woman that he doesn't love. I want to tell him that he is repeating the same mistakes he did during his first marriage when he allowed a woman who he didn't love to make him believe in bullshit (at that time he even changed his religion and adopted all the beliefs of his wife). I want to tell him that he is not super awake now, he is just coping really bad.

But then again, I suppose that telling him all these things would make things worse.",QAnonCasualties

470,Gaslighting myself and I can't be the only one,"One thing I'd love to see more of on here (that's on me, so here goes!) is how losing multiple people to this Q phenomenon has made *me* feel crazy, has made *me* question everything, has made *me* feel like maybe I am the one who is brainwashed, am I the one who is stupid... because my Qs aren't stupid. They're well educated. In one particular instance, it's someone I love and and who I looked up to. I'm doing my best not to pass judgment or be too smug because I just never know what kind of crap I've been led to believe throughout the years. I'd take comfort in the fact that I'm a skeptic but it seems like skepticism is also the Quriosity that kills the cat!

It's become so ubiquitous in my community, in my industry that it requires serious effort to be around it almost daily anymore. I'm speaking mostly about a professional setting and I'm doing my damnedest not to out myself here, but I have to remain completely and utterly professional around Q folk, one of whom is distinguishing himself rather rapidly lately and being given a lot of, er, let's say *airtime* to talk about his views which he keeps very, very thinly concealed around large groups and not at all concealed around me and a few other mutual contacts on our team. I'm supposed to be strong and capable and not create any conflict around it in order to keep my standing in my field. It's getting more and more difficult.

I even had one colleague on our team recently who, despite my best efforts to conceal my disdain, reach out to me unprompted(!!!) to ""help me understand"" our Qolleague's ""point of view,"" even though she didn't feel that way and is *(or was?)* more aligned with my thinking on these matters. So basically I'm trying to be tolerant, because that's my job, and it's becoming obvious to people I'm even failing at that!!!

This is my first post on here. I'm extremely scared to even do that, I'm obviously a Reddit newb and I'm so, so afraid of somehow doing something wrong or saying the wrong thing, etc. because I've seen some really mean stuff on here (but not on this sub, thankfully.)

472,Fiance just admitted he believes in Q,"I am new to this as of 30 minutes ago, and I‚Äôm still in shock. Sorry for the length of this post. 

I am 51, divorced, and have been dating someone for almost 2 years. We have always had differences of opinion re Trump, but he wanted to avoid talking about it entirely to keep the peace. In the past 6 months or so, he has been getting angrier, quicker to lash out, emotionally distant, almost depressed. It was much worse after Trump lost the election. He didn‚Äôt talk about it at all, and blamed his moodiness on a leg injury and surgery that has kept him down for most of the last 10 months. I have been struggling to cope with his moods. In the last month he has turned into another person entirely. 

Last night he sent me a text asking if I thought we could get past our differences for the long term. I responded by saying ‚Äúnot if we stay on the same path...but if we can change the path, and you value me above Trump, then maybe, yes...‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond until hours later, around 2 am. Then he let loose with multiple very long texts that shocked me. I am not including all of their content for the sake of space, but here is the final part:

HIM: ‚ÄúConspiracy theories? Look no further than Russia collusion. All lies, never proven. I will support Donald Trump in the future, as I know he will have a lot to do with the party going forward. This is not a debate about him or if he will or if he won't. I refuse to live in a household with you or anyone, it would make me want to feel bad for supporting him. I know clearing well the election was stolen, you have a fraudulent president sitting in the White House. He will wreck the economy and send it spiraling, back to the old ways of Obama, putting illegal immigrants first over Americans. 

You will always be someone that I would say to myself, wonder what she's up to these days. 

And don't give me some excuse about an insurrection on January 6th. It's awful what happened, but those were not Trump supporters. They were actors, it's been proven, I've seen the footage. I know people that were actually there and they even said they were not Trump supporters. Just remember this optics are everything.‚Äù

(BACK TO ME) I woke up with this series of texts waiting for me. I was in such shock that I just replied with a question. This is the whole interaction that followed. 

ME: Do you believe in Q?

HIM: WWG1WGA

ME: And that means...?

HIM: Yes I believe in Q. 

ME: For how long?

HIM: Probably about the last 8-10 months. 

ME: Thank you for telling me more about yourself. 


No additional reply from him so far. What I have copied and pasted here is the entire series of texts from 2 am until now, with the exception of cutting the initial texts from him to save space. It is mainly ranting about main stream media. 

The 8-10 months corresponds to his leg injury, so I can see a connection between being cut off from work colleagues and the real world, which I understand is a starting point for many Q believers. The timeline of how I have seen him change for the worse makes complete sense now. For example, he never made racist comments at all for the first year. He was actually a great guy. Then he started with racist comments here and there which I always called him out on. Now he is calling covid the China flu and other anti-Chinese, anti-Immigrant and anti-Black statements, like being against BLM. He has called me an extreme leftist (I am a moderate liberal). This is all new behavior. 

He is an intelligent guy, and seemed very grounded in reality before, so finding out he is Q is such a shock to me. It feels like finding out that the mild mannered reporter that I thought I was dating has a secret double life as a super villain. 

I am sitting here knowing that this relationship must be over. I‚Äôm mourning the person that I originally fell in love with, not this new guy. They are two different people, and it seems like it didn‚Äôt take that long to make the transformation. I want to believe that there is some kind of sci-fi parasite that has invaded him and is controlling his behavior, and that if a treatment is found to shock the parasite to come crawling out of his ear (a ‚ÄúSupernatural‚Äùstoryline), then he (and we) will be back to normal.

475,Is my boyfriend's family going to get better or worse with time?,"My boyfriend's dad is slowly becoming more and more actively racist and it's getting weird. He's always had a certain bias - he was uncomfortable when his daughter dated a half-black guy for a while, but he let her and was polite and friendly on the surface. I bet he would complain a lot more today. He has one black friend at work that he's friends with who he said is ""one of the good ones"" because she also thinks the races shouldn't mix, and doesn't support interracial marriage either. And she's funny and nice, apparently.

Right before the Superbowl aired, he was complaining about how they only gave it to The Weeknd because he's black, how he doesn't like Beyonc√© because ""she's racist"", and she supports the Black Panthers which are ""the most racist group of all time"" (???). ""They were like the KKK but for black people."" He recently bought a Proud Boys hoodie the other day and he's been wearing that around the house, and said they had ""good ideas"" and that we should ""look them up"".

His wife and the extended family are somehow worse about it, so I guess it's not a surprise. She said, on one extremely memorable car ride, that ""slavery wasn't even that bad, it gave them employment"". About a year ago, she called her sister an ""n***** lover"" because she dated black dudes for a while. Sometime in January, she sent a qanon video in their family groupchat. It was a bunch of weird propaganda about the dawn of a new era on January 20th, how everything was gonna be different, and it ended with a Qanon slogan pasted at the bottom of the screen. 

Both of his parents voted for Trump (obviously) and convinced their daughter to do it too, a girl who literally didn't know what the word ""liberal"" meant until a few years ago AND who also had a brief flat-earther phase that lasted a good month and a half.

My main question is, are my boyfriend's parents going to get worse over the next few years, or is this gonna gonna fizzle out? Neither of his parents talk about it extensively and my boyfriend and I do our best to steer any conversation away from politics. Their house isn't covered with MAGA and Q-themed decorations.

Because my parents aren‚Äôt personally involved directly in QAnon, I get it that resource might not be viewed as the right one for me. My feelings will not be hurt if I am told that. I just thought this might be a good place to start and that someone might be able to give me some direction. I did read the rules, and it seemed like I could start here. I apologize if I misinterpreted anything.

People at risk are those feeling out of control of their situation and alone often with prior mental health risks or those triggered by the pandemic. The truth is believing in these conspiracies gives them a sense of control and waiting for and being part of hearing what Q's secret coded messages say/mean as decided by a few random ""reader leaders"" makes them feel they are PART of something bigger and that they are now ""special"" often when they never felt part or special before Q.

482,Lost one of my best friends to Q,"Hi all, I've been lurking here for a while but never posted until now. One of my best friends for years has been completely sucked into the Q cult and has cut off contact with me. What makes it even worse is that our 9 year old daughters were BFFs and now she has cut her daughter off from mine as well. 

She's always been a ""crunchy"" or natural parent, which I am also to a certain extent, and this I think led her down the rabbit hole of being anti vax. Then Covid came along and she was alternating between ""it's not real"" and ""it's no worse than the flu"", and completely anti lockdown and masks. (Ironic, since she homeschools her kids and hardly goes anywhere.) She really boarded the crazy train when she started talking about microchips in the Covid vaccine and following it up by diving into the pedophile thing and strongly supporting Trump even after he left office, plus too much more to list. She unfriended me months ago on FB when I told her she was nuts for talking about microchips in the vaccines, but basically all her posts on FB are public so I've been keeping up with them periodically. She quit posting on FB for a while (I assume she moved to Parler) and then came back right around the time Parler shut down.

I'm just really sad. I'm mourning her like someone who is dead, except if she had died I would still at least be able to see her kids! Her husband I think is not Q, he's always just sort of let her have whatever crazy schemes/ideas she wants while not getting sucked in. But I can't really contact him because I don't want to put him in the middle between us. I think I'm saddest for our daughters, who don't deserve to be caught in the middle of it all and should (imo) be allowed to at least talk online and play games together. Having it involve kids is the worst. :( Thanks for listening.",QAnonCasualties

484,Increasing Abuse &amp; Violence With QAnon Members | RESOURCES,"Hi all,

I've been really hesitant to share my story until recently because I realized my desire to stay private and calm for my sanity and safety is no longer worth shielding when it comes to watching people go through the same things I did. I was raised in a violent cult and escaped less than a decade ago. **IT DID NOT START THAT WAY**. They rarely do. They fade to violence to test a person's loyalty more often that not (several tiers up from the recruitment process). This is also where many people leave, but only after they see the impacts their violence had on their loved ones. By then, the damage has been done. Violence against the self is the common starter (they need you to tear yourself apart, become unworthy of their love and 'membership', so that 'you' can be rebuilt in their image) and then it moves to violence against others, both mind and body. 

I still have huge and deep scars on my body that remind me, daily, of what they people are capable of if crossed in the wrong way. This is all very familiar to me. I went through many years of recovery, still suffer flashbacks and dissociative episodes, amnesia, etc. Because I am well aware of this cult and how it's running the same course as many others that have become violent, I wanted to take a few minutes to share links to resources from the toolbox of some of my specialists that were shared with me. They helped me escape, stay grounded against attacks, and still help me with my recovery.*\**

Just a reminder to those that are in houses with QAnon members that have become abusive or violent (especially if you've chosen to not follow), this has **all** the signs of a dangerous cult. Just because they're friends or family does NOT mean they won't harm you. Things are done to a person's brain inside these cults, they utilize methods of 'turning off' empathy, they use isolation as a tactic to separate you from your loved ones (especially if they've chosen to not follow), they use a 'devalue' and 'discard' tactic to keep you within a circle of people 'approved' to socialize with, and so much more.

DIVIDE AND CONCUR is the main method, because if you're reminded that you love that person, you're less likely to 'turn off' the empathy that's required for you to then harm a person. We have seen this before in history books and it's working the same way. Denial will be your main coping mechanism to handle this, but it's also the emotion that will keep you stuck.

I just quickly wrote this out, sorry if there are any typos or broken links. I cannot talk about this topic for long, so I've got to go. Love to you all! Stay strong, practice your critical thinking, practice grounding, stay informed on the methods these cults us to recruit, trust your gut, etc. *xoxo*

Been a lurker for quite some time as Ive tried grappling with Q infiltrating my family around the COVID outbreak. Parents were birthers so them voting for Trump was no big surprise, the shift in who raised me was the bigger shock. 

Anyways, I used to volunteer for some non denominational churches (the hipster pastor kind) and recently saw a comment from one of the band members on a very conservative Outlet‚Äôs post and saying some sort of kooky things. It got me wondering: how much is Q being shared within churches like this all over the country?

She has had surgeries for precancerous cells in her IG and has lost 80 pounds in the last 10 years. She's not well and knows she's not long for this world.  We grew up Catholic but we all stopped going to church a while ago. She has recently ( in the last 5 years or so) joined this cult like Born again Christian ‚úùÔ∏è church. It's called Calvary Christian Church. I looked them up and found out they are like rhe McDonald's of churches. Pop up in strip malls all over the US. They seek out drug addicted, and people in pain, dying, etc. Anyway. This churches leader is. Qcumber and he now has turned his entire congregation into Q members, including my Mother. I am a Democrat because my Mom was. She gave me my values as a child. I am mixed because she isn't a racist! Now she says things that I feel are racist statements.  She is always angry and blames lazy people that won't get up and go to work and wanna live off the system.  She doesn't trust the government at all. She won't use USPS anymore because she thinks they will steal her packages. She talks about abortion all the time.  She had an abortion like 46 years ago. She helped me when I had to do it once during a very abusive relationship. She posts the crazy babay eater memes on FB and constantly wants to argue with me when I tell her she's crazy and those are lies. I have brother that is going to that church too. He's a Trump supporter, but doesn't act like she does. Doesn't discuss politics at all. At least with me. Could he be influencing her?

492,Thinking of giving up on your QAnon relative? Maybe try this,"I recently suggested some advice about how to use cats to deprogram your loved ones via YouTube and Facebook etc. [You can find that post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/ln1aql/deprogram_your_loved_one_using_facebook_and/).

This time I would like to offer an idea for those of you who are thinking about abandoning your QAnon relative, whether you have tried alternative methods to help them out of the cult or not. Honestly, you know your situation and your loved one best, strangers like me on the Internet can only speak in general terms and hope that our ideas might help. Take it all, try what you think might work, but you do you.

**The power of the Letter**

Indulge me for a second while I prattle on...

Years ago, when I was a struggling art student unsure what career path I should work towards and living on a diet of cigarettes, cheap beer and pot noodles, I considered a commercial graphic design path and did a little work toward it. My tutor looked at my portfolio and said 'You need to be different'. I didn't know what she meant at first, I thought 'Great, she's told me to completely change my artistic style', but she explained that the people hiring someone like me are looking through a thousand portfolios just like mine and if I want to get over that first hurdle I needed to stand out.

If you're trying to connect with the family member sucked into Q you're competing with a thousand online voices all yelling and screaming things that your loved one either wants to hear or feels driven toward. 

Chances are if you attempt to talk to them about this they'll spiral quickly into a well-practiced tirade, regurgitating all the posts they read that day, calling you a 'sheep' for not agreeing with their unfounded beliefs, comparing sourced and documented reality to what their Facebook friend they've never met told them they read on a forum and how that must be true because... you can't get a word in and if you could they probably wouldn't listen, because they don't want to.

You end up thinking you should just abandon them to their new cult, for your own sanity.

As I said before I was once on the side of abandoning them because it's too much work even for trained psychologists, deprogramming someone is A LOT to take on.

My opinion is that you should at least try a few things, and if nothing has worked and you can no longer communicate with them, finish with a letter.

And yes, I mean an actual, hand-written, physical letter in ink and on paper. Why? Because that stands out. It's personal, you put effort into it, it's not just another screed of words on the internet like this wall of text. They actually have to physically open it, away from their screen, away from distractions, and see the written words you have sent them.

They can't delete you, they can't block you, they can't shout you down, they can't run away. Sure, they could just rip it up, but you and I both know they'll read it all first.

**What to write**

First of all, don't attack them. Don't belittle their beliefs. Don't accuse them of anything.

Be honest. Tell them that you love them and that you miss them. Tell them that you're scared. It's okay to let them know that their behavioral changes have been frightening. It's okay to admit you've had to distance yourself from them for your own mental well-being or to protect your own immediate loved ones from what they've become (note: don't call them a threat to your kids, make clear it's about the person they have become and that your responsibility is to your kids etc). Tell them that you've tried to talk to them and it hasn't worked, that you've spent time wondering how you can help them to come back to the people who love them but it doesn't seem possible without their willingness to do so.

You can probably think of a lot of things to say to them that you haven't been able to without them cutting you off or shouting you down. **Just remember to be loving and understand that they are a victim in all this, too.**

Next, detail how your separation is going to be. Whether you're completely cutting them off or mostly distancing yourself from them you owe them an explanation of what this will mean. I would personally set a six month or one year time frame in which things might change and you might be able to reconnect again, if they've moved on from where they are now.

If it's your parent, especially if it's your mother, maybe suggest nine months of separation. It's not subtle but it could have a real impact. This could trigger the various emotional memories they have of carrying you and it might nudge them to remember what their priorities were.

Give them an opportunity to change. Don't give them a deadline but say you need this time before they make contact again, and that they should only do so if they feel they have moved on from the person they are right now.

You don't need to say that if they don't change in that time you'll be gone again. This is suggested already and writing it would sound like an ultimatum or threat, and that won't help anything.

Finish with a memory.

Think long and hard about something you both shared, a vacation, a party or a family meal. Try to think of something they can connect with, rather than something that you connect with and might miss the mark with them. Remind them of a happier time and tell them that you'd like to get back to that one day but you can only do that if they're willing to.

Offer resources for them. These people do not believe they are suffering from a mental health crisis, but they most certainly are and you're not serving them well by ignoring it. If nothing else it gives them an explanation for what's happened and being honest about it shows them that there's a way to progress through it. Don't come right out and say it, but just provide a few URLs for online mental health services or groups like this one.

I wouldn't recommend sending them YouTube video links of others who have left the cult, most of these are produced by outlets they will immediately reject. In addition, you're sending them right back to YouTube where the algorithm is ready to deliver another ten videos reinforcing their delusions.

**Stick with it**

You need to stick to this (unless in the case of family emergencies etc). If they call or text you immediately do not engage with them. Don't answer the phone. Block them if you have to. If you do answer you will probably face another barrage of abuse and nonsense from someone speaking entirely from a place of anger.

Engaging with them in this way will serve no purpose and will likely undo everything you are attempting to do by sending the letter.

The letter is you making clear that the separation has started.

You probably should block or unfriend them on social media. They'll have a desire to lash out and be vindictive at least for a while. It would be better if you don't give them that opportunity and you absolutely must not respond no matter how much they might try to bait you into it.

Ultimately if they can't scream at you on Facebook or send you a hundred text messages they might resort to replying by letter. This is okay. They'll probably go through ten drafts starting with a screed of rage before resorting to something more rational. Depending on your loved one it might be possible to continue writing letters, but I think in most cases you'll find yourself throwing them away or just not wanting to open them.

Don't let them simply move the abusive relationship from Facebook to USPS. Hold your ground and if they start writing you letters filled with conspiracy theories and emotional blackmail stop opening them, write on the back 'contact me in 9 months' (or whatever time you initially set) and send them back unopened.

Your relative might make contact after only a week, or a month, and say they're done with Q. I don't mean to sound harsh but you probably shouldn't believe them. A lot of these vulnerable people will want both worlds and believe 'they can change' (seem familiar?)

The truth is that change takes work, will power and the use of available resources. They probably haven't truly attempted to move on at all and just want things to continue the way they were when you were unhappy and scared to be around them.

Stick to what you set out in the letter.

**In conclusion**

Writing letters takes time, it takes thought and effort. A fast paced argument by text or over the phone takes no time at all and allows for things to be said that are coming from a place of anger rather than genuine considered opinion or long-standing emotion.

It's harder to ignore a letter.

It's near impossible to resist opening and reading every word.

It might work. They might get in touch again when you've suggested it and be an entirely different person. A lot of former Q adherents are seeking therapy. Many have left the cult. The social network landscape is changing and it is making it harder for these factions to indoctrinate new people.

The pandemic will end and we will start getting back to our lives and filling our time with worthwhile things and it's likely that as that happens your relative will start to realize what they've done to their relationships.

Think about it, when life starts getting back to normal and they begin thinking about going out to dinner, hosting a party or going on vacation, they'll probably realize how many people they've lost.

Always be there for the loved one who gets out. It might not be tomorrow, it might not be in 9 months, it might take another 3 years, but be ready to welcome them back when they finally see the light.

494,My Qmother just disowned me,"I live in an area that is hit hard by the pandemic. Yesterday in a text, my Qmother asked me if I've had the vaccine. I told her that I haven't yet and I asked if she has. She tells me that she isn't going to get the vaccine because it ""messes with \[your\] genetic code"" and asked me to please not get it. This made me so angry because 1) during the summer she cried in a group text about how she's going to die if she gets covid; 2) she works in a nursing home; and 3) the misinformation she believes in is dangerous because it puts herself and others at risk. I also knew it wasn't worth debating with her anymore since she's not open to new information, she never listens to me anyway, and she's just going to gaslight me like she always does.  

 I told her:

&gt;Are you doing this for attention? Validation? You should know by now that I'm not going to validate your QAnon conspiracy theories. I take these issues very seriously, but there's no point in debating if you're totally committed to your beliefs despite all the evidence. I know you're aware the virus can be deadly, so I hope you would do what you can to keep yourself and others safe by getting vaccinated.

I had to set a boundary and I wanted to bring attention to the motivations for her behavior. She has a   
 history of exploiting me for emotional validation and I refuse to play that role for her. Predictably, I knew she would get mad. I just didn't expect her to literally disown me lol.

This is how she responded (all in text messages):

&gt;What the hell did you respond to my question like this for? Who do you think you are talking to??  
&gt;  
&gt;I am your mother, I can be concerned for you because I happen to love and care for you  
&gt;  
&gt;This reponse is bull shit! Ppl at my work are having reactions that are sending them to the hospital!  
&gt;  
&gt;Why do you think I asked you. So you can come at me with angry accusations?  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I'm a conspiracy theorist?  
&gt;  
&gt;You know, forget I'm your mother. That is what your color revolution socialist agenda does anyways. I feel sorry for you, you will be in for a terrible shock. And you know what I think, you'd turn your own family in to the Gestapo. Welcome to the ONE WORLD ORDER. I will pray for the redemption of your soul. Don't call me.

Now that I've gotten over the initial anger and hurt left by her comments, I just find them really funny in their absurdity. She even made an Instagram post that's passive-aggressively directed at me. It shows an image with text that says, ""I hate when people confuse education with intelligence. You can have a degree and still be an idiot"" (I have two degrees). The caption says ""Socialism or Communism is SATANISM. Get that straight! Elitist!"" (I'm a socialist.) In the comments she wrote, ""Don't get me started! I'm at an age where I don't give a shit what anyone thinks! You can go fuck yourself!"" I seem to have really struck a nerve lol.",QAnonCasualties

Source: freejoy.aimoo.com  
What is the eternal God of creation, eternal the way Tao (in taoism)?  
What is the character of the savior Messiah Mahdi Maitreya Buddha, and how to find him/her?

I as the real savior Messiah Buddha will give you the correct answer, whether you can understand it or not is another question.

The big mistakes top secret controllers, secret societies are making is that they do not simply understand the eternal God.  
The   secret controllers here I mean those are the ‚ÄúGods‚Äù and entities who   are really control the shadow government in many nations, as long as the   ‚Äúreferee‚Äù as well.

They  only  think the savior Messiah Buddha is a being with super power, super   abilities just like in the movie ‚ÄúJourney In The West‚Äù.  
They  are so  wrong because the savior Messiah Buddha is the one who fully  understand  the God of creation, the eternal Tao (in taoism).  
They do not believe a mortal human with no super power or super abilities is ‚Äúabove level‚Äù them.

The   eternal God of all creation has no image, no sound, is exist beyond  any  eye can see. (you can verify it in many sacred books)  
**It is a correct theory in mind.**

But   all those stupid secret controllers, societies are expecting a being   with super power, super abilities for them to see in real eyes, which   mean is not the real eternal God of creation.

If   you need an explanation of why you guys are still struggle with level   3, 4 or 5 in ‚Äúcultivate divine neutral energy‚Äù), then the answer is not   lack of guide but the true is that you guys do not have the correct   theory about the eternal God in your mind.  
Some westerner people may not understand what I am talking about but the East will understand it.  
Those   groups are the one who secret helped small nations like China,  Vietnam,  North Korea win against the USA, France, Japan in physical  weapon  battle war.

The eternal   power of any beings is correct theory about the eternal God, but not   physical power, super abilities. The super power super abilities is just   like the clothes.

If you  need  any ‚Äúsuper power‚Äù to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù or to ‚Äúhold‚Äù anything such as door,  gate,  swords, then all you need to do is make a fair amount of donation  to  me, then make a request in detail of how you going to use, the  timing,  etc. Then all you need to do is use smartphone, open the  conversation  with me ¬†and show that to that ‚Äúlegendary weapon/gate‚Äù  before ‚Äúmake  your action‚Äù.

Or  if you have any  connection with super natural beings and want to verify  whether my real  eternal God power is stronger than you guys (who have  activated super  abilities power), you can use that similar method.

Stop saying everybody can talk, all are just theory.  
If   you want to ‚Äúgambling‚Äù your own life, I willing to ‚Äúplay‚Äù with you  guys  under the observe of a super power being such as Lord Shiva.

The truth of life, the truth of creation is that simple but hard to understand.

I   share this information like a last warning for you guys to stop those   stupid actions, the time of much more super powerful beings re-enter  the  game of life is comming very soon (less than 100 days from now). If  any  of you (the secret controllers) vanished by unknown reason, then  you  guys can only blame yourself.

Feel free to send this article to top secret controllers, secret societies for them to wake up before too late.

499,February 22nd.,"Well, we are fast approaching February 22nd. The date that my Q (former) friend told me would be the day that she would come back and apologize to me if ""The Storm"" didn't happen by then...

I am well aware that a lot of Qcultists think that Trump will be Inaugurated on March 4th ect ect. I'm not sure why she threw out February 22nd as the date that mattered.

I do know that literally nothing will happen. On February 22nd or March 4th or any date inbetween. 

I don't know what the goal post will be moved to after that date, however I am sure that it will be moved. 

I also know that there is no way that she will seek me out and apologize for calling me a fool and a DemonRat and whatever else, due to me not beleiving in Q insanity ect 

And I know that i sure as hell wont seek her out to remind her of it either. She said this to me in writing, that February 22nd would be the magical day. I have a screenshot. That I will do nothing with. 

Its not worth it.

She used to be someone who was a left wing libertarian. Then she started to tip toe to the right. During Covid, she started to post some odd stuff. She would post about Epstein and this cabal of celebrities and politicians who traffick babies. She would talk about how we shouldn‚Äôt believe any media since it‚Äôs organized to lie to us. She posted stuff from Alex Jones and when my dad, someone who was also friends with her, pointed out that Alex Jones isn‚Äôt reliable information, she unfriended him. This one day she posted on instagram of her face painted with symbols, and the caption was talking about how she will help destroy the evil forces hurting children. She would talk about how she was awakened and everyone else was blind.
Recently she posted something about Mark Zuckerberg being a reptile. I pointed out that calling a Jewish person a reptile is extremely anti-semitic and is rooted in far right propaganda. She replied saying that her belief of a reptilian race that planted seeds for civilizations predates any organized religion, so she wouldn‚Äôt stop calling him a reptile.

Q: so I noticed the hooters over by X went out of business. And then I saw they're putting something new in there. Which is weird. 

Me: I mean restaurant spaces are generally taken over by new restaurants due to the equipment and layout and stuff. 

Q: then I noticed that a new comedy bar is opening up.

Me: that's actually really cool...

Q: but it's in the middle of a ""pandemic"" restaurants are going under with this shutdown. Who is investing in restaurants???

Me: well lots of people fund their own restaurants, plus there are lots of grants and loans out there right now...

Q: no no no, these people have some kind of knowledge. Stuff the rest of us don't know about. Some kind of plan we aren't in on.

Me: COMPLETELY changes the subject and quickly ends conversation

Knowledge? Like the knowledge that there's a fucking vaccine? Like the knowledge that shit is already opening back up again? Like the fact that restaurants constantly open, fail, and close. Or open and succeed? Or knowledge like the fact that Hooters has always been mediocre and when people door dash food it's not going to be fucking Hooters!?!

After 24 hours and more stitches than anyone cared to count - all she said was, ""well, I guess I will never call you a hypochondric again.""

However, my relationship with my Dad has always been closer. We are just on the same wave length. We have always been able to talk about political things - even when we disagreed. We respected each other and always kept it on an intellectual level. As I moved more and more to the left - things remained the same. Until the last few months.

I have lost several friends to Trumpism and to Q. All were normal average 'center/left or center/right' in their politics.

Over the last 3 years I've learned that there are really only two approaches. The first requires a huge amount of time and 'deprogramming' and can't really be done from a distance. It requires cutting them off from the constant flow of lies through (mostly) online media they consume, and cutting off the communities they join, especially facebook groups.

The other approach is difficult, but the only way for relationships that are less formal, like friendships. You have to cut them out of your life. Accept that there is no longer room in your life for them and move on. I know it sounds harsh, but it's the only thing I've found works for more loosely bound relationships, and often close ones, like family, as well.

Why can't you just shake them out of it and make them see how insane they sound and act?

The reason is that Q is not just recycling lies from a century ago that also took hold then (and still lingers), it also uses cult formation techniques that make it particularly attractive to the way humans process information. It's inclusive, and flexible, with a base set of beliefs so people have 'a truth' what they call The Plan, but also allows them to make it their own (i.e. making up a conspiracy theory like Democrats are manipulating the weather in texas) and it's a self reinforcing community amplified by social media groups (not unlike this one, but for evil).

I'd like to think I'm wrong on this, but after dealing with half a dozen relationships (family, friends and S.O.), I don't think there's any other ways to fix it.

My heart goes out to all of you suffering through what's, for many, horrible loss. I know the feeling well. It's not unlike having that person die in some ways and, sadly, I think we have to treat it that way.

Some of them may eventually come back, many will morph into some other extreme belief system (I suspect many will end up in edge-case evangelical churches over time), but they're effectively gone. I'm so sorry if reading this and believing it to be true (as I do) hurts. I wish I'd know this 3 years ago though, so, I‚Äôm putting it here for people to take or leave as they see fit.

Also will have mentions of homophobia and abortion.  I'm open to Advice but mostly venting

My family is full of very kind, but emotionally unintelligent people. They're not very good at communicating about feelings, especially not confrontation. You know the John Mulaney bit about how people keep their feelings in their belly and one day they'll die? That's my family. 

The older members, ie born before the 80s, are the most like this. Us younger ones are doing better but. Oof. Our older generation is not. You need that for context. More context you need is their relationship with Catholicism. We are Irish Catholics who came from Ireland, landed in Pittsburgh, and never left. Most of my family worked in the steel mills, when the air quality here was still something out of a Dickens novel. They went to churches where they were encouraged to fully and completely trusting of their priest, the Bible, and the Pope. If your priest tells you being gay is a sin, of course you believe it. These are churches that have graveyards ""for the unborn"". I remember being a child and being given a set of rosaries where the beads were little fetuses in wombs. Yeah. it was fucking weird. These are people who believe that heaven and hell are physical places. Babies who die before being baptised will go to hell. Transubstantiation is a real thing, not symbolic. 

That's most of the background. The most trouble we are having is with my great aunt, and one of her adult sons.Great aunt is, to be blunt, not the brightest. But she was not raised in a way that encouraged critical thinking skills, you can't blame her for that. Two years ago, she lost two of her sisters within 3 weeks of each other, very suddenly. It absolutely crushed her. And now because of Covid she is really suffering re social isolation. I don't know as much about her adult son, but they've both always been such fucking kind people. Clueless sometimes, but so kind. When I came out it was no big deal to them. They've shown compassion to my cousin who struggled with addiction. They're the kind of people you can call in the middle of the night when you're in trouble. 

But now they've gone fucking bananas. I feel like QAnon has taken these kind, vulnerable people, convinced them that there are children bring kidnapped by Democrats, and it just spiraled from there. When you believe that bread and wine PHYSICALLY TRANSFORMS into the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ, it's not that big of a logical leap to be convinced that Joe Biden tortures children for their hormonal energy or whatever the fuck. I can almost GUARANTEE that they don't understand the horrible racism, antisemitism, etc involved in QAnon. Don't get me wrong: they are participating in these things, and it's Wrong of them. They're adults who can make decisions, and they're choosing to be fucking awful. 

But if they were just shitty people, I could just write them off as shitty people. But it's not that simple. I've lost my loved ones to a cult that manipulated them. It makes me so angry, all the time. Sometimes I think about my Gran, and how horrified she would be by her sister's facebook posts, glorifying Trump as a savior and saying the election was fraudulent. 

I've very much taken a ""detach with love"" stance. If they ever want to leave that shit, I'll welcome them back. It's important for people in cults to know there is someone on the outside who loves them, otherwise they'll never leave. But it's been heavy on my mind lately, and I've been ranting to my boyfriend about it constantly. That's not fair to him, so here I am.

THEN, if found out not only is she a contributor, she's connected to QAnon members, compiling and redistributing all kinds of false information (including crazy ideas like the Democrats manipulated the weather system with satellites to punish Texas) and has been a major contributor of Fake QAnon news and theories to several fake news sites, including Before It's News, where her articles get tens to hundreds of thousands of views.

I know many QAnon parents have estranged their children because of their beliefs, have any of you decided to estrange yourself from your parents? It seems it's enveloped her life and she doesn't care if I exist. Just curious if there are others with similar experiences.",QAnonCasualties
525,Divorce after 12 years because of Q conspiracies and Trump,"So I find myself in the midst of a divorce due to Q type conspiracies. My spouse avoids the question of whether she is a Q supporter or not but she fully supports a whole host of the Q conspiracies. She‚Äôs a major Anti-vaxer, believes 5G is dangerous, believes in the great reset conspiracy, the Democrats pedophelia, the election being stolen, the coming civil unrest, and on and on! I‚Äôve been married for 12 years and have struggled with her rabbit hole of conspiracies for almost 10 of those years. Trump being elected just accelerated the situation. She was down at the capital during the insurrection, armed with pepper spray and a knife. She claims she was there for an anti-vaccine rally but upon further research, it was a supporting rally for the insurrection with multiple members of her rally, playing a part in the insurrection. She is completely brainwashed and I am at wits end dealing with it. She went from an ultra liberal to now an alt-right, trump supporting conspiracy theorist. I have two children 8 and 10 who are in the middle of all of this. I do my best to show them I love them and that they are my reason for living and that I would do anything for them but they are still blaming me for the divorce. My wife will not acknowledge any responsibility because she doesn‚Äôt feel she is wrong with her views. I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best way to help my children if anyone has an idea. I‚Äôm trying to slowly bring them out of the cult like mindset of their mother without the direct trauma of taking them away completely. I figured if they see half the time a level of rational and normalcy that it may allow them on there own to see the truth without me forcing the change on them. It‚Äôs either this way or I take them away completely from their mother. They are 8 and 10 and I don‚Äôt want that trauma to scar them. I‚Äôm at a loss as to what to do! I waited this long to finally get a divorce because I was trying to find the best option for my kids. The insurrection was finally it for me along with forcing my kids to not wear masks and telling me she will seize all contact with me if I get the Covid vaccine. It‚Äôs too much! As you can see from my rambling that I‚Äôm in need of guidance. I‚Äôm in a crazy situation.",QAnonCasualties

527,We don‚Äôt want them.,"Conservative here.  I‚Äôm tired of being classified as part of the ‚ÄúQpeople‚Äù because of my political affiliation.  

The Qult are not the majority, but because they are so ‚Äúloud,‚Äù we are all being placed into one group.

I don‚Äôt claim these people.  They fall into the same category as KKK and Antifa.  Undesirables and domestic terrorist threats.  (They are also officially labeled as such.)

Conservatives have to find a place to come together and distance ourselves from the Qult.  They are a disease and the infection is spreading.  This is an area maybe even the left and right could find common ground on and work together?

Christians using scripture to back up these lies are either deceived or are only professed Christians.  Pastors and priests also have to unite in denouncing the Q movement.  It is not Godly, nor does it mirror any of Christ‚Äôs teachings. 

‚ÄúQ‚Äù posts were first on the website called 4chan.  This site is also known for child pornography.  Qpeople are against child trafficking, yet they follow a man whose beginnings originated in a place conducive to child abuse.  

Lin Wood is playing them as fiddles.  This man actually claimed to be Christ as the second coming.  Legal briefs are filed with the Court that go into more disturbing details of things he‚Äôs said.  You can also find pages 9 and 10 of the Georgia Bar grievance to be equally disturbing.  He holds daily pity parties via Telegram and then regularly sends his ‚ÄúArmy‚Äù of ‚Äúdigital soldiers‚Äù after people, including his own son.  He also published physical addresses of the people seeking to disbar him.  It appears to be a way to distract the Qultists so that they don‚Äôt rise up against him for all of his past lies, particularly about Trump remaining in office.  If he is disbarred, I fear this will only fuel the Qultists, as he indoctrinates them daily about it being politically motivated and ultimately tied to child sex traffickers.  He is laying the foundation to be a martyr.  

Simon Parkes believes his mother is an alien and that he also fathered a hybrid alien child himself.  This man is occult.  

Christians should know better.  These are not Godly leaders.  It makes me wonder if this is part of the strong delusion that God says he will send, where even the elect will be deceived.

Where are other conservatives and Christians like me?  We must find each other and push back against these lies.",QAnonCasualties

If you have a family member in QAnon and would be willing to share your experiences with the students, I'm toying with the idea of inviting someone to zoom into the course to help personalize the impact on family. If sharing your experiences would be cathartic for you and help others understand what your situation is like, please reach out via DMs. I'm envisioning a 10-20 minute opportunity to chat with the 15 students to describe your situation and to answer questions they might have.

530,Our Method of Dealing,"This won't work for the more rabid Qooks out there, but my father is extremely, angrily conservative, and I'm becoming more liberal every year. We also like to travel together, and as we're both single older men, it's truly a pleasure to have the company. Several years ago, as the nation's passions were rising, we took a trip to Romania. Our promise, agreed to explicitly on both sides, was that we would not even mention politics, or anything - *anything* \- about politics. That worked, and we've since travelled alone together, and in groups, without any bad feelings or misunderstanding. That just reinforced my belief that many Q adherents are simply so disconnected from the objects of their contempt that they no longer realize they're just human beings, like all of us. My dad is a kind, caring person, in the most local, immediate, in-person sense. He wouldn't harm a single person - as long as he recognizes them as a person.

531,The QAnon year,"Just joined after reading about this subreddit on NYT.  I'm M/late 40s; my GF is in mid 40s.  We met a little over a year ago &amp; hit off a great relationship.  Little did I realize what I was headed into.

She:  Lets watch Fox TV.

Me:  Sure.

She:  Covid is a conspiracy.  Virus was built in a lab.  China is bad.  Masks are killing people.  Soros is evil.  So are Clinton, Biden.  Gates is trying to convert people to bots.  Vaccine will alter DNA.  BLM, Antifa, Radical Left are destroying this country.  Democrats &amp; celebs are pedos.  CNN, NYT, ABC, CBS.....are bs.  You like NFL?  I love Dana P. and Greg G.  Lame Stream Media is all bs.

Me:  Hmmm.  Lamestream?  That was Palin, no?

She:  Facebook is bad.

Me:  Yes!!  {There is hope}

She:  Trump is so Christian.  Look he has Bible in his hand - 'this sends shivers down my spine'.  Isn't this amazing - he's going to save us and humanity.

Me:  Who?  Donald?!

She:  Lets buy food, guns, ammo, candles, batteries, water, gold coins.  Lets bury the food in 2' deep soil outside.

Me:  Who's digging?

She:   I love my country.  I'm a patriot.  All traitors will be executed (sic).

Me:  Are we still in 21st century USA?  Who uses 'Traitor' and 'Executed' in serious conversation?

\----elections, inauguration etc-----

She:  Elections are stolen.  Fox is also bad.  Dana P has turned.  Mitch M. is also a traitor.  All traitors are revealing themselves.  Lets watch Newsmax &amp; OAN.

Me:  Is it legal to charge $5 for utter crap?

She:  Rudy, Sidney, Li are gods!  They'll find a way.

Me:  Did he just fart?

She:  There will be blackouts.  There won't be any inauguration.  Trump gets second term.  Army is going to arrest everyone.

Me:  I'm working remote.

She:  {crying - tears streaming down her face}   There's no God!  (sic)  Why else would Biden be President?!

Me:  {consoling}  It'll be alright.  {secretly hoping this is the end of this phase}

\---Ten days later---

She:  Did you know that USA is a corporation?

Me:  What?!

She:  Yep.  Trump will be inaugurated in March.  USA and Taiwan are sending forces to get rid of Communist Party of China.  Xi is really a friend.  Trump put Flynn and his brother in charge before he left.  They will save us.

Me:  You effin Whacko!  Get the eff out!!  I have work to do!

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so it didn't end just like that.  But its been an incredible amount of tears, drama and foolishness.  Just really tired - and in shock -  that the last year of my life ended like this.  I really love her - and I have tried to salvage the situation an innumerable number of times.  But really, I couldn't even get a word in when she would lay out her arguments.

Her last email says "".....(family)  heritage whom set the tone not follow like a sheep.""  And yes, the implied reference to sheep is Me.  She still thinks that she has discovered the truth.

Here's the kicker - Even though she's been in USA for over twenty years, she's French &amp; not even an American citizen.

535,I just didn't know how common this was,"It started with the constant drone of Fox News in my (34M) parents house anytime my wife and I were over. As time went on, my father slipped more and more into his iPad. It became nothing but a Facebook machine, the holding place for the echo chamber. Content systematically delivered to find into the fringe things he started digging into.

He's from a generation where the news was more trusted. Where not everything was a blatant opinion piece, doling out strictly partisan politics and us versus them ideologies.

As the 2016 election went on, he already was a pro Trump guy because... Well, his reasons were copy pasted from news sources. Crooked Hillary. Benghazi. She's a career politician and he's a billionaire business man.

Then he started pandering Sandy Hook conspiracies and I thought this guy is really going over the edge.

I remember the day he casually said, ""One of the pages I follow on Facebook, this Q Anon person said....""

And I'm in my 30s, grew up on the internet and yeah even 4chan. I knew what it was. God, wasn't it obvious trolling and incitement? Wasn't it so clearly just bullshit?

I don't support either party. Nothing but crooks, too much money in politics. Class division is the true unfought fight in our world.

I tried to temper him, reading him Trump quotes out of context and watching his brain short circuit when I said, ""That was Trump who said windmills cause cancer."" He would huff off, knowing the jig was up but too much at battle with cognitive dissonance.

It got to the point where all he did was respond with Q talking points and corporate for-profit news bullshit. I could predict what he would say, because it was all that predictable and just utterly programmed.

I tried to tell him this and he told me I was brainwashed. Just like when I said I wasn't for Trump, he put it on me that I must have been for Hillary. He couldn't compute that I don't support any of this type of garbage. I watched him fall apart from a good man with a sharp mind into just another parroting qultist.

He started treating my wife poorly, despite her having no such interactions. She was guilty by association. In July 2019, my wife asked him to walk her down the aisle at our wedding, because her parents are not with us. We mutually cried and he accepted.

In August, he lost it. Told me I was brainwashed. Started treating her like shit. I told him we were done and that he would have to come before me like Christ himself to apologize to my wife for ruining our family and our wedding.

Nothing. We were pregnant at that time, and he didn't know. I shared the news months later. Nothing.

Our daughter turns 1 year old this weekend. I have not seen or heard from him since August of 2019. My parents, both alive and well, were not there for the birth of my daughter. They won't be there for her first birthday. They're nearing 70 and both smokers, so I don't know if I will ever see them again.

Maybe like others, I was foolishly hopeful that the election cycle would shake a lot of this off. But the truth is, we've been calling them cultists and the election cycle doesn't effect that. I have no doubt he would have traveled to DC on Jan 6 if he was physically able. I have no doubt he thinks Trump will just reappear in the Oval Office in March like these people are saying now.

I often say that the people in our lives will show us who we want to be.... And others will show us who we must not become. My only solace is the standards I have as a father and husband are informed by this.

Just another story, same as so many. Thanks for providing a place I could write it down.

536,I may have made some progress,"My boyfriend is deep into the QAnon koolaid. He started down the path via David Icke combined with his incredibly conservative upbringing. 

We have fought over politics (and reality itself) for nearly a year. He talked about how ‚Äòthe left‚Äô and ‚Äòliberals‚Äô are ruled by their emotions. But I walk on eggshells never knowing what topic I might want to talk about that he somehow connects to all the conspiracies and would get triggered and start ranting. When he starts that, hearing himself say the things he believes gives him a hit of dopamine. He spins himself up on the drug, getting louder and more angry the longer he speaks. He can‚Äôt hear anything around him. When I try to get a word in, he doesn‚Äôt let me finish a sentence. He makes an assumption about where my sentence is going and that it disagrees with him, and to prevent the cognitive dissonance and discomfort of hearing something that conflicts with his views, he interrupts and starts on a rant again.

The progress I made last night had absolutely nothing to do with addressing the conspiracies. I talked to him about how we communicate, and his habits around talking with me. I told him how he behaves and what he does. 

And he doesn‚Äôt do it to just me, he does it to his best friend too. I talked to him about how he projects what he thinks I think onto me, without actually listening to what I have to say. I talked about how he spins himself up and seems high and crazed from this essentially drug. I talked about how I walk on eggshells because he gets triggered by topics I thought weren‚Äôt political at all. I talked about how there is no space in the relationship for me- only his ideas, his beliefs and his ego. None of this had anything to do with QAnon or the beliefs themselves. 

He admitted that he does project onto me and assume what I believe for me. He admitted to being too much of a zealot.

540,"I recently stood up against a conspiracy theorist in front of his daughters. While I did so with a clear conscience and positive intent, I can‚Äôt help but feel guilty and feeling perhaps I could have handled it differently. Some of my friends think I should just let him be.","My friends and I have a gaming group chat on WhatsApp. There are 15 of us in the group, some of whom I‚Äôm very close to, while others are close friends of friends whom I‚Äôve gotten to become friendly with. The group also includes two teenage daughters of a friend. For illustration purposes here, I‚Äôm going to call him Jake. All 15 of us are natives of Southeast Asia and live here. 

Recently, I‚Äôve realised that Jake has become more vocal with conspiracy theories. I‚Äôve met him for drinks a couple of times with the intention of catching up. These catch up sessions however, I‚Äôve realised, tend to pivot progressively to something a bit more ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù, where almost always, at some point, I get ‚Äúpreached‚Äù to about about some sort of conspiracy theory. I tend to ignore them unless they are COVID related. Even then, I ignored them at first as just a quirk of Jake‚Äôs. Then, I started getting private texts. It was at first from Jake, then another friend, and another. All of which supported some sort of ridiculous theory about COVID. 

I‚Äôd like to think that I‚Äôm quite educated, am well-read, and because I am a bit of a stickler for facts, tend to cross-check the information I receive across multiple credible sources or news sites. However, as conversations with Jake progressed, he started making me feel as though I was arrogant or not as well read as I thought I was. He also started sharing conspiracy theories about COVID being a scam on our gaming group chat more frequently. 

That was when I drew the line and started replying to provide different perspectives that contradicts his COVID-related conspiracy theories on the group chat. 

I did so because I understand how dangerous conspiracy theories can be, and how easily one can get rabbit-holed. It has serious real world consequences, especially in uncertain times like these. So, personally, I‚Äôve made a socially conscious decision to speak up whenever someone spreads conspiracy theories, especially when it relates to COVID, instead of enabling them further or allowing that behaviour to be normalised. 

Some of my friends who like me, don‚Äôt buy in to these conspiracy theories think that I should ‚Äúlet Jake be Jake‚Äù. That I should be more tolerant. 

I disagreed. 

I did what I did because it was driven by three intentions:

1. I was not looking to change Jake‚Äôs views. I‚Äôve had numerous interactions with him and have tried different types of approaches to change his beliefs. Unfortunately, I honestly think that he has gone too far down the rabbit hole. I‚Äôve accepted that it is highly unlikely that I would be able to convince him to change his belief. The only reason I responded to him was because he was sharing disinformation about COVID being a scam. I posted what I did because there are two teenagers in that group chat. His daughters. 

2. My ‚Äútarget‚Äù, although it may seem like so, isn‚Äôt Jake. It was his audience. In this case, his two daughters, his best friend and the rest of the members in the group. I felt that his daughters and best friend may find themselves to be more invested in changing his perspective than I do. For me, selfishly, I am more invested in preventing others being drawn in to conspiracy theories than I am in the person spreading it. I had shared an article from Healthline on the psychology of conspiracy theorists in response to a couple of videos Jake had posted which perpetuated a view by one Dr. Simone Gold which drove disinformation about COVID. He had manipulated the fact that she was doctor to justify it as truth. This act of mine however, I feel, did kill the group chat‚Äôs vibe. Jake has also gone silent on the group chat. 

3. However, if my action discourages or silences one person from sharing a blatant lie or false theories that has no scientific basis whatsoever, then maybe, that‚Äôs one less act of disinformation that is contributing to potential real world, life and death consequences. It‚Äôs a bonus outcome I would welcome with a clear conscience. I can‚Äôt help but hope that there are many more out there who share my intentions and do the same when it comes to conspiracy theorists. The same way most people would speak up against racism, sexism or violence. Because to me, disinformation about COVID, is far more dangerous than those three combined, especially in the middle of a pandemic that has killed millions.",QAnonCasualties

Anyone absorb any podcasts, articles, twitter threads, videos that made you feel a little more knowledgeable on the subject? or maybe less alone? This subreddit has been helpful in and of itself.

I'm you know, the daughter of two people I love so much and have always been extremely close with. I had pretty much called my Mom every single day since I left home for years, up until last year. I don't even want to talk to her anymore. The anti-vax emails, the foaming-at-the-mouth love for Donald Trump, the extremely shady ""memes"" she was sharing on Facebook and Instagram became all so incredibly hard to watch. So many of her own close friends cut her off cold turkey without explanation, won't return her calls, blocked her online, and she ""doesn't know why"". I know why. 

I am an extremely non-confrontational person. I've never broached the subject head on with either of my parents. When they start going down the Q-hole with me in conversation, I tend to find an excuse to get off the phone. I blocked them both on Facebook for my own sanity a few months ago and vaguely told them ""Oh I deleted it"". I can't tell if my ""pretend-i-do-not-see"" approach is good or just evasive and hurting them further. But, they are very smart people who have just filled their brains with garbage who I think, even if I took them head on, would think I ""don't see the truth"" and am not as ""well researched"" as they are.

543,QAnon watchers,"&amp;#x200B;

That is how I would describe my husband of 35 years.  He does not follow all of the QAnon conspiracies.  He does not believe the pedophiles who eat children.  But he does agree with most of their deep state crap.  He believes the election was stolen.  He does not condemn the Capital riots, he believes the virus is overblown, he believes Trump is all but the second coming.  He  had such a fit yesterday about gas prices that his yelling scared both of our dogs into trembling.  He would rather have me avoid him at all costs, for me to spend evenings in tears over his anger at all of the ‚Äùlying left‚Äù than to admit his alternative facts do not stand up to reality.

 The part that makes me the most angry is that he does not come out as QAnon, but leans so far right these days that there is very little daylight.  We have always seen politics different.  I am a lifelong Democrat.  He was liberal when we married.  I started losing him to the far right 20 years ago.  That‚Äôs when he started listening to Rush Limbaugh on his truck radio all the time.  Now trying to talk to him is like talking to Rush or Hannity or any other Fox idiots.  To me, Q is an evil poltergeist, made up of all of theses ranting, angry morons.  They spew hate and rage and stoke fear.  Words have power! They are ruining families everyday with the hate and bigotry they vomit out.    


I wonder if I can sue Fox if all of this costs me my marriage.  Probably not.  Fox and QAnon walk hand in hand.  They will lead your loved ones down a dark path you may not be able to follow.  I don‚Äôt know how to stop the damage or reverse the process.",QAnonCasualties
544,My Uncle (Just me venting),"Hi everyone! My name's Jill, I just found out about this subreddit today from an article on Politico and wanted to post/vent about my uncle, who is falling progressively deeper into the whole QAnon hole.

As background, my uncle used to be a pretty moderate guy politically. He may not have been a genius, but I never thought he was dumb, gullible, or anything like that. Things really started to change though during the Great Recession. Like a lot of people he lost his job. Around the same time, his marriage fell apart and, ultimately, he had to declare bankruptcy. He started blaming then President Obama for his problems and the fact he was not getting back on his feet as fast as he felt that he should. After talking with my mom and other members of our family, he moved to Florida, where most of them lived, both to have more of a social support system and in hopes of having more opportunity for a job than in the shrinking midwestern city he had lived in. Although he kept drifting rightward politically, there still wasn't much of a sign that he was falling in with QAnon until the last few months.

Predictably given the scenario above, he was a HUGE Trump supporter. Everything he and his prominent supporters said was the gospel truth regardless of facts to the contrary. When more mainstream news sites started not giving him the take on things he wanted, my uncle started drifting to more extreme sites peddling conspiracy theories, edited videos, and the like. Suddenly, everyone to the left of Trump was a dangerous Marxist and a member of Antifa (including my wife, my mom, and I, all of whom did not buy into Trumpism or these conspiracies) out to destroy his country.

So, its important to point out three things here about myself and my life. 1) Although I identify as a trans woman now, I did not at the point in time at that this next part takes place and am still not out to my family yet, 2) my wife identifies as a member of a religious minority in America and my uncle knows this, and 3) I have a doctorate in an area of public policy. Things started taking a hard turn and our relationship strained when he decided to post some things on social media defending white supremacist groups who had actively called for harm against Jewish people, Muslims, and people of color in our country, often implicitly but often explicitly. I pointed out to him just how much this hurt considering his nephew, who he supposedly cared about and was definitely a part of his family, was married to someone who was being targeted by these groups. I told him I was appalled that he could possibly defend and agree with people who, given the chance, would kill my wife and any children we hoped to have. His only response was that he was looking out for his family and that I needed to do more research like he did if I actually thought the mainstream media was telling me the truth about these groups (proceeding to link me to an opinion post on Scott Adam's blog).

That was kind of the start of his slide. From there, his social media became full of reposts and retweets of articles supporting QAnon causes or from actively Q affiliated accounts. He started asking for Q's take on other articles he found, seemingly in all seriousness. Although I can't necessarily prove it since my uncle is really the only member of my extended family who is active on social media, but I think he pulled in more of them with him. Not that we would have gone given the pandemic, but my mom, wife, and I were noticeably the only members of my family not invited to Thanksgiving. He also went no contact with my mom for a long time, believing her to be a traitor for voting for Biden. I've similarly gone no contact with him after he posted a slew of QAnon related articles following the attempted coup in January, trying to belittle what happened, blame it on left wing agitators or the deep state, and the like.

All that said, its just sad that all of this has happened, I see no way to pull him out of it, or signs that he will come back to reality. I'm glad that my wife has a strong connection with her family and that my mom and dad do not subscribe to this cult, but I wish my future kids would be able to connect with some family on my side of things. I'm an only child and, barring things changing unexpectedly, I don't think I'd feel comfortable letting any of my extended family near any of my future children. Especially once I'm out, I know I'd likely be excommunicated from that part of the family anyway since transphobia runs deep there as well, but still, it'd be nice to at least have someone I'm related to who isn't a part of this cult.",QAnonCasualties
545,Need to talk to my parents and I have no idea how to do it.,"I need to call my parents tonight. I haven't had a conversation with them since before 1/6 and I've put off talking to them about as long as I could. But I've been too afraid to talk to them; afraid of what they might say or might believe.

I don't know how far down the hole they've gone. Dad's mentioned bread crumbs before. They were feverish supporters of 45. They believed the election was stolen. But they know my politics and never seemed to let that get in the way. I'm pretty sure they know I don't eat babies or whatever. But they're getting older, and I'm getting older - and all the things that come with that fact. And I can't keep avoiding them.

Just the knowledge that basically 30% of Americans believed the storming of the capital was justified, has me petrified at what my parents might believe. But I have no idea what to say. ""Do you believe this Q stuff? Do you believe the sedition was justified?"" ""Antifa inciters  &gt; BLM &gt; Hillary (queue Michael Bay explosions).""

Or do I just ignore it, bury my fears when I'm around them and carry on as normal? I feel like carrying on as normal is what got us here in the first place :\\",QAnonCasualties
546,Check in on Q Dad,"Hi 

I posted on here around the inauguration and I am just back to say that since then I have had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and I am ok. No bad side effects except tiredness and sore body. 

My Dad has emailed me various Q-based things insisting that the Vaccine will make me sterile, that I don't need it because I am young and healthy, etc.  He continues the same exact rhetoric, using the same language. There is nothing individual or even remotely reminiscent of his Old Self. My sister is currently living with him (she's young twenties) and that seems to be helping him calm the Q stuff down but she will be moving out at the end of the month. I wonder how things will go for him as the year continues. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would not say I am worried for him but I am sad. I wish my Mom wasn't dead. I wish he'd stop seeing his awful ex-wife. I wish he'd just Live and be present. Back during the Holidays when we thought we might be able to swing a family get-together he was politely disinvited due to his Trump-supporting. It's my Mom's family, so he claims to not care but they've been his family too for over twenty years. He got really angry and lashed out about it so I don't think he is welcome anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I just feel fatigued. I don't think I will ever be able to de-program him or make him see how bullshit it all is. I'll just have to wait and see how it shakes out. Supposedly, Trump is re-taking the presidency in March according to the Qs so when that doesn't happen I wonder what the next excuse will be. I'm hoping at some point I can reconnect with him without this Huge divide. Wishing you all the same.",QAnonCasualties
547,glad to be here,"I've just joined this group. I am really glad to be here and read some of your posts. This past year has been really searing as I have realized how deeply my family has rejected me. The major evidence of their slide into Qanon was one email my mother sent me last summer to try to initiate a conversation with me. She included the email history, so I could see that it had circulated among my father, an uncle and some church members. I responded to her that I don't think it's worth our time to talk about anonymous posts made on dodgy websites. That is a fairly typical response for me, because I teach at the college level and tend to be direct with people who are off the wall in their thinking. I did some searching and found out that the website is actually a popular Qanon site, but only after I had sent my response to my mother. She never responded, so she basically went underground with her thoughts.

There is much more that I can share, much more than just a single email. But I wanted to jump in a talk about some of it. Thanks to you all.",QAnonCasualties
548,Unhinged brother,"So this is tangentially related.  My brother is a commander in the Navy, and is a full on Trumper.  I don‚Äôt have verification if he‚Äôs gone down the Q path, but it wouldn‚Äôt shock me on the least.  If there is another group that is a more general group for crazy conservative family members, I will gladly post there!

My mom and me are the outspoken liberals in our family, and all around black sheep.  Always have been.  My family dynamics were FUBAR long before Trump and Q.  But the rage and anger my middle aged brother seems to feel these days is terrifying.  And he purposely picks fights with our liberal, 78 year old mom.  Even to go as far as physically threatening her once, when she dared to criticize his ‚Äòboss and commander in chief‚Äô.  Let‚Äôs just say we keep great distance between us and him.  It‚Äôs healthier.  Out of the blue, he calls my mom this morning and baits her with politics, this time about Texas.  She wasn‚Äôt overly sympathetic and this triggered him into screaming at her about how hateful she was and she wants to kill people and she‚Äôs an awful human.  He then hung up on her.  It‚Äôs like he called to just bait her into a known opinion so that he could unleash all his anger against liberals and women.  She was crying and super upset and I am just SO ANGRY.    Fuck these people.  They are terrifying.

551,Sharing child custody with QAnon adherents,"I am a parent who shares a child with QAnon believers. This has been going on for several years. 

My partner and I have always been very careful not to disparage the beliefs of our child's other parents; instead we say, ""Well, that is one way of looking at it. Here are some factors that we consider when choosing what to believe, but you get to choose what to believe in."" We also talk about credible sources and we've done the Checkology news literacy course together (check it out! it's really good). 

Our child is in therapy because of all this. She really struggled with the fact that both sets of parents did not believe the same things; her therapist said that it was hard for a child's identity formation to have to change their belief system each week when they transitioned to the other house. 

In the past several months, though, she has turned a corner and is skeptical of what her QAnon parents believe in because she has been able to identify their hypocrisy, their inability to listen to her and her feelings, and how bizarre their beliefs are in comparison to literally everyone else in her life. 

She doesn't like being at their house. She'd rather live with us. But she doesn't want to say this to them because she crumples whenever they are upset with her. She can't withstand their anger enough to be able to say what she wants. We haven't initiated any custody proceedings because it would cause so much emotional distress for her to be in conflict with the other set of parents, and we think they'd pressure her into saying that she wants to live with them. 

However, we're waiting until she gets old enough to be able to tolerate the discomfort of being in conflict with them. Still, the custody laws in our state are such that unless they are physically abusing her, it's hard to get full custody.

Is anyone else going through this? I just don't know anyone who's dealt with this. We feel very alone when it comes to this issue. When we talk about it to other people, they are in shock and disbelief about our story, which isn't really helpful. Or they say we should just get custody, and they don't understand that it is not likely we'd ever get full custody and they don't understand the harm it would do to our child to go through a pointless custody battle. 

In the meantime, we just focus on modeling healthy relationships, emotional boundaries, and accountability for our child. We talk with her about her feelings, help her process what's going on, and encourage her to call us if anything scary ever happens. But it's really hard to see her have to go through this.",QAnonCasualties
552,Too many people in my life have fallen into this cult,"Hi friends, I'm not new to Reddit, but this is a burner account. Since the summer, so many people in my life have fallen into this hole, and I don't know why. It might be due to the Coronavirus, I don't know, but it's had such a mental toll on me and the rest of my family. For example, my aunt unfortunately was seduced by this cult, and has attacked anyone in my family who's a Democrat, Independent, or an anti-Trump Republican, like my grandparents and my parents. Honestly, I just don't know what to do at this point, and she may have gone to the Capitol during the siege because I know a local company was renting buses and taking people down there to riot.",QAnonCasualties

554,First time posting but the curiousity is killing me!,"Hi,
So my family has just been ridiculous obviously that's why I'm here. They have spent a year fighting me about following guidelines instead of using any of that time to spend with their first grand kid. She's 16 months, I have a cancer history obviously better safe than sorry. They have lied and tried to endangered us multiple times because they wanted to go eat in a restaurant; or see a large group of friends instead of whatever we had planned.  Whatever. I really don't care what they do, just don't put us in harm's way. Ya know?

558,"Guess it's my turn now, lost my own mother.","So my mother has always been a believer in a lot of quirky stuff. Growing up she was all into Nostradamus etc... In 2000, she bought pallets of water etc...

Now 20  years later, she is ""engaged"" to a ex army vet as she divorced my dad 14 years ago. I don't blame her for that, my dad has a lot of issues of his own. However, he is VERY anti liberal, yet face to face he is a very nice guy. However, he has no balls as he lets his own kids run all over him etc...

Anyway, I don't want to make this longer that it needs to be. Early 2020, my mom didn't even like Trump. However, by the time the election came up she went full hardcore Trump. We had some discussions throughout 2020 and I watched the conversion. I tried to fight some of it, but it went nowhere. She never really called me unless she needed something, usually technical, though the latest ones were more about how she could hide her money so she can stay on Medicaid üôÑ. The hypocrisy knows no bounds.

She is 60 years old and she is on Medicaid, yet I don't think she should even be eligible. She had a ""cough"" and they gave her disability? Yet she rants all the time about ""blacks"" who are too lazy to hold a job and take advantage of the government. How does she not see the hypocrisy? It is 100% what she is!

Anyways, every single call with her ended up being converted to political. She said I never called her, which is bullshit, she just never answered. Yesterday was the final straw. She went into how the election was stolen again and I just hung up on her. I texted her afterwards with this.... and I probably went overboard, but I give up. I dread even talking to her now. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I'm done, don't call me anymore. I said before to stop this bullshit. Go join with your QANON cult and eat up their bullshit. The reason gas is going up is because of OPEC cuts  + increased demand as the pandemic is having less and less impact on decreased driving and also refinery shutdowns in TX. Not a pipeline that was never even built. But keep blaming what the boogeyman fox tells you to. You are so gullible you'll believe anything fox tells you. The fact you STILL think the election was stolen when everyone else admits it wasn't except trump and a few fox talking bobble heads is so stupid. TRUMP LOST DEAL WITH IT!   
&gt;  
&gt; You bitch how people are ""taking"" money, yet your trying to hide your money so you can live off the government on Medicare. You've only been a waitress all your life, hiding your tips so you don't pay much in taxes, then bitch how little you get? NO SHIT! How do you have anymore right to that than someone else? You have less of a right to that money as you paid in tons less. You bitch how people should be working, SO SHOULD YOU!

559,"I'm hurt, confused, but I think mostly angry...","I need to share with someone that's objective, I found this reddit forum and I thought it would be good.  I just need to vent a little.  My mother has been deep into conspiracy theories for as long as I remember.  I think the only one she didn't buy at face value was Bush doing 9/11 and I only think that's only because she voted for him.  But she used to talk about how evil public school teachers were and that they only wanted to make kids atheists.  All kinds of crazy crap.  I grew up knowing what Christian Nationalism was, I used to know the pledge to the Christian flag.  I tell my wife this stuff and she looks at me like I've got three heads.  

When I was younger my brother and I were pitted against each other for my mother's affection.  She used to treat my brother so horribly, she beat him with a belt one time so badly that he fell and hit his head in a tub, we used to tell that story for laughs, its not funny anymore, and now I realize it never was.

Sorry, to the Q stuff, recently my parents have taken a deep dive into Qanon.  Now that I no longer believe like they do I'm the enemy now.  My brother and I are a united front for the first time in our lives and that seems to be making their ire worse.  I've tried to talk to them but it always ends up the same way yelling and crying.  My mother will start by yelling and then go straight into crying once that doesn't work (this is an old tactic and one I'm used to, it no longer phases me).

My dad's a little more receptive but every stride gets pulled back because of my mother.  My dad has always been a keep the peace kinda guy.  He'll go along with whatever my mother says.  I don't mean that to degrade him but it's true.  My father and I used to be really close.  I'd talk to him almost daily.  Now I avoid talking to him at all.  I was gonna name my first son after him, but I can't bring myself to do that anymore.

The last time I attempted to talk to them about this stuff my mother disowned me and said she never wanted to talk to me again.  She texted me this, there was clear record.  She tried to call me a week later like nothing had happened.  I told her ""I thought you never wanted to speak to me again."" She started screaming saying she never said that and that I was lying.  I read her texts back to her and she just said she didn't remember doing that.  I told her I had no interest in talking with her until she apologized.  She responded with ""fine, I'm sorry."". I told her she had to mean it.  Not just say it.  She responded with ""I didn't do anything wrong.""

I think my mother being gone into this Q stuff doesn't bother me as much as my Dad.  I miss my dad and just want him back, but my wife and I are going to start having a family soon and I can't have this insanity around my kids.

Get your facts together. Debunk as many Qanon conspiracies/lie as you can. Print it out. Put together a nice package that a 3rd grader can understand. Use multiple sources. This is a bit time consuming but very important. 

Then you need to take those Qanon believes head on. In my case they were all male. I told them they were believing in nonsense, and that they were anti American and to get the fuck out of my country with that fake news bullshit.

This will piss them off. Here comes the controversial part..........challenge them to a fight. Yes. Fist fight them. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you win or lose, but get some nice punches in. Once the fight is over and cooler heads prevail, they will see their actions are detrimental to your relationship. And cooler heads will prevails. Then start going over the fact booklet you made.

The     solutions, ideas in this article belong to me the savior messiah     buddha, you need my special permission to use it in the public/media.

There is no entity above religions.  
Religion is the best weapon to defeat the ‚Äúevil‚Äù, the ‚Äústupid‚Äù beings/entities.

The next revolution of this civilization will kick off with religion.  
People     in certain nation will not just only allow to choose the religion   they   want to follow, but in near future they will be allowed to choose   the   city/town/state/nation with purify only 100% followers of each   religion   to live it.

I can see some big land immigration nation such as United States, Canada, Australia will allow that happen.

There are many various religions out there, but there are 6 major influenced religion must be in the list is:  
\- Christianity  
\- Islam  
\- Judaism  
\- Hinduism  
\- Buddhism  
\- Nonreligious/Atheist

Imagine     if one new political promise allow people to live in 100% pure     followers of each religion, it would bring automatic win in any nation     for sure !

So instead of 1 choice, now you will have 2 choices.  
Instead     of ‚Äúgambling‚Äù in 1 religion in 1 society, now you can have your own     real life experiment in 100% purify religion society.

This     weapon is so big that if the West especially the USA using it  against    the East, they would win automatically. No any demi-gods,  angels or  any   entities in the game can counter it.

I do believe this is the only working solution for the USA and the West come out of the darkness.

568,Would you cut it off now,"My boyfriend is a long time conspiracy theorist. He‚Äôs smart, but seems to be missing some critical thinking skills when QAnon comes to play. 

He is this wonderful, sweet, kind and patient person. But, the idea of dealing with a lifetime of his crazy conspiracy theories gives me intense anxiety. We mostly avoid politics. His regurgitation of whatever he‚Äôs watching is frightening. And I wonder how good of a person can you actually be to eat this up?

569,From THE best mom ever to her destroying our family because of Qanon in just 2 years.,"My mom has failed us because of all this stuff, our family is completely destroyed. My dad left, cut ties and moved abroad. I'm 23 my sister is 20, left the house and fending for ourselves. She used to be an amazing mom, I remember those times. I used to tell her everything she was like my best friend. I miss her. 

She goes on and on about these absolutely insane theories every time I'm on the phone with her like people being executed, Trump actually still being the president of the US and Biden is going to go to Guantanamo ( we're not even American, we're fucking French, to be fair she says the same about Macron, that he's a clone and the real one got jailed or whatever...). I'm on the verge of cutting ties but I'm scared this would make her go deeper into this insanity. Every time I speak to her I feel like my mind is about to split in half from the BS. 

We get ZERO support or help from our mother because all she cares about or talks about now is this conspiracy stuff. What she put us through is unbelievable. Honestly I resent her, I'm only 23 I've had to take on full adult responsibilities out of the blue with no help, no guidance, nothing, in the middle of COVID.

He claims he is not Q (actually says he doesn't know what it is) but he is now on telegram and watching Newsmax, One World, Fox News all the time.  It's to the point that we can't have much conversation without him bringing it up, then we argue.  It's also hard because he is a doctor and I have always had a tremendous amount of respect for him.  I can't believe he actually believes these lies.  Furthermore, his elderly parents and my BIL all believe as well, so I am in the minority.

581,The Truth,"Hello, my name is Sage. I'm a 19 year old from England. I consider myself spiritual, skeptic and liberal.

My mum and her friend aren't necessarily Qanon supporters. They follow a variety of interpritation of our reality based on their personal 'research' but I question the reliability and bias in that research. Their beliefs would categorise themselves to others as conspiracy theorists but they like to consider themselves awake. 

One said she researched the pineal gland and that we have powers. 

My mum believes that the covid vaccine will rewrite everyones dna so they are no longer human. 

They also believe covid is a man made virus created by the government as a way of enforcing ""the new world order""

I am someone who doesnt like to talk on things unless I have researched them myself so I cant say they are right or wrong but the little I know about reality leads me to believe that it's most likely false information. Eg: I'm pretty sure it's not possible to rewrite a persons dna.

But the reason why I entertain these discussions is because it sounds like their is some truth to what they are saying and although unlikely some of what they say is possible. 

Eg: they believe the government is brainwashing people

Mk Ultra was a real program that existed. This is a fact. So what's to say that the government isn't brainwashing people today? 

Another example. Covid is man made 

Unit 731 was a real unit that existed during ww2 to test biological warfare. What's to say that experiments with similar goals havent been conducted since. 

I want to know the TRUTH. Has anyone took it upon themselves to research what they are saying? I have started but theres a lot to unpack and I dont just mean watch videos. I mean look up documents. Look up scientific studies. Cross refrencing research and recognising biases because I think their might be some truth to this but I want to seperate the bullshit from reality. 

Lastly, i am worried for my family. In a way the ""awake"" community seems like a cult where free thinking is falsely encouraged and anyone who doesnt believe the same thing has been programmed. 

I have had many arguments with my mum because I am some who asks too many questions in her eyes. We are not talking anymore. She thinks I'm too far gone because I had a covid test and she thinks I now have nano bots in her brain.

Has anyone been in the same position as me? What did you do? What did you find? Can you share research? And is this a cult? Can it still be a cult if some of what they say is true?",QAnonCasualties

583,Deprogram your loved one using Facebook and YouTube,"I want to thank user IllustriousStatus897 for his experience and the inspiration for this post. I replied to his post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lmk7kj/my_dad_quietly_deprogrammed_my_mom/) describing how his father assisted his mother in escaping the Q cult but I want to go into a little more detail here as I hope it might help some people to de-radicalize their relatives.

I think we all know that the primary nodes for radicalization on the Internet today are YouTube and Facebook. This is especially true of older relatives who have found their way into communities where extremist ideas and conspiracy theories are prevalent.

Both Facebook and YouTube use algorithmic systems to keep your attention on the site. These algorithms are intended to monitor what you enjoy, what gets and keeps your attention, and then deliver more of it. This is how fanatics and other bad actors utilize the internet to draw more people into their movements.

Once you click on a video you'll see more of that content, and this laser focused delivery system only becomes more effective the more you watch.

What I will suggest here are ways in which you can disrupt this process and potentially wean your loved one out of the delusion.

**YouTube**

YouTube is almost perfectly designed for radicalization. It has one goal - to keep you watching videos so that it can keep delivering ads and making money. By its very nature it's an ideal tool for cults and extremists because it does the brainwashing for them. All they need to do is supply the media, YouTube then does everything it can to lure people into the cult, because that's its business model.

So, how do you disrupt this?

Find something your relative loves. It can be anything. If you don't know of anything then make the focus cat or puppy videos. All you need is a healthy alternative they could be watching instead, something you're sure will catch their attention.

Let's just say you picked cat videos (everyone loves cats, right? If you don't, you're just wrong, sorry).

If you live with this relative and have access to the device they use then access it yourself when you can whenever they're not around. Don't be creepy about it, don't invade their privacy, but if there's a shared PC they usually watch Q videos on use it when they're not around to access cat videos. Watch as many as possible. Click like on them, maybe even leave a comment.

Gradually you'll replace the conspiracy theory videos with cat videos. Sure, they could just search for something themselves, but how many of them searched for Qanon in the first place? Most probably just clicked a link from Facebook and that started them on the algorithmic automation of radicalization.

After you've spent a few hours watching cat videos on that shared PC when they come back to YouTube they won't see ten new Qanon videos telling them the latest nonsense to believe, they'll see ten cute cat videos you haven't watched yet.

There's a very good chance that even if they're still seeing the occasional Q video they'll start to realize they're happier seeing cat videos.

Right now they're getting their endorphin hit from the outrage and fear of Q. The endorphin hit from laughing, or even just smiling, while watching a cat knock things off a table will be a more pleasant experience.

Let the cats radicalize them away from the fanatics.

In time you'll break the algorithmic hold YouTube has over your relative.

**Facebook**

While this might be harder given that you don't have access to their account, on their phone, you do have access to their feed by sending them content.

You need to compete with the fifty Qanon cult members feeding them radicalizing material and while that might sound daunting remember that you are their loved one, the other strangers on Facebook have no real connection to them other than the cult.

If you can, team up with other members of your family and your relative's friends to organize a gradual weaning away from the cult.

Consider building a team of people who will help you with this intervention, the more you have to assist you the easier this will be. Don't try to take everything on yourself.

As with the example for YouTube, pick something you believe they'll be interested in (cat videos, of course). Agree that you'll all look for a new video every day and send your loved one the link to it on Facebook. Join Facebook groups in your chosen theme and start sharing posts from it with your loved one. Find memes to post and tag them.

Of course you need to be subtle about it. Start out on your own, but tag other friends and family in the post as you go. Just keep it relaxed ""You should see this! So funny!"" your friend or relative on the team can back it up, get involved, start talking about it, share another one etc.

Start out slow, maybe begin with just you and a friend/relative, then a week later quietly ask another to help out and tag them in on the next post, and so on.

Just make sure the friends/relatives you approach to join the ""intervention team"" aren't invested in Q also.

Gradually this will divert their attention away from the unfulfilling Q cult they have immersed themselves in, while they themselves are indicating to the algorithms on both platforms that their interests have changed.

It doesn't even take long for this change to happen. Within a couple of days there's a good chance their media consumption could completely shift from Q to Cats.

Both platforms NEED your attention. They don't wait months, weeks or even days to start delivering what their algorithms think you want to see. As soon as your relative shows an interest in a subject other than Q the algorithms shift with it, the more they then click on what is suggested the more will be delivered, and the less Q will be seen.

**In conclusion**

The algorithms on these platforms didn't have to work hard to lure your relative in. One click was likely all it took. With few alternative interests ready to intercept this programming that one click then told the algorithms to deliver more, and more, and more.

Once you start to break the hold those algorithms have on your loved one you'll probably start to see a change within days.

I'll admit that I've been a proponent of abandoning those who succumbed to the cult, because they can indeed be dangerous. However, it could take you and a few friends just an hour a day of sourcing alternative media and messaging to wean them out of this cult, and surely they're worth that.

So what do you say?

Are you gonna recruit the cats to deprogram your loved one?

So, don't give up on them. Let the cats radicalize them away from Q.",QAnonCasualties

It started with stuff I *could* believe. (Not saying I did, but it didn't sound far off at all) it started with human trafficking and I know its bad right now to. I stood behind her with that, but it slowly grew more and more odd and I cant even distinguish her anymore.
It went from human trafficking in hollywood, to blood sacrifices, demonic intentions of celebrities, illuminati, and worse and worse until one day she asked me if I thought the would was flat or round!
She seems to fully believes that the world's flat, the moons fake, we live in a simulation, lots of celebrities are dead and replaced with clones! She asked if I knew about lizard people???
I miss her, I miss her so so much and it feels like she's no longer there.

591,He HaS a FaMiLy,"I haven't seen my family since 2004. I don't call my parents on holidays or birthdays. I don't call them at all. Every few years when they call me, when I see it's them calling, I instantly feel dread and want to ignore the call. But I pick it up, listen politely to who's died or whatever the news is, try to make some kind of small talk that won't set them off, and hope to get off the call before it blows up.

The last time I talked to my dad I asked about a relative's old house in Flint, Michigan, and how I thought they were going to sell it, and how was that going since the water crisis. I didn't anticipate the existence of the Flint water crisis was controversial in itself - I got a whole raging earful about how there was no water crisis in Flint, Michael Moore made it up just to embarrass Flint, plenty of other cities have lead in their water, and lead isn't bad for you anyway.

Pretty sure ol' pops remembers I used to work in environmental science. Which just makes me more of the enemy, right, and he's letting me know he's on to *my* bullshit. Well, OK then. It's not Flint or lead he's really pissed about, it's that I'm a traitor.

When I was a kid, he always talked about how much Archie Bunker was his hero. When Rush Limbaugh became a thing, that became his thing. I tried to ignore it. When I used to go home for holidays I politely asked for matters of religion and politics to not be discussed over dinner, which was agreed to, and then shortly forgotten. I'd just try to eat as fast as possible and leave. I try to avoid letting them know my ideas on religion or politics, and as far as I know, they only know I'm not on their side and therefore the enemy.

And now, what would I even talk to them about? Not only is it a strain to stumble through a small talk minefield, trying to avoid a topic that'll set them off... what's left after that? There's nothing I want them to know about my life because they're only listening for something to get upset about, and if I wanna know what they have to say, all I gotta do is go look at the wackjob right-wing media of the day. It'd be nice to just hear updates on how people are doing, but if I also gotta listen to hateful bullshit directed at me, it's not worth it.

I assume they probably fell into the Q hole, but either way, I can draw a straight line of fascists and hatemongers and conspiracy theorists from Father Coughlin to Rush Limbaugh to QAnon, and it's all essentially the same thing. My family were just always early adopters.

I posted this article, [Twilight of the Assholes](https://christopherkirk.substack.com/p/twilight-of-the-assholes), on Facebook - it's a goodbye fuck-you to Rush Limbaugh. I woke up this morning to a comment on it from an old high school buddy who said he didn't necessarily agree with all of it, but he liked it, except the title was too harsh because Rush *has a family*.

I thought of a lot of things I could have responded with, but ultimately, I decided the best thing was to just delete the comment so nobody else starts arguing and try to get on with my day. He doesn't get it and I'm not going to spend my day debating on Facebook about it. But not gonna lie, it pissed me off, and here I am wasting time on it anyway, for one reason I think people here understand:

595,Crowdfunded research to counter Q,"Hoping to share some info a new research effort that could be of benefit to this community. Additional background on this project is below and you can find more info about how to support this campaign on the Harmony Labs website.

Existing inquiry into QAnon has largely been driven by surveys, ethnography, and journalistic reporting yet little is known *at scale* about QAnon‚Äôs loosely affiliated community. Many people working to counter this extremism can‚Äôt afford the research they need to know where to go next.

One-off, fast-moving research projects can be invaluable to understanding, responding to, and counteracting cultural trends in real-time, but are often challenging to fund. That‚Äôs why we ([Harmony Labs](https://harmonylabs.org/)) just launched a new Kickstarter campaign to provide the research media companies, journalists, storytellers, and concerned friends and family of QAnon believers need to address QAnon online.

This research will be carried out rapidly and in full public view, with transparency of analysis, results, and datasets, and with direct input from supporters of the campaign. The project will produce a fully designed, interactive, public website to ensure findings are easy to use, accessible, and actionable. In this way, we can start equipping people with the tools and resources they need to counter Q.

We would appreciate any support and feedback this community has to offer. You can find out more on our website or find our campaign on the Kickstarter website.",QAnonCasualties
596,In-law rant,"My wife and to a lesser extent her sister don‚Äôt know what to make of their mom these days. She said her mom once was a big believer in this obvious hoax religion maybe 10+ years ago and ordered books and sent money to the religious leader guy who turned around and bought an island or something, so she seems susceptible to conspiracies. 

Then came Trump and Q. She spouts the anti vax George Soros global puppet master kind of rhetoric and now is readying for the apocalypse and Biden will any day turn this country over to China. My wife has tried to have conversations but the mom is combative and is quick to anger and then throws insults like snowflake and then gets to cursing and my wife can‚Äôt really talk her down from it.

‚ÄúMom I still love you and we don‚Äôt have to talk about this stuff if it upsets you and we don‚Äôt have to agree on everything‚Äù is where my wife tries to end it when it gets futile, but recently her mom upped the ante and chastised her for not christening our kids and how they‚Äôll be godless antifa snowflakes out to cancel every republican just like us.

Her dad doesn‚Äôt agree or disagree but tries to mediate and mostly just keep her mom from getting more irate, but at this rate I don‚Äôt know what else can be done. My wife‚Äôs grandmother had dementia kind of early and became irate easily every afternoon and couldn‚Äôt really be around a group of people or family without shutting down or just yelling weird shit out of nowhere.

Between qanon stuff and trying to support her through possible dementia signs (forgetting day and time, losing train of thought mid sentence, forgetting key steps when cooking, etc), we‚Äôre really at a loss in terms of repairing the relationship and staying close should her condition worsen. 

My wife is worried that this stuff has become fixed and her mom will go downhill with this negative and nasty view of her.

I recently joined a Reddit community revolving around a financial movement. It sucked me in and resulted in me making financial decisions. I noticed as the sub grew that a phrase kept popping up: WWG1WGA. I googled it and saw it was tied to QAnon. Then I started seeing posts about reporters being AI and not real people. I googled the reporters and of course they‚Äôre real people with real bios and real social media accounts going back a decade. Then I started noticing some very extreme religious rhetoric. I feel like something I got in to as a hobby/financial investment is very Q adjacent. I asked members what they thought and I was called a reporter in disguise, a straw man, and a traitor. This isn‚Äôt a political community, or at least that‚Äôs not what it is labeled as. Am I overreacting or does this have some Q adjacent stuff going on?",QAnonCasualties
599,I‚Äôm worried that my mom is losing herself to conspiracy theories.,"She was already pretty convinced that COVID was engineered in Wuhan and that it may or may not have been released by accident. She definitely believes some of the election fraud claims, but not all of them. Her in laws (she‚Äôs married to a trumper with very extreme right parents) have definitely fed her some stuff. She does fact check things, but she has certain websites she fact checks, and doesn‚Äôt trust outside sites.

Last night my step grandpa had a heart attack and was hospitalized. It happened late at night, so she woke me up and told me and then she and my step dad left me at home so they could meet the ambulance. The next morning I asked her how he was.

She immediately launched into how he got the vaccine so that‚Äôs what caused his heart attack. Not that he‚Äôs 90 years old and weighed over 300 lbs most of his life. She was telling me all this stuff about the vaccine and she didn‚Äôt even tell me if he was alive or dead until I stopped her and asked about his condition. He‚Äôs alive and it looks like he‚Äôll be ok, but we‚Äôre pretty rural so we won‚Äôt know the extent of the damage until he sees a cardiologist in the city today.

The local doctor was saying that probably he had a blood clot that became loose for one reason or another, she isn‚Äôt sure. My mom is convinced that the vaccine caused the heart attack and seemed to doubt the existence of the clot as she talked about it. She was really upset only his wife, my step grandma, could go see him, and that she refused to record the doctor to show her after what they said.

It‚Äôs scary to me that that‚Äôs the first place her mind jumped. She‚Äôs normally such a smart person who doesn‚Äôt lend a lot of credence to conspiracy theories at all. We‚Äôve had like at length conversations about internalized racial bias and the prison industrial complex for fuck‚Äôs sake.

What even can I do? It‚Äôs not like she watches Fox News or gets her info from Facebook. I think she‚Äôs scared and lost in the state of the world like the rest of us and is in danger of falling into toxic ways of coping with those feelings.

It isn‚Äôt like she‚Äôs hard into QAnon or anything‚Äî but I‚Äôm worried she might fall into that, too, as she gets deeper and deeper.",QAnonCasualties

601,"I spent another month documenting QAnon believers and influencers on Gab, to see how they were evolving during the first month of Biden's presidency","Hey there, guys. I'm a journalist who couldn't help but become fascinated by QAnon in the months leading up to the election. I rarely write about ""politics,"" but I couldn't help myself from falling down the rabbit hole of wanting to document QAnon, because it strikes me as the most important sociological pitfall of our current age. To that end, I spent months between Nov. 3 and Inauguration Day chronicling QAnon beliefs and deconstructing them on sites such as Parler and Gab. I posted that piece here a month ago and got lots of really great feedback and support. It was this piece, here. 

https://www.pastemagazine.com/politics/qanon/qanon-trump-parler-gab-conspiracy-theories-inauguration-day/

I sort of hoped that this would be the end of my spending so much time reading QAnon rants on Gab, but it didn't take long before I came to feel like I needed to do it one more time, in order to capture how the vibe of QAnon communities is continuing to evolve during Biden's actual presidency. I wanted to see how they were all coping/rationalizing/raging during this period, when any person looking at the situation dispassionately would be able to conclude that Trump had lost.

Suffice to say, the QAnon believers who are still there have just dug themselves in deeper, but that's to be expected. There are all kinds of crazy new conspiracy theories, etc., etc. But I also feel like a lot of Q believers have been dealt a big blow, and I think many of them have melted away from these communities. There's a feeling that they're incredibly fractured last now, given the lack of central leadership. Different groups within QAnon believe vastly different things, and infighting is common. It seems to suggest they'll have an increasing difficulty uniting on anything.

Anyway. Here is the result of spending the last month continuing to read thousands of QAnon posts on Gab, etc.

602,Yesterday my Q-Dad Figured out I was Going to get the Vaccine,"This started all because my Ex-Q sister told him that I was going to get the vaccine. The conversation with my Dad mainly consisted of me providing points from peer-reviewed research papers and disproving the ""shaking"" videos on FB, while he cussed me out, called the vaccine ""FUCKING POISON"", and called the articles propaganda. I will admit as the conversation progressed, I did get more and more childish, saying I would lick the vaccine site a few times for good measure and send him pictures of my getting the vaccine along with necessary paperwork that went along with it. This was all last night. In the morning, I woke up to an article on Mark Zuckerberg's opinion of the vaccine that he sent me. How do I end this madness that my sister started? She apologized last night because I don't think she realized that telling him would result in him immediately cussing me out. From this whole encounter, I am even more tempted to get the vaccine earlier than I would have gotten otherwise. I am also very tempted to post a fake article to one of my dad's sites to show him, ""literally anyone can do it, the standards are very low"".",QAnonCasualties
603,Troubling Mom update,"So Mom was pretty cool about chilling out and not bringing up Q for a while. Of course, it took me freaking out on her to get to that point, but I that's beside the issue. She started again about 2 days ago. She called losing it about the pandemic, and how she's so tired of wearing a mask, and how the vaccine is a personal choice so her patients need to STOP ASKING HER IF SHE'S HAD IT!!!!! Which is absolutely crazy because she's a dental hygienist. And yes, before you go digging around in my mouth, I'd really prefer you to have been vaccinated against a potentially deadly airborne pathogen. Then she started in with the typical copy and paste Q stuff about child trafficking. 

But as my wife and I were headed out for service, my brother called and told me something really disturbing. Apparently her husband has had to hide his adderall prescription from her. He said she doesn't take it regularly, but she often takes it for no reason whatsoever. Would explain the bizarre, manic behavior I've observed on a few occasions. But what worries me is this: I know that sort of thing is a slippery slope. After watching my sister's slide into addiction, SHE should know it. When that adderall stops working, she's likely to seek other ways of getting that feeling. And she lives in a county that's been repeatedly called ""The Meth Capital of Georgia.""",QAnonCasualties

605,My dad quietly deprogrammed my mom,"Sorry for my poor english, I am not from the USA and I do not regularly use reddit so this is also just an account I made for this one post, I hope that is okay. 

I just found out very recently that my mother has been becoming a Q follower over the last couple of  years and how my 65 year old dad has managed to quietly deprogram her on her own without anybody of us knowing. My mom has always believed in weird things like healing crystals but as far as I know she never went overboard with it. She was always a ""If you have a fever a crystal will help but if it's worse go to the doctor immediately"" kinda person. But she fell deep into a q hole around 2017/8. She never really talked about it with us outside of some ""deep state"" comments which don't really mean anything where I live so we just ignored it. ""It's just a phase"" came up very often. But it was way worse than we thought.

However my dad was not taking this. He, all by himself, figured out how to block websites, lock tv channels etc. This might not sound like much but my dad is the MOST dad when it comes to computers. He is the kind of dad who regularly calls me and asks how to create folders etc. He hates computers. But he spent months, literally actual months, figuring this all out by himself. He blocked Facebook and other weird Q sites (including reddit), blocked Youtube channels and replaced them with progressively less stupid ones (going from conspiracy theories to healing crystal channels and then to Opera and cooking channels etc.). He also did whatever he could to keep her from the computer, going on weekend trips and (before covid) even taking her to the Opera. My mom always wanted to go but my dad *HATES* it. I don't think words can describe how much he hates the Opera. Still does. And yet he took her there as often as he could afford it. And signed her up on Opera forums just so she would spend more time talking with these harmless people instead.   
Again, I cannot stress enough how impressive it is that my dad accomplished this. My dad who once asked me if you need the internet to receive e-mails.

I bet you are now asking ""Why didn't he asked you for help?"". Thing is, I had no idea this was going on. I see my parents somewhat regularly but again, some weird comments aside my mom never really said anything about Q. And we don't talk about politics at all. I only found out about all of this happening by accident (I won't get into details here, it's long and not that interesting tbh)

So, why did my dad not say anything? When he told me everything he had done he said he didn't want us (my sisters and me) to think bad of my mother. I cannot even describe how I felt when he said that. I'm not sure a word for this feeling exists. It's somewhere between heartbroken because we left him alone doing all this but also warm because he cared so much but also frightened because it could have all gone wrong as well.  
My mom is now pretty much back to normal and now that we know she is talking about her experiences a lot with us, even tho she is clearly ashamed of herself (obviously we constantly tell her how proud of her we are and that she doesn't need to be ashamed anymore). She has deleted her Facebook account and has completely cut out real life Q ""friends"" she met during her Q time from her life.

607,Is Q-fam lost or is there a chance? Neutral voice of reason &amp; rational/logical thinking but all my Q-contrary &amp; debunking evidence is 'run by the cabal/libs/dems!‚Äô,"I feel for a lot of members within this sub. I'm fortunate in the sense my family has not (yet) exiled me for voicing my opinions (or rather facts) when it comes to debunking their Q related claims. For example the latest claim was ""Spongebob's address is the same as Epstein's pedo-park in the Virgin Islands!"" This was of course already debunked and upon trying to explain how several sites detailed how someone simply edited the address to that of Spongebob's üçç 124 Conch Street via Google Maps they refuse to accept my proof and state that all of the sites or articles (20+) I used for reference and evidence to debunk this claim are ""run by the cabal and liberals."" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I continue to try and be the neutral voice of rational and logical thinking but every time I attempt to prove their Q related claims are false the evidence is never good enough! I know they want to believe everything they read regarding Q is true because it's not only what they WANT to believe but also what they HOPE is true and fact. (Sounds like a liberal but I'll not say THAT to them...yet) Unfortunately such belief of these frivolous claims and disputing all concrete evidence is where their rational thinking ends.

Now it's their belief/hope (or let them tell it: what's GOING to happen without a doubt) the Supreme Court is going to overturn the election results this Friday 2/19/21. After reminding them the SC has already dismissed several states cases regarding election fraud they then proceed to claim the military will overturn the election if the SC doesn't. They also believe the military is in control of the country, Biden is incarcerated and speaking from a movie set within a cell (possibly Gitmo from what they gather) it's the usual Qniverse claims that have mislead so many others already. Of course if none of the above actually comes to play out then ""Trump will be inaugurated come March 4th!"" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I will still continue to be the neutral voice of reason and rationality, but what more can I do to try and get them to drink less of the red Kool-Aid, pop fewer red pills, and start RESEARCHING some of these claims made by Q or others in the internet? As I said, just because you believe it's true and hope it's truth doesn't mean that it's actually true! But I honestly don't know how to go about getting them to fall back and straddle the fence by researching BOTH sides of the story before automatically jumping to the conclusion it's 100% fact or going to happen solely because it's what they WANT to happen and be true.

I've already labeled them Qanon Casualties (which they hate because Q is law) but in the same breath I have a slight feeling of hope because come 3/4/21 when nothing happens and it's just another day I'm hoping they realize 'hey...maybe Q was wrong and not everything Q claims is true.' Only time will tell but I have hope they will start to return to their senses and think RATIONALLY once they realize they have no choice but to accept the reality they're living in and stop believing everything they want to believe on the internet is actually canon and fact just because they want it to be true and play out. Nothing but a false sense of hope and security!

TLDR: Fam believes literally everything Q says is fact and true because it's what they want to be fact and true. But they don't research anything and refuse to believe anything that contradicts any Q claims even when the evidence or debunk is concrete solid and proven fact. How can I get them to start researching before jumping to the conclusion everything they read is true solely because it's what they want to be true? Or is this a lost cause and have I already lost them to Q entirely?",QAnonCasualties
608,"I ""accidentally"" dropped a tip to my local news station about a certain chiropractor promoting vaccine hesitancy/denial to clients (my father). I still can't prove they are sending clients insane videos about nano-technology in the vaccines and COVAIDS, but what should I say if they respond?","I went on the local news station vaccine tip page for sharing tips. I started to fill out a tip form just to see what info they were looking for. I was expecting a longer form to complete but as soon as I filled out the topic, ""Chiropractors promoting vaccine skepticism"" I hit next and got a message saying thanks for the tip. We will be in touch if we need more information. Woops. I provided no specific details.

If they reach out I'm thinking it's ok to say:

*""My father recently texted the family a very concerning anti-vaccine video that he said was from his ""doctor"". I looked up one of the clinics he visits which is actually a chiropractor's office that promotes anti-vax sentiments. I think he is referring to his chiropractor when he texted the video. I am not accusing anybody of anything and I don't know for sure that this chiropractor has actually scared my father or others away from getting vaccinated, but they are promoting anti-vax messages and debunked and/or banned from YouTube videos on their website. I thought it was something newsworthy and important that there are health professionals promoting anti-vaccination misinformation during the pandemic. Please do what you like with this information I'm providing and keep this tip anonymous.""*

I **DO NOT** want to accuse anybody of doing something I cannot prove such as sending direct to clients bizarre videos about the vaccine. I do not want to slander anybody or damage their business with something I cannot prove and might be entirely wrong about. I do know what they have to say about vaccines on their very public website though. 

It may be this chiropractor's right to promote vaccine skepticism and if it is, so be it.  But he is pushing anti-vax info on his website so that's public knowledge. Maybe he even thinks it's good for his business?  A ""health"" professional promoting anti-vax views at this time is pretty newsworthy in my opinion and if he gets shamed into keeping his vaccine opinions to himself in the future then that's a win. If he's breaking any regulations then shame on him. 

The bonus is that I accidentally tipped off the station my father watches in the morning.

I feel a little guilty, but getting called out could save a life or two. And yeah, they also promote a lot of other pseudoscientific services and products that are bogus.

&gt;My family immigrated to the US from Italy in the 30‚Äôs. They worked in the mines of Appalachia because this was the work they knew and were skilled at.  Fast forward to the second generation‚Ä¶ Our family has been split down the middle by QAnon. Some of us chose to continue the families love for adventure and exploration by traveling and extending our boundaries beyond the borders of WV and Pennsylvania, and some decided to stay. The ones that left, are mostly left leaning moderate Catholics who respect all cultures and religions, it‚Äôs just how we were raised; however, the ones that stayed behind, adopted a more local mind set and political views. Now, I have no animosity toward family members staying local, but mention this only to give context to the current Q situation within my family or clan.  The Q mythos has completely absorbed a good portion of my family. More the second generation than the first. The first generation still held true to the ethics and values of their parents. But something happened to the second generation, they became more nationalistic, xenophobic and racist, completely forgetting where they came from. I attribute this to the lack of struggle and pain our grandparents felt.  Enter Q‚Ä¶ about half of my family has gone to the dark side but the worst has to be my Q-ousin and his wife. They have never, except for an occasional trip to the Outer banks of NC, left the borders of WV. They believe deeply in Pizza gate; the election was stolen and anyone not a trump supporter is a communist satanic homosexual pedophile who kills babies to drink their blood. I am ashamed and astounded that they really believe this!  I can go on and on but the bottom line is that Q preys on the weak and uneducated (Nothing to do with formal education) ‚Ä¶ the ones who have never experienced outside stimuli and cultures.

621,Can we save Q/conspiracy people by click-baiting them into actual research?,"Hi all. I've faced the similar struggle as many of you of losing a loved one to conspiracy theories. I'll spare you the details about how it's negatively impacted me. But I just made this burner account to post here because today, I came up with a rough idea that could possibly help pull our people out this mania. 

Like many of you, my lost one's ego and livelihood is fueled by ""doing research"" and ""knowing things"" that other people don't. ""Sorry sheep, I'm on a different level than you, you haven't read the papers or done the research,"" they've told me and others close to them. Today, they texted me yet another disoriented bitchute video about why we need to fear the covid vaccine. After watching, and politely refuting a few points in the video with medical journal research available online, I came to realize a few things about how/why they consume misinformation and how we could possibly combat it:

1.) Many of these people will not trust or consider things that are not on media channels like bitchute.

2.) They NEED to feel like they are discovering information themselves that ""other people"" don't know about.

3.) Clickbait titles that scream ""Oh my god!!! X is going to happen if Y and no one is talking about it!!""

4.) The life values presented in the videos are valid much of the time.

Each conspiracy theory video appeals to their values, like freedom, which many sane Americans can agree with and relate to. These values are totally valid. For example, the antivax video I got sent today opened with a solid philosophical argument about informed medical consent, which is important. However, the problem with antivaxers as you know, is that they are not properly informed. So we could take a ""get informed, don't let them give you the jab without the facts"" approach by click-baiting them into \*actual\* research on their preferred channels. For example, we could upload actual educational videos with clickbait titles to bitchute with legit videos about how vaccines work. Like scare the shit out of people into actually learning something real to pull them out. ""They don't want you to know Pfizer's mRNA vaccine does THIS to your cells!!"" And then the bitchute video can be an immunologist first appealing to their values describing how it's important to have informed medical consent/freedom and then can go into the specific science about how mRNA vaccines actually interact with your cells.

Do you think posting on their media channels in this way is a good idea? Why or why not? What holes am I missing here? What other ideas do you have related to this? How could we go about something like this? Thanks!",QAnonCasualties

623,Documentarian-Would like your help," (I was approved to post, though I'm not sure how to add the tag...)

Hello friends: 

I am a communication educator at a small community college in Hillsboro, MO. For reference, it‚Äôs about 30 min south of St. Louis. For promotion, I am completing a second master‚Äôs degree in New Media Production. For my Master‚Äôs thesis I wanted to create something that would help people, so I am creating a documentary, and I could use your help. 

While there has been reporting on Qanon and the rift it‚Äôs caused within families, there has been little work on how we might work to help bring people back toward the middle of the political spectrum. I‚Äôve enlisted a group of social workers to help me with specific tactics that we can teach to family members who want to try and help reach their Qanon/extremist family members. 

Here is what I am looking for if anyone here is interested: 

\-People willing to be interviewed through zoom on the effect that political polarization has had on you and your family- This can be from anywhere as I can do this through Zoom.

\-People in the Greater St. Louis area who might be willing to undergo training from these experts and are willing to then reach out to their family member using the skills

\-Information on any other experts or people who might want to speak with me

If you want more information on what would be involved in the documentary, or if you have any other questions, please message me, or if you like, you can email me at [lisamariepavia@gmail.com](mailto:lisamariepavia@gmail.com)",QAnonCasualties

He used to be my best friend. Best grandfather to my kids. Spend 50 percent of his time at our home, he even has a room (guest room but his stuff in the closet).

But he hasn't called me in a month and a half. He answers my call maybe half the time. And always is brief because some new news  is breaking.

625,You can't fight hate with hate. It just makes more hate.,"The title is self explanatory and most on here are not hating but sharing their experiences. However there is a hate growing in some of these threads for anyone right wing and a growing culture that assumes everyone right if center is part of Q. May I just remind everyone that these are our neighbors and friends and family members. My roommate is still struggling with Q, my parents are spouting things that clearly originated from Q even though they don't even seem to know what exactly Q is. 
These people are not going to just die or disappear so beating them into the ground with hatred is only going to push them further away, I like my roommate even if I dont like his politics, I want to be able to put politics aside and just be friends, and even more than that I want to be able to discuss political views, agree or disagree, then put it away when we are done and be able to still see each other as morally gray, imperfect people who have been the hero and the villain in different situations through out their lives.
Here's an exercise that's healthy to try: think back and try to remember a time when you were the bad guy, times when you were wrong and would not admit it. Can you imagine fighting passionately for a cause that you think is for the greater good and then come to realize you've been part of something ugly or even evil? 
The cheering of Rush Limbaugh's death is an ugly sight, he was no angel but certainly not evil either, and I'm surprised at how it becomes ok to hate someone who's views are problematic even when they are dead dancing on their graves like it's some great victory. I'd expect that response to the death of Ted Bundy but not a political commentator, even if sometimes he was outright wrong, even morally wrong to say atrocious things. 
I invite everyone to think of a person as a 4 dimensional being. A physical, mental, spiritual and time dimension is a jungian way of seeing people. Theres the you from 10 years ago, the you today and the you that could be tomorrow or 10 years from now. 
People need to be allowed to make mistakes and come back from that with acceptance, if they admit they were wrong and you throw it in their face they will never admit to being wrong ever again and they wont listen to you either. 
""May he who is with out sin cast the first stone""  
Let's find ways to make things better, not worse.

639,Qanon has gotten to my sister," 

Hello Everyone. I'm just hear to vent about how Qanon has completely taken over my sister's life.

My sister and I didn't always have the easiest relationship. She was definitely more emotional, took things personally, and acted on emotions and a bit paranoid while I would always joke around, not serious (which annoyed her but also other people in my family) be more logical, and try to put everything in perspective and find a solution. This is not to say she didn't have great qualities, she was also really funny and we would sometimes be going back and forth with jokes that left our family laughing for hours. She would also care a lot for animals and people and didn't let people bs or lie when she was around.

But as grew older we grew more separate (like most siblings) I studied in America and she did as well but she came back to the Netherlands a year before me to study her Masters and I did the same as well. I only started to see a change in her when I came back and she came to visit me. We were just talking and she just starting about being Christian and how abortion is bad. Now that wasn't a red flag or anything for me but it was very surprising because our family was always non religious and the closest person being religious was me growing up somewhat following Islam. But I thought fine if she is happy then I'm happy and the rest of the trip went fine.

What happened next came more from my mother who expressed concerns with stuff my sister would tell her. I didn't it myself because we would usually make jokes with each other and never get serious. She was telling me about how she was becoming more anti vaccination and that she didn't believe the world was round. So when they visited me again during dinner I was very surprised to hear it myself because I didn't believe it and that also she believed that they were using aeroplanes to kill us. I remember distinctly her saying that she doesn't believe anything NASA says but then I said ""you know other countries have satellites in space as well right"" and she went quiet because she didn't have an answer for that and she added that there was a plane that had shown data that the earth wasn't round but then I just said""10s of thousands of planes fly every year around the earth, wouldn't they see that then as well"" I also went on about how gravity and physics wouldn't work how we know it then and that was the end of it. She didn't have arguments for it so I thought it was done. My mother and I talked after that about how strange that she would think that especially since they were so different than what she believed before.

A lot of things happened inbetween including multiple shouting matches with backing Trump and talking about how democrats are the devil and also backing a politicalparty here in the Netherlands that is big into conspiracy theories but the breaking point was with something that happened to me. While I was living in America I had a bad encounter with the police and with myself being black and the other person being white and almost being arrested myself for saving a woman from that guy but luckily there were many witnesses who supported me and shouted to the cops what really happened (don't want to get real into it) So when George Floyd happened I decided to share my story on facebook. I went to my family (including my sister) to help me formulate my story so it wasn't confusing. Now I told this story to my sister years before and she believed me then and was fighting for me but she has changed her mind. She was talking about how perspectives are different and that her perspective was different from mine. Well that was complete bullshit since she wasn't there and that was just another way of saying I don't believe you anymore. I'm not a shouty person so I just told that I don't think we should speak anymore. I haven't spoken to her since then and I really don't plan to. One of the things growing up that we both really struggled with was race and how having a white mother and black father was being too white for the black kids and too black for the white kids. She was so adamantly anti racist and was always my voice as my big sister growing up against it. And for her to turn on me on one of the most traumatic things I have experienced was too much and I couldnt do it anymore.

My mother still holds onto hope that she can reach her and every time she talks to me about her I try to support her and not show my true feelings that I think she is gone. My sister is almost 30 now with no job and no real plan to get one and still needs my parents to help her with the smallest things. Not sure if she takes care of herself but she has no friends and just talks to this boy from Texas and said that she would move there. I really only get emotional now because I'm afraid by the time my mother passes away my sister will be in the same spot or worse and that she couldn't save her. My mother is honestly the sweetest person in the world and I don't want her heart broken.

641,"America's Frontline ""Doctors"" and the viral video by Simone Gold - Advice for debunking vaccine skeptics (even when they are doctors)","I'm not sure what to do anymore. My dad and I have been at odds for the past 4 years over Trumpism, gradually getting worse each year. However these last couple months since Biden was elected and took office, I was beginning to see a light at the end of this dark MAGA red tunnel. My dad was more himself and filled with less hate, negativity and skepticism. Things were looking up. He recently won his battle with cancer a couple months ago and had his last chemo treatment in the fall. He is eligible for the vaccine and was excited about it - even had his appointment made. Then last week he watched a viral video from Simone Gold (America's Frontline ""Doctors"") and now has changed his mind. It was a 50 minute long video about how the vaccine is experimental (like of course it is? most of medicine is) and how it can cause infertility and then *casually* mentions government tracking (OK). My dad sent this link to me and it only took a quick google search to find out besides spreading vaccine misinformation, she was also arrested for being involved in the capitol attack (shocker). I sent various links to these articles and all he did was get mad at me. 

He was never on the full QAnon train and really never bought into conspiracies before. He watches Fox News but doesn't have any social media. He's normally practical and on the positive side of everything. He was a big Trumper but him not accepting defeat with grace - and then the Capitol attack really opened his eyes (though he would never admit it). He's middle of the road, not too far down the conspiracy rabbit hole yet. Does anyone have any tips for debunking a doctor like **Simone Gold?** Or have had any similar experiences with **America's Frontline Doctors?** I can't believe this is the first I'm hearing of this organization or group or whatever they are. 

My intent isn't to trick him into anything, I want him to WANT to get this vaccine and to see the truth again but it is a constant battle against misinformation and his friends who believe in this shit. I love him very much and worry this video could cost him his life. Any advice is helpful!",QAnonCasualties
642,Family fractured by Q - Feeling hopeless,"In just one year I have lost my mother -- once a vibrant, kind, empathetic soul -- to the bowels of Parler and the conspiracies that abound. She has tried to convince me not to get vaccinated, my sister has called me a pedophile, and before the inauguration they tried to force me onto signal because they were convinced we would lose contact. The two of them have shrivelled away into paranoid, angry, and delusional people with no sense of reality. My Mom doesn't work, she's married to my amazing father who has supported her with a very comfortable life for years. And yet she's acting like the end of the world is upon us. It's infuriating to see someone who is so privileged acting like this.   


I'm despondent because I live in Mexico and have not seen them in quite some time. No one except for my father calls me to ask how I'm doing, how my job is going, whether I'm healthy, etc. The only time we have contact is if I call them, in which case I have to bite my tongue the entire time. My father has expressed that the situation with my mom is really bad -- for the first time in my life I wonder if there's a possibility that they will divorce. There's not much for them to talk about anymore.   


We thought that after the inauguration they would calm down. But in my last conversation with my mother I could tell she still believes ""something"" is going to happen.

645,Just got disowned,"I don't know if this is the right place to post but it seemed like the closest thing. I disowned by my father yesterday due to my support of the BLM movement in addition to some other things. I always assumed it would be because I am gay, or trans, or because I was planning never to have children but no it was because I called him out for being violently racist and misogynistic and homophobic. Then he called me an n-word lover and told me to go to *predominantly black neighborhood near me* and become a pr// stitute for them since I loved them so much and disowned me. 

I don't think he is a q believer but this is someone who genuinely admires Hitler and Trump. He wanted to join the proud boys but when I pointed out they would hate him (he's Chinese) he said I was getting brainwashed by my college and liberal media and that if I had two brain cells to rub together I would know that he was right. He didn't like it when I pointed out I would have more brain cells if he didn't you know smash my head into a window breaking it once and abuse me regularly as a child. Obviously it wasn't safe so I had to move out to live with my mom who luckily was already divorced.

Here's the kicker: my mom is a q believer. Although she is a better person than my dad, she saw this as an opportunity to get me to see the light. I'm just absolutely exhausted by everything. This isn't the first time this has happened, my dad and I had a fight on election night as well and I ran to my mom but she and the rest of my family convinced me I was overreacting and that he didn't mean it, that me telling him he was being racist was the same thing as him telling me to become a who /// re. And as soon as I go back, this happens. 

At this point, I'm just numb. I'm not even upset that I just got disowned by a parent. I don't even see him as a parent anymore. I'm absolutely disgusted at this man and I have no sympathy for him at all. I even feel cleaner after being disowned.

I don't know if I can report them for what is on their website plain as day, or if that vaccine skeptic material is OK in my state, CO.

Here was the text sent to me and 5 others - *‚ÄúPlease, please, please listen to this as if you're life depends, on it, because it does. Sent from my Dr. to me. Please do not take a COVID test and especially the vaccine*!üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏ 

The Dr. my father refers to is most like his chiropractor, not an MD,  that runs an anti-aging and regenerative medical center. His website features anti-vax articles and attached to some  ""Freedom"" websites, videos starring Dr. Judy ""Plandemic"" Mikovits removed by YouTube, and videos from elsewhere. I know about the chiropractor and anti-vax connection already. I'm planning on calling the state medical board and regional chiropractor organization, but I don't have proof he sent anything directly to my father. 

 From the forwarded video:

&gt;  *""It's not a vaccine but a cellular GENETIC MODIFICATION technology, admittedly designed to give those ignorant enough to take it........ a self-creating AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE similar to what used to be called.......AIDS""* **COVIDS** transhuman, nano-technology, eugenics driven democide and genocide. We have all been duped by germ theory. Bill Gates is turning us into walking, talking cellphones, something about a horrific brain parasite and the nano-particles are apparently alive and will fight each other. And that's just the test. Mind control and DNA manipulation. 5G frequencies. Crypto slave wages.   **THEY ARE LITERALLY GIVING YOU AIDS.** 

Below is anti-vax content from the clinic website. I'm not sure what the state's laws are for chiropractors (D.C.)s regarding medical misinformation. The chiropractor is pretty comfortable putting this out there as pragmatic skepticism. The video I watched was something entirely different. 

&gt;As a healthcare professional that has been in private practice for almost 20 years it concerns me that our medical freedoms are under attack and our right to make informed medical decisions for ourselves and our family may be taken away.  
&gt;  
&gt;Imagine how you will feel when the day comes that you cannot make your own decision about a medical procedure being performed on you, your spouse, your child, your parents, your siblings!¬†  
&gt;  
&gt;What is wrong with asking questions?¬† Why is it so difficult to have an ‚Äòobjective‚Äô conversation about vaccines?¬† Why are we not looking at who is funding the research that is being pushed down our throats? Is that research industry funded?¬† Are there significant ‚Äòconflicts of interest‚Äô by the researchers or investors of the research?  
&gt;  
&gt;The point is, get involved in learning as much as youcan so you can make a more informed, objective and less emotional decision.for you and your family.¬† You just might be surprised at what you find out‚Ä¶..and you may help to thwart an attempt to take away more of your medical freedoms!

&gt;Here is a link (removed) to a powerful and educational docuseries called ‚ÄòThe Truth About Vaccines 2020‚Äô.¬† It will be FREE to view and it starts tonight. Episode 1 is called:¬†*‚ÄúThe History of Vaccines, Smallpox, Vaccine Safety &amp; the Current CDC Schedule.‚Äù*¬† Prepare to learn how vaccines came about, how they help or harm, and who‚Äôs ‚Äúpushing‚Äù you to get them.¬†

652,Lost my family ...,"In my journal, I wrote out the timeline of events that led to up to me finally leaving them, but it's pretty long and I don't know if it would be appropriate to post a novel here. I have very little experience with Reddit.

I've always had a toxic and abusive relationship with my parents but it was ultimately politics and conspiracies that dragged us down to the point of no return. It started with them flipping out about BLM, to BLM being antifa, to antifa and pedophiles destroying the country,  etc etc. This would start the moment I would walk in the door, from my grandmother and dad. I would have to leave the room or nod my head in silence to keep the peace. Sometimes I disassociated. The only reason I kept going over there was so my kids [3 years, 11 months] could see their grandparents. The first time my grandmother started acting out against them was the last straw, though- I decided at that point that I wasn't taking them over there anymore, which made me into the villain. There was a talk with my mom because we wanted to try to fix it but then the gaslighting and excuses for their behavior started and I realized that I lost her too. My brother is mentally disabled, so it took them no effort to feed him their conspiracies and turn him against me. Just like that, our bond was gone and he stopped talking to me ... he was the one I protected and cared about the most.

It's been 6 months since I last saw or spoke to them. I thought I would be feeling at least a little bit better by now. I don't regret cutting off communication at all because it was for mine and my kids wellbeing ... it's just that they weren't even the slightest bit upset that I left, and I think that's what hurts the most- like Trump and Q were more important than me and I just became the crazy, misinformed disappointment.

Anyway, thanks for letting me get it out. It blew my mind when I started learning that this has happened to so many other people. I'm trying to cope as best as I can, though some days are harder than others.",QAnonCasualties
653,"Sad, angry, scared...","This is a long rant/ask for help:

 Growing up in a small rural farm town, I couldn‚Äôt wait to leave for college. I remember life before 24hr news channels, and it was a much more simple time. My family would watch Dan Rather at the end of the day, and that was most of the news we would consume aside from the Today show in the mornings waiting to leave for school.

Sometime around the 2000 election, Fox News was always a fixture on the TV, ever present during dinner, breakfast, always on... and it got worse after 9/11. I remember getting scolded for changing the channel to MSNBC, ‚Äúyou liberals...‚Äù. I always loved my mom and step dad, and felt bad for them when they reacted like this. Similar to when my stepdad stopped me during dinner one night when I was discussing how I learned that dinosaur fossils were millions of years old, only for him to ‚Äúremind‚Äù me how the Earth was only 5,000 years old, and those fossils are tests of faith. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

I give all of this to you as context. This was my house growing up, and I somehow survived and broke free. 

My family had pressured me into joining the Navy to pay for college, and I had never truly felt that was the path for me. I was more interested in music, and played guitar in a metal band during high school. And yet, I found myself at the Military Entry Processing Station (MEPS) and inches away from signing my life over to the military. I froze, dropped the pen, and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I just can‚Äôt do this‚Äù. That setup one of the most awkward days of my life, having to sit in the lobby with other recruits while waiting to head back home (5 hr car ride, recruiter picked a few of us up). I was also the last to be dropped off. 

This was a departure from my family‚Äôs control over me, and where I finally started to assert myself and my views. Needless to say, things were never the same with my parents. As I went off to college in 2007, I didn‚Äôt understand that would be the last time my family would be whole. 

My mother‚Äôs health started to become an issue around 2009, and she was growing apart from my step dad. I had made a lot of friends at college, and I also had a job keeping me in town over the summer. I started to feel more at home in my college town than I did traveling back to the town I grew up in. 

2010, parents were divorced after an ugly couple years, and my mom was on her own for the first time since I was 3 years old. I also found her becoming more and more fascinated with conspiracy theories, and vehemently anti-Obama. This struck me as odd, as she was never so vocal with such hateful rhetoric. I‚Äôd grown used to the Fox News parroting, but this was on another level.

After college, I found work in another state on the west coast and moved with my girlfriend and son in 2013. My mom seldom would visit, although I would make it back several times a year.

Fast forward to 2015, and I‚Äôm getting very excited about Bernie Sanders, especially because of my moms poor health and her struggles with preexisting conditions and coverage. I called her to ask her what she thought, and was taken back by how enamored she was with Trump. It didn‚Äôt make any sense to me, this man was horrible with the things he said in public, and had no real policy from what I could tell. Never the less, my mom did the condescending ‚Äúoh son‚Äù bit and I decided to not get into it. To my absolute horror, Trump won the Presidency. 

My Facebook feed would constantly be filled with hateful fascist rhetoric from my mother and likeminded family. I couldn‚Äôt keep quiet. I had to say something, provide them links to facts. Somehow I had to show them they were being fed lies. This only served to disconnect me from them further. I was somehow ‚Äúindoctrinated‚Äù from going to college and daring to read books. 

My mom was now taking my sister to Trump rallies every time he would visit the state. They both wore their MAGA hats, and again to my horror, chanted ‚ÄúSend her back!‚Äù In regards to Ilhan Omar, and yelled obscenities at the local media covering the event (which my biological father was a part of and in attendance).

2020 was so bad. The worst. My mother eventually blocked me on Facebook, and started telling family how she was ‚Äúworried about me being radicalized‚Äù behind my back. My mother was immune compromised, had several bouts of chemotherapy, and was a smoker of 35+ years. 

I was paranoid she would get COVID, and sent her a box of 50 bottles of hand sanitizer after furiously refreshing on Amazon for hours. She was proud to not wear a mask when she went out. She even called me one day to vent about how she was ‚Äúaccosted by 3 elderly ladies in Walgreens for not wearing a mask when pickup up my prescriptions‚Äù. My mother had Graves‚Äô disease, and was not taking care of herself.

She was absolutely convinced that Trump would be arresting the Democrats and winning the election in a landslide. Except that didn‚Äôt happen, and I think it really shocked my mother. The election was called that Saturday after Pennsylvania was projected for Biden. My girlfriend and son were dancing, and it was a truly happy day here.

Two days later, I wake up to a bunch of missed calls from my sister. Mom had died early in the morning that Monday. She had a ‚Äúthyroid storm‚Äù and her body couldn‚Äôt take it. I flew over and helped my sisters clean up her apartment, and that‚Äôs when I learned how truly bad everything was.

We found her blood pressure monitor, sealed in the box, never used. Empty packs of cigarettes everywhere, even tough she told us she quit years ago. She had a QAnon phone case, a WWG1WGA sweater, and a collection of MAGA hats. I was floored. This had consumed my mother, and all came crashing down.

My sister is even more of an adherent to this QAnon cult since mom passed, and I am truly worried about her. I don‚Äôt know what to do, or even if it is worth my time. We are trying to plan a memorial for my mother, and my sister calls me the day after the Capitol riots and vents about how ‚ÄúAntifa stormed the Capitol‚Äù.... I told her she is living in a fantasy world and that I can‚Äôt deal with her at this time.

I know this was long, and I‚Äôm an emotional mess over all of this... does anyone have any recommendations or tips on how to break through to people who are so stuck on this QAnon propaganda?",QAnonCasualties
654,"Unpopular Opinion: I can understand Nazis and Confederates, but I can not for the life of me wrap my head around the QCult movement in America.","I don't agree with the confederates in the Civil War or the Nazis, obviously. But I can see how they got from A to B to C. Confederates wanted to protect their way of life and economy but did it in fucked up ways with slaves. Nazis needed someone to blame after WWI and a group that was an easy target for them was the Jewish population. Okay, it makes sense, on paper. Disgusting people doing disgusting things, but historically it follows.  


But then you get to QAnon and it's all lizard people, drinking baby blood, some anonymous dude named Q who speaks through riddles and numerology, Trump being some kind of Christian savior despite having more flaws than the antichrist and somehow enough people in a vaguely educated somewhat civilized society to start following this movement like lemmings over the cliffs of insanity.

655,Ex called me just to bitch at me about Trump. Haven't spoken to him since my birthday... when he bitched at me about Trump.,"I have an on-again/off-again friendship with my ex. Mostly, he's always been abusive but when he moved down to Floriduh, he went from being just a jerk to being a jerk who hoards guns obsessively (to the point where he complained when I bought him a ticket to come to Disney with me because he couldn't open carry there, ffs) and has gotten pretty scary. He's miserable, I can tell. Last time I was at his house, he was smoking heavily, talking about how he hated everyone, talking about how he was spending money he didn't have on buying more guns, and eventually tried to kick me out of his house only to beg me to stay when I finally had enough. His neighbor, one of his best friends, basically told me in a private conversation that he was done with him too because as the neighbor put it, ""he's not well"".   


On my birthday in October, he called me to... I guess, wish me Happy Birthday but ended up calling me a demo-drone and demo-rat after I asked him to stop talking about politics TWICE. Eventually, I had to cut him off (which I actually rarely do because I don't have the strength to say no to him usually-- but hey, I think Trump finally killed my last bit of love in my heart for him, so Trump did ONE good thing) and tell him, ""You know, I'm trying to have a happy birthday despite everything being closed... and talking to you is making it really hard to do that... so I'm gonna go... have a happy day... without you. Bye.""  


So I got a voicemail from him this weekend. Telling me Happy New Years' (in February, ffs) and telling me he hopes I'm okay. I tried to call back and hilariously (and because everything always has to be on his terms) it said my number was blocked. I know my FB and email are also blocked. So I sent him this from my new job's email and basically just had this annoying conversation with him:  


ME:(Subject titled: Why?)  What is the point of you leaving voicemails on my phone when you know you have me blocked on your phone? Either show up in my life or don't,¬†but I'm tired of¬†games like this. I tried to call you back only to listen to the recording telling me I'm blocked, so yeah, totally made my day. Thanks. I wish you well and hope you can find happiness somehow, but after what happened in January in Washington DC, I don't consort with terrorists.   


HIM:  Still under the glamour of those scumbags I see, that's why I new it was a mistake responding, oh well. Instead of happiness I wish the truth upon you, don't worry you won't hear from me again.¬†   


ME:  Again, I'm asking you to leave me alone. You scare me. I don't like whoever it is you've turned into with your guns and extremism. We had our issues before, but I don't even know who you are anymore. I don't think I love you like this anymore. I really hope you find happiness out there, but you really scare me right now. I don't care if you don't see it my way, but I'm super serious about it this time. You scare me, you're even angrier than before and I don't trust you like this. I'd like it if you left me alone please. \[Your neighbor\]  told me you're ""not well"" and we both agreed for my own safety that I stay away from you. He was very adamant about it and he seems to know you best. We both agreed you've become violent these past few years and have a paranoia streak going and have become obsessive about guns. I'm afraid of you. I've never been afraid of you before, but I am now and I'm asking you to just leave me alone please. You're not the person I loved. He's gone. I hope you figure out your stuff though. Truly, I do. We've had our differences before, but this is different. I have to stay away from you because I'm afraid you'll hurt me. I'm sorry.   


HIM:  I new it would be a mistake to attempt common curtesy, I didn't send you a rocking chair, you sent it to me. You are a brainwashed fueled by your fear the perfect puppet, a tool to destroy democracy, you cry about inequality but never think that you have set up a world of slaves and inequality. Lies, guilt and fear are all you deal in. I was feeling sorry for you, now I know your lost.¬† This is the last you will here from me, but some day you will know what a fool you have been and I wish you no mercy in your despair.¬† As for me, I have no regrets and have found happiness and true love in these dark times. I feel pity for future generations a race of slaves will be born.¬† PS stop trying to pretend you know anything about me, your warped sense of reality is the most dangerous thing their is, guns are not as dangerous as a bad idea, and you an your cronies have been doing your best at destroying freedom and democracy but like all tyrants your time of judgement shall come.¬†  


ME:  Goodbye \[his name\]. Don't contact me again. I honestly wish you hadn't the first time too. I don't love you anymore. I'm sorry.   


  
It's just.... ugh. I also have this photo of him from years ago that I keep thinking about. A car had gotten into an accident in front of his house because he lived on a busy road. I had my camera in my hand and decided to take some pictures to see if I could help them with insurance, ect. In the photo, everyone is rushing to this flipped car to see if the person is alright, while he's just standing there going through mail he just got out of the mailbox not even looking up. It's just that level of lack of empathy that I really think was there but that Trump and his alt right goons preyed on.

656,How to handle Qanon MIL,"Hello all -

I have reason to believe that my soon to be MIL is q. I have always knows she is conservative but having grown up with conservative family members this seems extreme to me. A few examples are she posts videos claiming that public officials are faking there covid vaccine. She references forces that are causing things in very criptic ways and her FB friends have said she is‚Äùawakened‚Äù she has also made several comments about how Bill Gates is behind things? I am not sure what that fully means.  Interestingly enough she has also in the past year suddenly become religious (christian) which I find interesting. I grew up Christian so its more so the sudden aspect that really surprises me.

I do not like her and she does not like me. She is an anti-masker and my partner(her son) called her out on it recently and said that they are important. She said basically ‚Äùsays who‚Äù and he listed my parents who are scientists in the medical field. She got very upset and said my parents and I were spreading fake news and basically we are part of the problem. Then called him and screamed that he should break off the engagement because ‚ÄúI lied about being sick‚Äù I survived a tumor several years ago that lead to many surgeries which my partner was there for so I would have had to really go to a lot of lengths to make that up.    We agreed we would stop speaking to his mother and focus on our relationship which was good for a few months.

Now I made it very clear I think she is out of her mind but Its his mom and I am not going to stop him from having a relationship so they began talking again. 
A big part of my doesn‚Äôt want her at the wedding or in our lives at all. But it sounds like alienating someone who is part of this stuff might not be the best idea? What do you all think?

657,&lt;---former conspiracy theorist junkie and I hate Q My mom loves him so we dont talk about it,"My mom Loves trump I think because she likes insulting assholes who dont care what damage they cause to get what they want. she used to watch apprentice and didnt believe in any conspiracy theories untill around 2016, I wouldnt know exactly because I was usually in my room trying to find the truth in books, religions. history, and I would usually be the one to present an odd view or theory no one else wouldve considered cause they are not alone with nothing to do, and they would laugh at me so I felt kind of alone watched alot or scifi, I loved stargate. But when I heard what she was believing IT DROVE ME NUTS  ""Pizzagate, Hillarys a hologram, Trump Is Jesus Christ"" I had come across most of these theorys (the Christ one I had to research...in doing so I found a time travel one I dare not show her because shes already wasting time watching other shit)  I have got into heated arguments with her because I researched trumps history and never liked him. I would argue to her for example: He started A charity the trump fundation that he never gave a cent to and it was shut down for something illegal, but you think hes going to help you She would reply """"and you Believe that???"" and laugh we would argue to the point she would get so mad she would run away rubbing her ears and I screamed and punch a hole in the wall. And  I thought since I used to believe some of the stuff she was saying I could get threw to her. that night we kind of hit a stalemate and we both kind of just dont talk about it anymore, because we know its impossible for one of us to win.  I know she still belives what she does but I dont care. I tried my best and it only seemed to make it worse. im content with this as long as she doesnt repeat the same theory over and over everyday like its going to change my idea.

659,Almost Qanon; a discussion on Alternative media brainwashing,"My grandfather seems to have a penchant for supporting leaders with fascistic tendencies, such as his support for both Duterte and Trump in 2016. However, he has since then dropped his support for Duterte, not because he prefers to kill drug abusers instead of, I don't know, offering them rehab, but because he has ""allied himself with communist China."" I believe that not everyone is perfect, but what my grandpa (and the rest of my family) seems to lack in their otherwise unassuming and polite personalities, they make up for in espousing the most outdated and harmful views bordering on conspiracy, hence the ""almost Qanon"" title. I have watched my family change from typical immigrants who get their news from a healthy mix of different news sources to exclusively watching OANN, reading Epoch Times, and watching god knows what on Youtube.

Youtube is a godforsaken website. It has an algorithm notorious for trapping people in ideological echochambers. The emergence of alternative news media seems like a good thing on paper, but these internet news channels aren't obligated to the same amount of fact checking as those on the mainstream media. If you already hold the same ideas as the person spreading the news, there is a good chance that you won't question what they are telling you because you have a confirmation bias. Most of these alternative media sources are free to spread conspiracy theories to an unquestioning audience. The crazier the conspiracy, the more attention it gets.

 The algorithm is also easy to manipulate- people with enough money, who otherwise would never be aired on TV because of the conspiracies that they push, can pay for ads on youtube and mass produce videos at a faster rate. The result of this is channels such as China Uncensored and PragerU, which are gateways to alt-right conspiracy channels such as Stefan Molyneux that push the Jewish Question. I am not white, so I don't need to worry about my family becoming Nazis, but some are at greater risk. 

What's even worse is that when you tell them about this, *they'll accuse you of watching the fake news when they are being fed disinformation day in and day out.* 

These are the consequences of ""doing your own research"". There are traps and pitfalls every step of the way, and these places are just as untrustworthy as ""mainstream media."" There is a point to be made about the media controlling the narrative, but if you really want to know the truth you have to stop relying on these alternative media figures and be open to people challenging things that you have believed your whole life, especially if you are religious, in the case of my grandfather. 

There is also a case to be made about religion. If you were raised to place blind faith in supernatural stories that are hard to prove the happened in real life, there is a great chance you are prone to believing in conspiracies. However, religion is not the great evil itself, it is a tool, like money, those can use to influence others. 

I am worried about my family. Whenever they turn the TV on I can hear the hate that these people preach against the boogeyman ""Left"" and ""Antifa"". What will they think of me? How will they react if I bring a black friend home, or a Mexican friend, knowing that they are regularly racist to these people at home? They have become more bigoted, whether they know it consciously or unconsciously because of these QAnon adjacent theories. I just overhead my uncle talking about the deep state. I had more faith in him, hoping he was apolitical, but no. He is just like everybody else in my family: racist, classist, sexist, and judgmental towards people who live different lifestyles.

660,What happens when Trump is aliven't?,"I mean, the man is no spring chicken and even being rich and with access to top doctors, his diet is garbage and he never exercises. So I doubt he'll live another 20 years. Regardless of how long he makes it, what happens after? From my experience with my QParent, the entire thing hinges on Trump. The reason that so many treat him like a Christ figure is because to them he really is a savior.

My wife is a sociologist who specializes in cults, so I'm not unfamiliar with cults and how they behave after a leader dies, but Q is different. For one, Trump isn't leading Q directly; these are all aspersions they have put on him. I think we can all agree he ran for President for his own ego, nothing more. The QAnons latched on to him because they want to believe that the world is evil and run by Democrat baby-eaters.

So what do they do? The man could keel over tomorrow, and to me its terrifying to think of what sort of unhinged mayhem will come. Undoubtedly they will think he was killed. Do they turn to violence? Come to their senses? Latch onto a new, younger person like a Lauren Boebert?",QAnonCasualties
661,Some suggestions?,"I read an article where a woman was going to have her mother committed and then she read up on this Q Anon and decided she wasn‚Äôt insane and that it‚Äôs Q Anon.

How they respond (withdrawal symptoms?) might give you more answers to the complexities of the illness. Can they be videotaped and shown the video once they get back home?

IMHO, people fall into fantasy when something in reality is too untenable for them. Figure out what that is. 

And as they say in al-Anon people change when it becomes too uncomfortable not to. What would provide them with maximum discomfort? 

Who is in ultimate charge of their devices? Change the WIFI password to one they aren‚Äôt given, suspend their cell phone, parental block Fox News, OAN and Newsmax. Take cash and cards so they can‚Äôt sneak out and purchase a burner phone. All this can be done and they will likely go frantic ... withstand! And remember to take radios out of the house.

662,I Guess it is Goodbye...,"I suppose it shouldn't have been a horrifying shock that my mother would have fallen into such ""Q"" ridiculousness, eventually.

I first became aware that something was somewhat off as a child ‚Äî when my mother was dragging her then five children to see 'healing revivals' attended by thousands, 'Christian' concerts, where people swayed in trancelike fixation, both hands towards heaven, speaking gibberish, or even at times ‚Äî contorting on the ground like a fish out of water desperate for life.

It concerned me that people were not self-conscious, or even feeling a little absurd behaving that way in public, or worse, in private ‚Äî seemingly for the satisfaction-or-amusements of other like-minded individuals ‚Äî or the people who supposed to lead them.

Growing older, it got more ludicrous and more extreme ‚Äî although now inside of these buildings, Pat Robertson, Billy Graham, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, and others. They were making wild claims, insisting that Jesus was returning imminently ‚Äî and that we were in the 'end times.' They made tens of millions from exploiting the fears and devotion of these people.

Ridiculous numbers of people were going broke. Her three oldest (12, 14, and 15) would ask my father (who wouldn't attend) what would happen if our mother left us there. She constantly threatened to leave us with other 'Charismatic Christian' family counselors to drive the evil and lust for sin out of us.

I was forced into parochial schools. Not Catholic, or Jewish (which is what I am, we are), but evangelical, charismatic Christian institutions ‚Äî who believed in corporal punishment, humiliation, and wild racism. They groomed the young males into Christian misogyny with a drumbeat of 'women stand behind their husbands, and support them, not beside them.' You would hear girls (prepubescent) talking about how they will be a Proverbs 31 woman. Those women are the modern ""Q"" movement; they were children during this movement.

Luckily, I escaped through academia. State testing and the not yet pervasive homeschooling movement were luckily at odds ‚Äî the state discovered that not only should I, but I could rapidly accelerate my education, graduating from high school just shy of my 15th birthday.

My sisters didn't fare so well ‚Äî because they were, after all, girls. In their way, each one escaped, educated, and became independently successful. They found husbands, and in some cases, left them. They found careers, and each has been thriving.

The above preamble illustrates that these people have existed (those susceptible to these kinds of cults and radicalizing religious groups) within the US, pervasively, since its inception.

In 2017, everything changed. I would describe a person I would define as a religious fanatic and disciplined Christian who became unhinged, cruel, hateful, overtly racist ‚Äî dismissive, xenophobic, and believe it or not ‚Äî a Holocaust denier. My bubbie (mum's mum) was a Holocaust survivor who lived to 102, the only survivor of 12 children from Birkenau concentration camp. My mother denied the genocide of our entire family (my maternal grandmother was the only survivor on that side of the family) by hateful, racist misinformation ‚Äî propagated by 'Fake News' reinforced by irresponsible platforms like Facebook and Fox, and made ever-present by the society unraveling platform of Twitter.

In 11 months, my mother went from a harmlessly gullible grandmother and great-grandmother ‚Äî to a raging racist, misogynistic crazy person, who believed in unhinged, untethered realities that assailed our ethnicity, our faith, and our sanity.

She began abusing my father, accusing him of being a pedophile, a sheep, brainwashed, and most importantly, ""The Deceived."" My father is in his late 70s, has dementia advancing, and cannot live unsupervised. She would withhold food, leave him in the bedroom for days, humiliated him in public, leave him at bus stops for hours why she ran errands ‚Äî and came back to screaming insults and threats to abandon him at a VA home.

I removed my father from the house and placed him in assisted living just a short ride away from the grandchildren.

In 2018, my brother, then in his late 30s, was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer ‚Äî and he deteriorated-and-died within 11 months.

During that time, we confronted many things ‚Äî not the least of which is that my only brother was adopted in the 70s by our family, is mixed race, and came out as gay shortly after graduating college. Of course, when he came out, my mother told all sorts of stories to herself about how he may have those feelings, but never acted on them, and therefore, will most likely receive salvation ‚Äî especially, if she can get him to admit that his lifestyle is disgusting, a choice and that he repents.

After about ten years, she gave up on those designs ‚Äî and wouldn't speak of it, but was never cruel upsetting, or anything other than his mother. That is, until 2018.

Before I placed my brother in hospice, I brought the family together to explain my decision. We were all cornered-and-lectured by my mother, with a crazed look in her eye and an unhinged tone in her voice, that her youngest son was the victim of a pedophile ring (in the 70s) and that she rescued him, and that the brainwashing that he received between the ages of newborn and 3 1/2 years old have been 'triggered' by ""The Awakening"" because the 5G towers surrounding the large city in which they live ‚Äî gave him cancer, and that dying gay, was G-d's retribution on his sinful life, if not for Democrats, Republicans would not permit his lifestyle. He would've both lived and known salvation.

Her five surviving children, 15 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren have not seen her since his funeral. COVID, of course, is a hoax. She refuses to wear a mask ‚Äî and, therefore, cannot be around any of her children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.

Her ""Q"" friends warned her that the masks were a liberal plot to separate her generation from all previous generations so that the cabal ‚Äî will not be challenged when the 144k children per year are ritualistically sacrificed, and then ‚Äî I don't know, their blood is collected for some laughable word, that sounds as though Jim Henson wrote it into the plot of a Muppet movie.

The above is not an uneducated woman. She is not an isolated woman. This woman is not a poorly traveled, poorly read, or a poorly educated human being. This is an individual who speaks three languages, including English; got both a Bachelors and Masters of fine arts in performance on three instruments. An artist, writer, curious person with a quirky, often misguided allegiance towards religious dogma and devotion to a creator that she can neither see nor hear (audibly.)

I fear, if we dismiss, ignore, or ridicule these people more deeply ‚Äî we'll turn a belief and cause into a religion, lifestyle, and dogma that will be unshakable. Our country is not without precedent. Even Ronald Reagan was taken in by a cultlike conspiratorial group early in his career. People cared enough about him ‚Äî to sternly pull him away and make him realize that the fringes he was toying with would ultimately have him dismissed, debunked, and left off the playing field. Luckily, his ambition for power far exceeded his need for sycophantish praise from people on the margins of society.

I needed to share this ‚Äî I'm not sure where it'll go, I don't know what to do, and I don't believe I will ever have a meaningful relationship with my mother again.

I suppose I'm either looking for support-and-permission to abandon the woman who gave me life so that I might save my own ‚Äî or hope that there is a way to de-radicalize, deprogram, and get back the eccentric, quirky, brilliant woman ‚Äî who was odd, but not insane.",QAnonCasualties

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,

We  are creative writers working on an electronic storytelling project  relevant to this sub. Our goal is not just to record the stories of  broken relationships but also to serve as a catalyst and platform for  mending those relationships.

Would  you like to try a gentle, non-confrontational way to reach your family  member or friend lost to Q? We are working on an electronic literature  piece to tell up to 20 stories about relationships that broke, due in  part to trusting in different information sources and thus developing  diverging political beliefs.

You  could invite your lost-to-Q loved one  to contribute, or you can  contribute your own story and send that to your loved one. This could be  a way to reach out and mend relationships.

Take our survey at  [https://infocue.surveysparrow.com/s/InfoCUE-Information-Creating-Understanding-and-Empathy/tt-c562ef](https://infocue.surveysparrow.com/s/InfoCUE-Information-Creating-Understanding-and-Empathy/tt-c562ef).  You can answer the questions yourself without your friend or family  member, or you can invite your friend or family member to answer them  jointly with you.  We will send your answers back to you in a form you  can share if you wish.  We will use the responses in a forthcoming  electronic literature piece, which will provide links within each story  to show how people have grown apart in this divisive era of battling  information sources. While some or all of your story may be used, we  will not use your name or any identifying information.

667,Friend of 15 Years - Rant/Vent,"Thinking about the conversation my friend and I had in the summer of 2020 gives me a really nasty feeling. Reading a lot of these stories posted, that nasty feeling inside is enhanced because I notice striking similarities. The symptoms of someone falling down the Q-hole sometimes seem identical - the reactions, the hate, etc. 

She was my first friend when I moved in 6th grade (I‚Äôm 27 now, for reference). My parents were so happy I found a friend who 1) I liked 2) had been surrounded by ‚Äúlike‚Äù morals. 

Some background - we had just moved from a very religious, non-diverse (very white), low-income area. These points alone are not the issues, it was the parent‚Äôs and rhetoric of our neighbor‚Äôs that my parents were uncomfortable with. Friend‚Äôs parents would sneak bibles in my backpack, friends would make me cry in 2nd grade because my parents didn‚Äôt take us to church and I was going to hell, my parents worried about my sister and I at our friends‚Äô for dinner because they knew we‚Äôd have to awkwardly pray. 

She was my first friend in my new town, her parents were pro-choice, separation of church and state, etc. What was great was finding people who didn‚Äôt allow their religious beliefs to blanket the country‚Äôs politics, even more so, people who had an aligned religious view. We felt like yay! We found our people. 

Even in my new town, our liberal views were not the norm, but we were surrounded by a different type of conservative view than in our previous hometown, or at least less ‚Äúin your face‚Äù. 

My friend and I remained best friends throughout middle school, thru high school, and even tho different colleges we were close throughout those years as well. Post-grad we had our first official rift (2019 ish). It‚Äôs over things non-Q related so I won‚Äôt go into that - just different phases of our lives got in the way of being able to relate to each other. 

We keep afloat because by this time she is a new mom, and I want to be there for her and her new family. Just because I couldn‚Äôt relate didn‚Äôt mean I couldn‚Äôt be the cool aunt, help out from time to time, and just all around be there as a sense of normalcy outside of new parenthood etc. 

COVID hits and she‚Äôs hating on our state‚Äôs governor (who gets hated on by Trump and Trumper‚Äôs constantly). This was surprising to me, I truly didn‚Äôt expect her reaction to the governor‚Äôs shut down to be so short sighted? I expected some logical backboard in her frustration. 

BLM protests and presentations begin, maybe the first ‚Äúmajor round‚Äù in summer 2020. A protest in a city across the state had minimal destruction done, she FREAKS out, calls them riots, is OUTRAGED at all the property damage....? But she called them riots. I challenged that, only to get immediate snark from her and another friend in our group chat. 

Then the suicide of that Isaac person happened, I had seen it on Twitter, not knowing at the time it had bases in Q conspiracy, I didn‚Äôt know what Q was at the time, I took note of the Twitter thread, thinking dang that‚Äôs wild &amp; probably untrue, but I might want to go back and read it later. 

Without having the chance to, she brings it up. I respond that I saw that, what was it? She sends me a 45 minute long video about Hillary Clinton trafficking kids from Haiti. Goes on about Monster‚Äôs Inc. being true only it‚Äôs The Elite taking screams from children to create adreochrome. I ask her, what about everything with Epstein and Trump, those rape accusations? She goes, I don‚Äôt know, I just know I Hate Hillary Clinton, and she‚Äôs an AWFUL human being who should burn in hell. Like so ANGRY. I was nervous texting about it, because everything I questioned she had a rebuttal for but it was often intimidating and aggressive. Like if I didn‚Äôt believe it... I‚Äôm completely out of my mind..?!

I asked her if she really thought this was true, it was sounding ‚Äúpizza-gatey‚Äù and ‚Äúbut the emails‚Äù. She said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the thing - when I first saw pizzagate I thought it was bullshit, I believe it now‚Äù. She starts on other topics about how the BLM protests are being funded by democrats as a hoax. This was all really fucking sad. I haven‚Äôt brought up anything to her since, and neither has she. We‚Äôve seen each other and talked just fine, but in the back of my mind I just do not like her anymore. I‚Äôm not sure if she is still believing everything, or where she stands with it. I don‚Äôt even want to touch the conversation with a ten foot pole. I would like to think after all the debunking she no longer invests in the conspiracy, but I don‚Äôt know. She doesn‚Äôt post, she just reads and absorbs. 

Her calling the BLM protests ‚Äúriots‚Äù was enough for me to be super upset, but everything else on top of that it‚Äôs like, who is this person? 

Thanks for letting me vent, feel free to share your story in the comments.

679,feeling guilty for not liking my Q parent ( rant ),"So, my mum is really into conspiracy theories and it has gradually escalated. Now she seems to be into some QAnon things, not believing all of it but it still concerns me. She's more open about her opinions and beliefs now, which is unfortunate. My dad isn't very into them, he watches them when she does at times, and i'm sure he isn't as extreme in his opinions.

She is a good mother in most aspects. She does a lot for me, is usually kind and caring. However, I just.. don't like her still ? I really try to, I think about how caring she is and how good she can be. I just can't get past the blatant racism, homophobia, transphobia and general disregard for others ( anti-vax, anti-masks etc. ). It hurts, because underneath it, I think she is kind and wouldn't hurt anyone. Yet clearly she can hurt people, so much. It hurts to know she can disregard science, our health and safety, as well as respect for others.

I got into an argument with her as she overheard me getting to a breaking point over these things. I was in pain that day regardless and I felt ill, and I just couldn't take it. I ranted to my brother about how I feel that's all she does all day - watch things that affirm these beliefs. She was really angry, calling me ungrateful and not letting me even apologise for what I said no matter how hard I tried to. She thinks she knows what I ""really"" think of her now. 

I don't think that badly of her, but I couldn't even express that It bothered me as I was shut down. Apparently I can't tell her what to believe or watch. Which is right of her to say, I can't do that. Yet it hurts to see my mother who i saw as kind and loving, turn into someone who could just easily say something racist, or praise a president who caused so much hurt and despair. I mean, she definetly hasn't been the nicest all the time, but I try not to think of that mistreatment, as I don't want to seem ungrateful.

The worst thing is i'm just full of guilt, I feel sick. I said some rude things I didn't mean. I have bad anxiety to begin with and I feel like i'm falling apart. She kept saying how she dislikes the way I act most of the times and the things I like, which also hurt a lot. She has always been enthusiastic about the things I enjoy previously.

I don't know if i'm a bad person for disliking her, or kind of losing it earlier. Due to her care she gives me I feel that I can't dislike her. I'm made to feel ungrateful if I critizise her for anything. 

I don't know if this guilt is common or not ? Please let me know if you have experienced something similar. I'm sorry for the long rant, i'm really not doing well with this.

There have been anti Semitic theories of deep state-style cabals for centuries. The fake document known as The Protocols of The Elders of Zion was like this, claiming that Jews were part of a cabal to control the government and the world.

But perhaps the most startling is the nearly word for word similarity to the Pizzagate insanity. For centuries, there has been anti Semitic conspiracies in some parts of the world that Jews kidnap non-Jewish children and eat them in order to perform rituals and stay young. Sometimes these theories mention molestation. Of course, most sane people can hear this and realize how anti Semitic and ridiculous it is, but the Pizzagate theory is almost word for word the same and all these people fall for it. Not to mention it just replaces the word ‚ÄúJews‚Äù with synonyms like ‚ÄúHollywood Elites‚Äù or ‚Äúrich globalists like George Soros‚Äù.

I knew that what she was immersing herself in was very right wing, pro-Trump, pro-Patriot, but I never could have imagined that she would espouse QAnon. On the way to her COVID vaccination appointment (which I forced her into), she launched into a disturbing story. She began enthusiastically telling me how JFK Jr. has been alive all this time  (and his wife and sister-in-law) and he will be coming out in public in the next two weeks. I could not believe what I was hearing. I calmly asked her to explain further. She said that in the late 90‚Äôs the Clintons were worried that JFK Jr posed a threat to Hilary‚Äôs political chances in the Senate so they plotted to take Jr. out by putting a bomb in his plane. But...intelligence found out about the plot and instead of Jr, his wife and sister-in-law getting on the plane, they were put into hiding. Meanwhile, another pilot flew Jr‚Äôs plane that fateful day and ejected himself just before it blew up. This was all top secret. Jr, his wife, and sister-in-law have been kept in protective hiding for all of these years‚Äîexcept for the occasional event that Jr would go to in disguise (like Trump‚Äôs Inauguration).  When Jr comes out to the public in two weeks, he plans to expose the Clintons and gave them arrested for their plot to kill him. Then he will join forces with his ‚Äúgood friend‚Äù Donald Trump and he‚Äôll him expose all the members of the Deep State who are pedophiles and sacrifice babies for their blood. I am beyond dumbfounded. Just speechless.  When I tried to talk with Mom and bring her back to reality, she just kept shaking her head and saying that I just don‚Äôt know.

694,Upside down...,"I don‚Äôt know where to being...because I don‚Äôt know where IT began..except with the sharing here I have begun to see there were Red flags..lots of them.  I am a Boomer..75 years old.  My son..who is in his mid 50‚Äôs is smart..hard working..compassionate..funny..easy-going..generous person..he has been taken over by gradual Trump-ism morphed into Q-ism.  He is now angry and passionate about a lot.    
I first tried to challenge his thinking/beliefs..gently (mostly) but sometimes not so gently (which I now regret).  Here‚Äôs what I receive from him in text/conversations:  ‚ÄúThe Media‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe Left‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe Democrats‚Äù (like all these millions of people are identical) ‚ÄúThe Liberals‚Äù ‚ÄúAntifa‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Deep State‚Äù...endless conspiracies to hurt Trumap (no matter what he has said or done...has Never criticized him) ‚ÄúCOVID was a hoax to damage Trump‚Äù by the ‚ÄúDemocrats or the Chinese‚Äù.  He said before the election ‚Äúthere won‚Äôt be any talk of COVID after Nov. 4th)‚Äù...‚Äùstolen election..there were hidden boxes of ballots under tables‚Äù (proven untrue).

Locally here...his anger (which surprises me) is directed to our nearest Big city because they are uber liberal (which this is true).  Our nearby/local buildings or schools are being re-named because of charges of racism.  This is a school he attended so it‚Äôs is personal to him as a ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù issue.Also the Civil War statues being torn down.

He is now talking of moving to a very conservative very Red State because he feels understood.

I am grieving because he has already distanced himself for me.  We used to talk almost every day..that is gone.  I miss that connection.

695,Not as extreme... yet.,"For my (boomer) folks, since they don‚Äôt have social media, the spiral has been slower than for other people. But they saturate themselves in Fox News and Breitbart and are surrounded by like-minded uber-conservatives. I know they are at extremely high risk because they have used phrases like ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt trust research, it‚Äôs all bought and paid for.‚Äù They argue with me about things I am a literal expert in, things on which I have built my career. If I bring up hard fact they use that favorite phrase- you can‚Äôt trust research, can‚Äôt trust evidence.

I live in fear of the day they really start going full Q. I hear echoes of it. Mercifully they are getting the vaccine and they do their best to follow covid protocols- masking and all- but their very worldview has become so embittered and unempathetic that I wonder where the people who raised me went and if they can still come back.

My folks aren‚Äôt as far into the cult as other people‚Äôs, I know. At least not that they have voiced, but the past couple years our conversations have been shallow. I see them every week and we talk about the weather, or their chickens, or my garden. That‚Äôs about it.",QAnonCasualties
696,"A little history, explanation, and my 2 Q friends.","A little history, explanation, and my ex-Q friend.

So I have two friends who fell into the Q reality (Just ‚Äòq-land‚Äù from now on). One is still in it; the other is back into reality, our real, shared normal reality.

BTW- for those interested, The Qanon/embrace of the tRump movement can be traced from 4chan, back through ‚Äúsomething awful‚Äô a website of the 2000‚Äôs then back to Japan‚Äôs economic crash of the 90‚Äôs. (ie QAnon-Anon podcast ep 128).¬†¬†

First, we are not, or rather were not, in an age of unique increased conspiracy thinkers (as of 2014 anyway) While there have been spikes, the level of conspiracy theorists in the country usually returns to a baseline, or has since WWII. (See Suspicious MInds: Why We Believe Conspiracy Theories by Rob Brotherton. So why the spike of Q? It‚Äôs a perfect storm, so to speak:

-The growth of the internet and social media. Information sources have grown almost exponentially since the internet started. The world is more complex. This makes people afraid, less certain of their world. It is harder to be sure of things, hence harder to make sense of the world with so many competing sources od explanatrion, the ground is shaky so to speak. People seek comfort through explanations, and for some, the simpler the better.¬†¬†

-The effect of ‚ÄúChan‚Äù memes, etc:¬† 4Chan, etc. members‚Äô point of being is to ridicule popular culture by blowing it up from within, so to speak. Undermine it by popularizing things that undercut baselines and reality. Promoting tRump was one such act. 4Channers KNEW tRump‚Äôs horrible financial history, his faults, that he‚Äôd most likely be a horrible leader, but they promoted him because 1)it was a bad joke to play on everyone else (who had jobs, families, etc) and 2) he was, in a way, like them; willing to break norms.¬†

-Covid/time: A component of growth in q-land adherents has to do with so many people having had extra time on their hands to browse YouTube and other echo chambers via lockdowns, layoffs, closed restaurants, movies, etc.¬†

-Covid/financial: Most people who stormed the capital had some kind of recent financial setback/difficulty. This is, of course, not true of many q-landers, just some of the most extreme, but the base that grew it into a critical level needed for respectability, a tipping point that gave it some validity to where others were drawn into it, were by and large, under/unemployed 4channers and other ‚Äúchanners‚Äù.¬† People in these communities needed to spend vast amounts of time participating to be accepted hence they were people with no, or low paying, jobs, people with loads of extra time with no spouses or families or interests except 4chan, etc, who demanded their time.¬† Busy people with active jobs and interests and families were just non-existent on early 4-chan communities that started to promote tRump as a joke to foist upon everyone else.

-The grifters:¬† Facebook/YouTube/etc. ; Once it had grown large enough, the grifters moved in.¬† Youtube and Facebook, etc. allowed ‚Äòinfluencers‚Äô to monetize‚Äô q-land with their videos and Facebook groups seeking donations.¬†

¬†-There is no one Q doctrine. It is flexible; people can apply whatever parts they want to their specific belief system, and its holes. So many voices, so many things to pick and choose from.

¬†-It starts with little things that have a grain of truth. I.e. Alex Jones claims scientists are making human/animal hybrids. If you look it up, you see he is technically correct in a very, very small way, but 1) they are not growing chimeras and 2) that is the kind of thing (gene splicing, etc.) that science DOES, they push boundaries. Yet some don‚Äôt make that distinction, and say ‚Äúhey, Alex is kinda right, what else does he have to say?‚Äù¬† Or: Child trafficking goes from generic child sexual abuse to adrenochrome seeking¬† baby-killers in a public pizza parlor by national figures over the course of 20 videos watched.

-So, there is no typical Q-lander, although there are a few traits that seem to make people more susceptible (ie younger males who feel disenfranchised, no power), conservatives (who show higher fear response in brain scans when faced with unknown/uncertain change, hence high gun ownership, fear of immigrants), people previously attracted to other ‚Äòisms‚Äô (even liberal new-age-isms, ie people who might bite at the child trafficking part of q only to start believing the adrenochrome storyline), people who have a predilection for authoritarianism (more toward trump supporting parts of Qanon).¬† See Suspicious Minds, Brotherton, CH1 for a more specifics about people who may be predisposed to conspiracy theories.¬† A number of theories abound, I doubt there is one set of driving traits.

Mix those things in (and I‚Äôm sure I missed a bunch) with the following: confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance, and you have people who you CANNOT logically talk away from q-land.

Confirmation bias is when we are told/shown we are wrong but we double down, and start cherry-picking only information that confirms our ideas, and rejecting other data. This is where the rejection of ‚Äòlame stream media‚Äô and ‚Äòyou‚Äôve been brainwashed‚Äô and ‚Äúsheeple‚Äù come in. The harder one pushes, the harder the believer digs in and reaffirms their own position.

It‚Äôs like a drug: as with most drugs the high/other feelings of validation/security/etc start to seem insufficient, so they spend more time on the internet, and start believing more &amp; more outlandish things to both give them the ‚Äòconspiracy high‚Äô and fight off the effects of cognitive dissonance.

¬†Cognitive Dissonance:¬† (Read ‚ÄúA Theory of Cognitive Dissonance‚Äù, by Leon Festinger. This is the original thesis for C.D.)¬† At some level, people KNOW that what they believe does not jive with reality, or at least they are presented with evidence of it.¬† The predictions fail, counter evidence is presented, etc., so people have to do SOMETHING with that internal conflict, deal with it somehow. Anger at family members, not only for challenging their belief system, but, eventually, for not joining in. Another example is when q predictions fail they often deal with the cognitive dissonance with ‚ÄúWell, it was worth it because we made great friends, we‚Äôre still a special group‚Äù (said one popular QAnon YouTube grifter to his adherents when the military takeover failed at the inauguration, and he decided to move on to other things, leaving his flock stranded) and they move on to other things to seek the same camaraderie.

Per my friend who was a q-lander, attempts to logically dispel their beliefs were useless. Absolutely pointless, in fact, they can be harmful as they drive the other person further away. They still chuckle when I ask why I couldn‚Äôt talk them out of it. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it, NOTHING you could have said would change my mind, ESPECIALLY if I thought you were on the other side politically. Nothing.¬† He said it was not like telling a drug user that drugs were bad, it was more like telling a drug user that drugs don‚Äôt make you feel good. (The analogy is off, I know, except for the pointlessness &amp; futility it expresses). They came to the realization themselves. It is as simple as that.

There are organizations that deal with teenagers, fairly successfully.¬† However you cannot take an adult‚Äôs internet away against their will, make them attend counseling, and detox them from Qanon without their permission.

Finally, maybe, hopefully, for whatever reason(s); social isolation, job loss, loss of friends, family, the failure of one too many predictions, or the inability to overcome the ever growing cognitive dissonance and finally see things as they actually are, your friend/family member/spouse/etc might want to come back to reality. My friend experienced EXTREME feelings of shame, guilt, self-loathing and, most importantly, feelings that they didn‚Äôt think they would be accepted or welcomed back by family and friends. They were extremely surprised when the reaction was not hate and ridicule, but ‚Äúwelcome back, we missed you‚Äù.¬†

The other friends is, unfortunately, long gone into Q. The door is open, they know that, but no Q allowed.",QAnonCasualties
697,It‚Äôs really important you all vote.,"I read the sub every day. I am so heartbroken for all of you out there suffering from broken marriages, broken parents, broken friendships because of the Q cult. I think like many observers, I thought Q fever might break after January 20‚Äìat least to some extent. 

Obviously it hasn‚Äôt.

So I want to stress something to all of you: it is very, very, very important that you vote for organizations or candidates who give no quarter to Q. Yes, I know implicitly this means I‚Äôm saying ‚ÄúVote Democrat.‚Äù 

Let me say I‚Äôm not a registered Democrat and have supported both Democrats and Republicans. 

Right now, Republicans don‚Äôt know what to do with Q. At the state level, they are embracing it; at the federal level, some are enamored with it while others are disgusted. Conservative *political operators* are lining up behind it, however. You see Q implications all over content from conservative social media influencers, bloggers, podcasts, etc. Even Tim Tebow is now obsessed with saving children from human trafficking (a noble cause but largely ignorant that most victims of human trafficking are adult women, and often prosecuted for sex crimes. Sorry Tim, it‚Äôs Qbait).

Cults like these aren‚Äôt really just cults. They are chaos operations, meant to disrupt the dynamic of elections and divide us so bad actors can seize power in the vacuum. If principled Republicans form a third party, it is more likely conservative/moderate Democrats will be the voters drawn to it than Republicans, who typically vote party lines more rigidly and are rejecting facts at an astonishing rate. 

Families of those who suffered from Q craziness could make the difference here. Before all this, some (not all) of you voted with your parents, your husbands and wives, your siblings and friends. It‚Äôs not enough to break ties‚Äîwe must prevent this group from taking any form of power or control over the actual levers of our government. 

If we do not, we all know they will create a self-fulfilling prophesy. They will round up everyone they are already convinced is guilty. They will engage in violence to ‚Äúprevent violence.‚Äù They will gaslight us all into living in their reality. It‚Äôs so essential we all do our part to block this group or any that supports or implicitly accepts its thinking from power. 

We can see the writing on the wall. Republicans are probably not going to divide; Q will remain a faction to be dealt with. The best way to do that is keep them on the fringe where they belong.",QAnonCasualties
698,Found the right place to vent,"Hello to anyone who reads this, I am new to this subreddit.



A little bit of context: there are only three in my household: my parents and I (19yo Male).


The casualty is my Mother.


I have been Right-leaning my whole life. I'm a Christian and my parents have been cops: my Mom was the first Female Chief of the neighboring town, and my Father (just retired, bless him) was the Chief of my hometown for 40 years. So based on my upbringing, it isn't surprising to see why I was Right-leaning. I still have some Right-leaning beliefs, but that's not what is important. What is important is the stuff that has divided our nation.


My support for Trump had been eroding for a while, even preceding recent events.


The first point of contention with my Mom was the election. Based on simple math: (Number of registered voters in America √ó percentage of Democrats + percentage of Left Leaning Independents √ó voter turnout rate) gives you almost exactly how many votes Biden got.
However, my Mom was fully with Trump. That Trump won by a landslide and that there was actually MASSIVE fraud. Now, fraud is not impossible, but I do not believe there would have been enough to sway the result of the election.

So I had become disenchanted with Trump and really only kept a glimmer of faith in him because the Republican Party still supported our Law Enforcement.


Now for the next couple of months, the theories and stuff that my Mom was viewing was getting crazier and crazier. She eventually got hooked to this theory that there was going to be a huge reckoning on Inauguration Day.


I obviously took objection to this ludicrous theory. However, she slammed me with something that pissed me off so bad at could barely even finish my argument, which is uncharacteristic of me as people note I have good control over my emotions. She said ""You're becoming Liberal as fuck and it's scaring me!""
The fact she threw that at me, just because I was trying to get her back on track... I didn't know what to say and I still don't, and that was over a month ago.


Then the final glimmers of hope I had were crushed with the siege on the Capitol. Seeing a bunch of Trump supporters clashing with those Police Officers at the barricade. Calling those poor officers Traitors for doing their job. This was an enormous backstab, and days later I changed my Political Party Affiliation to Independent/None.


""But it was actually Antifa!"" She says. The sad part is that I don't know if she truly believes that or couldn't accept reality. She did condemn the attack itself on the Capitol, but I don't know who she thinks the perpetrators were.


Then comes Inauguration Day, and lo and behold, the Reckoning was bupkis. She called off work to see what was going to happen, and she would up crying all day while watching the TV. Now I don't know if the root of these tears is sheer panic and that ""America is going to end"" or if she realized that I was right and she was lied to.


She's been quieter about her beliefs since. Now nobody in my household is a big fan of Biden or Harris, but I can say with certainty that I am just not a fan of either side right now. The saddest thing of all is that I have to say ""sides"" as people forget that we are all AMERICANS and that we all live under the same stars and stripes.


I am not sure if she is still stuck in QAnon ideals or not. Only time will tell. If you read this whole thing, thank you, God Bless You, and God Bless America.",QAnonCasualties
699,Some advice that might help,"Here‚Äôs some advice for anyone to use if they want it. A tactic I use to try to make the people around me realize how ridiculous they sound when talking about Q in hopes that they come to their senses is a pretty simple one: basic follow up questions.

700,No q anon in Colombia except for a close friend. Now his family is suffering.,"Background: late 90s, back in architecture school i Made good Friends with a funny friend. Good student, good at sports , good with the ladies.  He would drink a bit too much but he kept it under control.

Then in 2000 his dad went bankrupt , he had to quit school and he flew to Miami , where he could work and study. It was hard ,he went from a rich kid to working class inmigrant.  Yet , he managed to become a successful architect in florida.   He worked at successful firms but he realized he had to quit alcohol. He had a baby on the way, We were all happy.    Then he ""woke"". His kid was supose to bring joy , yet he decided that work was slavery , he dropped out of his successful career.  He would fight with his wife all the time about vaccines and the cancer treatment of a relative of hers.   She put up with him as a drunk for 8 years , but as a ""woke"" morally superior being ,she could only stand him 3 months.  A judge blocked him from seeing his daughter. He told us what he was about to Say in court and we read in horror. His lawyer ditched him.
 
He ended up living in a van , with money he Made by selling ""woke"" courses he created online and with money his sister would send him. ( She is a very successful advertising executive in M√©xico).

Enter q anon.  His watsap messages got Even worse.  Our university WhatsApp group was flooded every day by his pro Trump rants.  ( Brown skinned , colombian , yet...Trump supporter).  Since most of us tryed to talk some sense into him he cut contact with us.

His sister stopped sending him money , so he came back to Colombia to his parents house.  A beautiful country house he had built when he was sane.  His rants got louder and crazier.   His dad , a former alcoholic who had been sobber for decades , got back to the bottle.  His mother just begun with Alzheimer's. Every once in a while  she remembers her bright son got sucked into this cult and she cries painfully.    

His sister , took advantage of the chance of working from Home and moved back to the country house too.  Yet ,she is going insane.  She gets to see his brother in his room all day with his conspiracy theories , her father drinking himself to sleep and her Mom having the same sad thoughts every day for the first time.  She knows she might have to quit her career to take care of the rest.   

The good news , q anon has been comoletely rejected here.  Yes , a few antivaxers , soros and Gates gatera, but  as of now , most people tells them to shut up.

701,Another outburst,"I‚Äôve posted before about my wife who holds a shifting slate of Q/ Trumpy beliefs, developed over the past year or so. We‚Äôve had some pretty heated debates, but with the help of this community, friends, and reading up on strategies to deal with cult/Q followers, I‚Äôve adopted a policy of avoidance, gentle pushback, and refusal to engage, while I admittedly continue to try and wait this thing out. I‚Äôm still on the fence about what to ultimately do; it‚Äôs unbelievably difficult to watch your spouse become a different, angrier person.

Things have been a little calmer for the last couple weeks, but Friday night turned into another shouting match. It‚Äôs the most ridiculous things that set her off and it seems that everything agitates her and has that potential.

We sit down as a family to watch tv, she sees something about Disney, launches right into Gina Carano and cancel culture (anyone else notice these culture war headlines setting people off?). I pushed back gently, tried to say I don‚Äôt agree with firing everybody for what they post, but you need to judge case to case objectively, and Gina Carano posted some really vile stuff that fans reacted to. Well it didn‚Äôt really matter, she was off and running.

Cancel culture, the election was stolen, the Keystone pipeline, China, on and on. I argued back but tried to stay calm as she screamed at me. Began nodding and saying ‚Äúyeah, sure, absolutely,‚Äù at the crazier stuff, which infuriates her.

I lost it when she got to transgenders taking over the country and how they‚Äôre going to go into the locker room and rape our daughter (17, sitting in the room, remaining remarkably, admirably calm). I jumped up and said ‚ÄúYou are out of your mind!‚Äù She continued screaming at me about abortion and how she (my wife) and all the other conservatives are going to be put in jail. So I withdrew again, went back to sarcastically agreeing. She stormed off, went to bed, left the house early Saturday morning and texted me Saturday evening to say she was staying over at her mom‚Äôs. I said great, have a good time.

She came back midday yesterday, Sunday, and tried her best to act like everything was normal. I played along because I just don‚Äôt have the energy and I‚Äôm sticking to the gameplan. We went out to dinner (were supposed to go Saturday for Valentine‚Äôs/my birthday - yeah, she casually trashed my birthday). We had a pleasant enough dinner. She told me that the vaccine is causing tons of miscarriages. I said no, I have not heard that. Moved on.

703,Sometimes people may just be too far gone.,"I've been dealing with a conspiracy theory father for almost my entire life. He's spent 20 years in the air force and is now retired.  We live minutes outside of US Strattcom as he's an independent contractor and genuinely one of the smartest people I know when it comes to linux and windows systems.

He's also been a rampant conspiracy theorist for all of my life and, as much as I've tried for 11 years to get him to put his head out of them, I don't believe I ever will. It's worse because he's also gotten to my sisters and my extended family who, fortunately enough, take him at surface value. 

Something that I don't think I'll ever get rid of and made sure to keep is a bottle of Infowars Brain Force Plus pills he bought in 2017 because, after talking with him and picking his brain on the matter, he's been following most conspiracy theories since he retired in 2004. The first time that I had heard anything about ""The illuminati"" would've been around 2008 when I was playing a game and he pointed out the architecture that ""resembled a masonic temple."" 

I wish I had more to say but even after years of just talking to him about it, the reality of the situation is that he never really was a father to me until we were both adults and I tried my best to reasonably walk him out of the events that have been going on. I had saw that he had ""QAnon drops"" in his youtube search feed and instantly started looking into it back in October to prep for getting him out of it. I've been able to mostly but it doesn't change the fact that most of his views are heavily right leaning, going along with the ""Big Tech is censoring everybody who doesn't give into groupthink because the NWO is trying to cause a civil war in America to get rid of guns forever"" crowd, and I don't think that I'll ever be able to see him as anyone more than a man who fell to dillusions his entire time of knowing me.

I'm 21 and I can think for myself, so I'm pushing myself to get out of the country honestly and probably head out to Canada to be away from my family and to just be away from them all. It sucks because I'm giving up really good job opportunities but just being an independent adult and away from it all sounds like stepping out of a hell I've been in all my life.

708,Is Q More Powerful Than Love?,"I figured it was time for a brief introduction, since I've input to several discussions already.

I am a 55-year-old retired Air Force intelligence analyst, currently working as a civilian in the US Intel community. At age 49, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Four months later, my wife of 18 years left me, taking my daughter with her.   


I hit rock bottom that summer, but friends pulled me out of it, and I started the convoluted game of dating in your fifties. After a couple of years of striking out, I finally met the woman of my dreams. Smart. Strong-willed, but vulnerable. Honest and caring. Well-traveled, with lots of experience. And like me, a ""conservative democrat"" or a ""liberal Republican."" A year later, we were engaged, and I found happiness again.

About a year go, her father died, and due to COVID restrictions, she couldn't go to his funeral, and had no closure. That's when one of her brothers started feeding her QAnon information. Almost overnight she went from that moderate political stance to an extreme far-right stance. She referred to Trump as ""the hand of God"" or the ""second coming"" and, well, you're all familiar with the deep state, Bill-Gates and the vaccines, aliens, angels, JFK Jr is alive, plan-demic and other theories this group shoves down their throats. It started forming a wedge between us, as she often sees me as an enemy now, someone who shoots down everything she finds important. In the last two months, she has twice broken off our engagement, and last night accused me of being with her in an attempt to steal her house from her.   


I should probably just give up and walk away, but I can't. She's been with me through so much, even helping me following hip replacement surgery, allowing me to stay with her for ten days of healing. I love her with all my heart, and I know she's still in there somewhere, under all that hostility and anger.

709,QAnon in Iran??,"I‚Äôm an Iranian-American college student who goes to a pretty liberal school. I have not seen a single Q follower among my friends here. BUT what is insanely absurd is the fact that Qanon and Trump have found a relatively large following in Iran, a country that was hit very hard by Trump imposed sanctions. Just to be clear, a large number of people who are currently hurting badly as a result of Trump‚Äôs sanctions believe the democrats stole the election, and are secretly working with the Mullahs in power in Iran because they are evil or whatever. I grew up and went to high school in Iran but I have had to cut my relations with a number of my high school friends because they started sending me posts about Q and Iranian versions of the same conspiracy theories. I know my story is not as traumatic as many of the stories here about ppl losing their loved ones, but I think it‚Äôs interesting how these crazy conspiracies have made their way into a society so far away from the US.",QAnonCasualties
710,Hoping for hope,"Hi all, first time reddit poster, here. I've been reading this sub for a while. These stories are heartbreaking, but the support in this community is amazing. I wanted to share my experience here, with people who will understand the preemptive grieving I've been going through for the past year.

2019 was the most comfortable I've ever felt with my parents. I've always felt like we just didn't really know how to love eachother. That culminated in 2005 when Fox News convinced my dad I was going to become a terrorist for visiting Turkey. He refused to talk to me for a few months, but eventually apologized and we worked to build back our family. And 2019 finally felt...easy. We enjoyed each others company. We could discuss opposing views and still find common ground. It was great, until March 2020 and the lockdown. 

Dad was consumed with anger. Immediately started spewing conspiracy theories.  Mom soon followed down the rabbit hole. All they did all day was listen to shows like Dan Bongino. Despite me having anxiety attacks, my husband and I still visited every weekend and saw them every holiday. They would start embarassing fights full of BS. We could not talk about anything without it leading to a ""THEY don't want you to be free"" rant. Mom couldn't even listen to classic rock without getting mad about its ""liberal agenda"".

IDK if they ever knew they were parroting Q specifically, but they beleive both that Covid is a Chinese bio-weapon and ""not as bad as the flu"". They believe the election was stolen and that Trump would eventually be inaugurated. Antifa is persecuting poor white supremacists blah blah blah. I don't think they beleive in lizard people, but they definitely buy into ""Dems are ALL EVIL and control the world, but Trump will save us"" rhetoric.

Things have gotten quieter since Jan 6th. Dad has not been hanging out with us when my husband and I visit, but I think it's because he doesn't want to start a fight/make us uncomfortable. They have also been getting outside more. They went sledding yesterday, by themselves, which I think is pretty awesome! I've been waiting for them to decide to cut ties, like last time. But I am hoping that this new avoidance of these topics is a sign they are trying to let go of their anger and move forward. Maybe I'm being too optimistic. I don't know where this is going and I'm exhausted. I'm preparing to lose them, while hoping I won't.  

TLDR: my family fought to build stronger ties after a bunch of BS in the early aughts, finally achieved it, and my parents threw it all away for Dan Bongino.",QAnonCasualties

719,Where did it star,"This syndrome didn't begin as Q.  Both my parents were sucked in through the 'f' entertainment network, first to believe Obama wasn't a US citizen and it spiraled from there.  Dad a devout democratic who never voted republican in his life voted against Obama.  He told me shortly after that we would all have to become Muslim.  They bought survival bundles saying trouble was coming.  When the ex president campaigned and bad mouthed military heroes in so many ways, I thought Dad the proud ex-Marine would see the light but alas it wasn't meant to be.  I thought Mom would come around a little when we all heard ex president saying ""grab them by the p---y"".  All of this information came through 'f' entertainment network. Dad died 4 years ago, Mom's was developing symptoms of Alzheimer's prior to Dad's death and then full blown dementia shortly.  As long as there are outlets for this type of information and our public officials voice support, this'll never end.

721,Putting the Puzzle Together,"I'd like to play Q-detective for a minute, and would love everyone's input. This forum has helped me so much by helping me to contextualize what previously I'd experienced in a horribly personal/isolated way--it had felt like, oh, god, i'm the only person in the world with parents like this, it must mean that insanity runs in my family, and that i'm a bad person for not being able to communicate, etc., etc. 

I think if we can really dig for the explanations here (beyond ""insanity"") we can seriously accelerate our own healing -- and, who knows, society's-at-large :)? 

So, here are a few of the most compelling explanations I've come across in this forum and elsewhere. 

1. Tribal identity -- maybe the most neutral explanation, just says that (some) people will go with their tribe/think with a tribal mind before all else. In my case, my parents were always in the tribe of White Republican Evangelical. The limits of the tribe (the qualities that defined it negatively) were hatred of liberalism, socialism, atheism, market regulation, elite expertise/rationalism/science---all synonymous in their mind with ""Democrats"". 
2. Media bubble -- related to the tribe. In the nineties, my parents were still reading some mainstream publications, but by the early aughts they'd followed the tribe into the rightwing media bubble, sealing themselves into a cultish alternative reality which has metastasized w/ Internet. 
3. Religious / Magical thinking -- Argues that American evangelicals have been primed all their lives to accept things on faith/feeling rather than science; also, they've been trained to equate certain elements of our contemporary society with christianity: namely, capitalism and the free market and businessmen (this is the reason my parents gave for ""believing"" in Trump. ""He's a businessman,"" they'd say -- to them it was equivalent to saying he was good, just, moral, and Christian). 
4. Cognitive dissonance caused by magical thinking -- Argues that it is frustrating/enraging to constantly be in a cognitive dissonance, in which what you are told to believe defies the evidence of your physical senses and experience of the actual world. Alan Watts argued this in the 1960s, raising an alarm about faith-based thinking &amp; society (you can listen to him, for instance, here: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/2SlRSExWYl6n2WbtnallXt?si=evtSmkdPSmKB5hWHh1Xdfw](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2SlRSExWYl6n2WbtnallXt?si=evtSmkdPSmKB5hWHh1Xdfw)). Rage and retreat into a bubble like Q/MAGA are typical responses. 
5. Losing the culture/morality war - The left has won the war over which culture gets to call itself ""moral,"" especially inside mainstream institutions. This drives the right insane, since conservatism has love of institutions and moral uprightness woven into its fiber. Liberals have successfully redefined morality as embracing multiculturalism, racial equality, gender equality, sexual freedom, and respect for the climate, among other things, and have pushed rightwing viewpoints out of the universities, etc. The right has yet to think up a viable response to this, and so has slid into pure opposition and conspiracy. 

I'll stop there -- I haven't mentioned economic explanations (my parents are rich, and i guess probably hate the specter of a future in which they/white people aren't the sole emperors of America), or the ""browning"" of America, or probably a ton of other things....

724,Working with a Q follower.,"Looking for some advice, not sure if this is the right place. 

I work with someone who I am in no doubt is a Q follower. They have recently limited their social media profiles so the crap they post and share is no longer easy to view, although thanks to some internet sleuthing, I have managed to screenshot some of their posts. 

Their role sees them come into contact with the public on a regular basis. Whilst at work, they do adhere to Covid safety guidelines (masks, gloves etc) but in their spare time they post reams of anti vaccine shit, attend anti-lock down rallies and events and do not adhere to social distancing rules. To me, that makes any mask wearing in work null and void if they're mixing with all and sundry the rest of the time. 

Through some further investigation - they also appear to be liking and sharing content that is far right leaning as well as attending events protesting against sexuality education in schools etc. Basically it's a pretty toxic mix of 'Q' supporting, Covid-denial and anti-Semitism.  

I basically want to report them - but don't know A) if I have enough proof and B) if said proof is enough to remove them from their role? 

If anyone could offer some advice, that would be greatly appreciated!",QAnonCasualties
725,I had no idea,"Several years ago, my late 20‚Äôs son started talking about Pizzagate and many conspiracy theories. I am slightly left of center not rabid about politics. At the same time, my sister who lived in FL ( who was always conservative) began getting very active with the NRA, buying and carrying guns, sending me links and books.
I listened to both my son and sister, trying to under what they were talking about and doing my own research into the wild claims. My deduction, this was absurd but I wasn‚Äôt sure how much they truly believed.
Fast forward a year ago. A friend texted me and stated that my son was posting his conspiracies on FB ( I don‚Äôt use FB). I dismissed it as just his way of trolling the ‚Äúlibs‚Äù as he called them. My sister and I had quit speaking as I was furious about some of the stuff she was spouting off about and I hung up on her. I missed and loved her, but she was not the sister that I once knew.
Six months ago, the civil discussions and debates with my son began to get more heated. I tried reason, empathy, finding common ground in the fallacy of his beliefs but to no avail. One morning over coffee I lost it, full out screaming, crying, threatening that I would not listen to it any longer. It was intense and I was ashamed that I had lost it.
My sister was killed on her motorcycle at the beginning of the pandemic (careless motorist). Fortunately I had made peace with her a month before and our conversation had no talk of politics. I am thankful for the last conversation that we had.
My son and I settled it and he no longer brings up any Q conspiracies. A few weeks ago he ‚Äúwiped‚Äù his FB and social media accounts of all of the Q bullshit. Wether he still believes it or not, I do not know, but many of his friends explained to him that it was not beneficial to his reputation or integrity. 
All I can say is that I was so incredibly naive; January 6 proved that we have to be vigilant about protecting and preserving critical thinking in all. In hindsight, I am thankful that I did not really understand how far down the rabbit hole both my sister and son had gone or I would have been frozen in fear and emotion.

I'm not trying to get this 100% correct because I think the point is made accurate or not - transhuman, nano-technology, eugenics driven democide and genocide. We have all been duped by germ theory.  Bill Gates is turning us into walking, talking cellphones, something about a horrific brain parasite and the nano-particles are apparently alive and will fight each other. And that's just the test.

731,My sister was my best friend before this,"My sister and I have always been extremely close however, we have different dads and we grew up entirely different. I grew up in a very diverse household and live in Los Angeles. My sister grew up in upper middle class neighborhoods so has not been exposed to very much outside of typical suburban life. My sister was never a trump supporter or conservative  however shortly after trump was elected she started dating a guy who worked for spacex. They immediately moved in with each other and he decided to move to other spacex locations and my sister went along with him. Shortly after, my sister had a baby with him and they moved to Florida. My sister did not like his trump obsession or his sisters Trump obsession and it made her uncomfortable but she lived with it. Right before covid hit he moved my sister and the kids with him to Florida. This bothered me however they were coming to visit soon so I made plans to spend time with her as much as I could. When the time came, my sister was not able to spend time alone with me or come to my house. We were able to get him to agree to allow us to go to the mall because he was hungover and wanted to take a nap. This was the last time I saw my sister. 

Not long after, he became more obsessed with conspiracy theories and right wing extremism. It wasn‚Äôt long before my sister was sending me pictures of them hanging out at a house with confederate flags. Shortly after that they had a stockpile of guns and were spending all night drinking. My sister started to fall down the hole with him and I couldn‚Äôt even have a conversation with my sister without him in the conversation. She‚Äôs not allowed to visit or even have a job or go to school and she is trapped in the house all the time alone. He would send me link after link after link to bs qanon garbage to try to radicalize me but I am much less impressionable. 

One day my sister face timed me while my boyfriend was over. My boyfriend is from Armenia and has a very heavy accent. They immediately started ridiculing him and asking him why he still speaks English so poorly when he‚Äôs been here since the 90s. Ironically, my boyfriend speaks better English than both of them put together and has a college degree unlike either of them, he just has an accent. He started joking back to them but wasn‚Äôt disrespectful which then led to her boyfriend threatening him the next day to me. This hurt me deeply.

My sister joined a left wing group I was in and everything was fine until her boyfriend then joined (he has to be a part of whatever she‚Äôs doing) and the same day she was posting racist and xenophobic things about Chinese people which obviously got her immediately banned and me embarrassed.

About a week later the George Floyd incident happened and she was heartbroken by the video. She felt what happened to George Floyd was terrible and that night her and her boyfriend got in a big fight about it. Two days later she was calling me repulsive for protesting and ‚Äúsupporting animals‚Äù. She sent me a picture of someone burning a flag and I immediately knew this was all him. My sister could give two shits about a flag. 

I was heartbroken but knew I had to cut them off. I blocked my sister in May and haven‚Äôt talked to her since. In this time she has been completely radicalized in Q conspiracies and their relationship and lifestyle has become so unhealthy that social services is now involved. I make decent income and can afford to buy a bigger place to get her and the kids away from him but I am scared that she‚Äôs gone too far off the deep end.

732,"Anyone had luck in helping their ""Q-Anon sufferer"" ? Q-Anon recovery?","I work in a program that helps people who are experiencing their first episode of psychosis enter and maintain recovery. I also have a sister who is completely immersed in the world of QAnon. If my sister was the only person believing the things she claims to believe in right now, her delusions would mean she would almost certainly be diagnosed as psychotic and possibly schizophrenic. Yet, because many people share these same paranoid delusions and the delusions are literally propagated in memes and youtube videos (i.e., they do not originate spontaneously in my sister's head - as do most delusions in psychosis) then she is more aptly labeled confused, misled, brainwashed, gaslit, etc. And yet...it feels so similar to me. I know how to (well I think I have learned at least somewhat how to ) help someone with psychosis enter recovery. I know telling them their delusions are not real and that they need help does NOT work. I know medication often does work. And there is a fine balance of how to engage someone who is actively psychotic into seeking treatment before they bolt. Often they end up being forced initially. But the medication can really make marked improvements. 

I dont know how to help my sister. I know telling her that the delusions are not real wont work and hasnt worked. She totally shuts down and blocks my phone. But I also dont think medication will help. I feel it is probably more like trying to rescue someone from a cult. Which I have no experience with.

Black Death bubonic plague came to Italy from WuhanChina (yes you read that right). From Italy it spread through Europe. Some towns went into mass delusion where they believed the Jews were secretly kidnapping christian children to drink their blood for immunity from the plague. Sound familiar?  These towns often formed mobs who burned all the Jew at the stake. Other towns DI'DN‚ÄôT fall into such delusions and offered sanctuary to escaping Jews.

The word ‚Äúcabal‚Äù is from the Jewish holy book Kabbalah. 

I don‚Äôt know about plagues in pre-Christian societies but it‚Äôs easy for me to imagine people sacrificing animals or even other humans to appease the Death Gods.

These memes have been with humanity a LONG time. But never before have they been spread via internet.

735,"Family members have chosen Q, instead of the family","This is my second post to the group, and it pains me that I'm writing again. My story is long, but I'll try to keep it short. I have extended family that have always been extremely religious, and conservative. They've been into Q from the very beginning (5g, pedophile rings, bill gates, covid hoax, vaccine chip, etc.) 

In the fall a family member who believes covid is a hoax, gave my grandmother covid. My mother is her primary caretaker, so this family member exposed both my grandma and my mother to the virus. It was a long road to recovery, but thankfully both are recovered. 

Throughout the last few years when they'd talk about these conspiracies, to me it was absolutely crazy, but in the end sort of harmless. If those are the things you want to believe, then whatever. But when they endangered my mother and grandmother with covid, that completely flipped a switch for me. I told my parents that I'm done with that side of the family entirely. 

My immediate family members wanted to still try to work things out, and had given them forgiveness. They set up parameters, and said that the relationship is at risk if you go beyond them. Its been nothing but a disaster since then. Every conversation has some political jab, and they won't stop mentioning the conspiracies.

The last straw was a couple weeks ago. The family member that transmitted covid to my grandmother, was trying to talk her out of getting the vaccine. Stated that the vaccine is dangerous and it's killing people. After that, the s*** really hit the fan. There's a very likely chance that we will not be speaking or seeing those family members again, until they get out of Q.

I'm just at an absolute lose that these family members are choosing Q over family. For me, the relationship has been over since the fall, but feel horrible for my immediate family members that tried to work things out. I have a few questions below, that I'd like some input on:

Have any of you put up parameters, and your Q person actually respected thoss request? 

When questioned on these conspiracies, they use biblical verses and religion as their main defense. How do you fight against this?

737,Do you know someone that is Christian and believes Q is real?,"The Holy Spirit, God and Jesus would NOT guide anyone to believe Q. If a person claims to believe that Q is true and from God, then the person is being deceived by Satan. The Holy Spirit would guide you through reading the Bible as sound doctrine, not some man made conspiracy. The Bible mentions apostasy, false teachers, false prophets and doctrines of demons in the New Testament. And tells us to avoid these kinds of people.

I've included a poll to see how many professing ""Christians"" you guys know that believe Q is true.

738,I was kicked out of my moms house because I didn‚Äôt want to talk about her beliefs.,"In December of last year my mom kicked me out because every time she would bring up Trump or Q I told her I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. She told me that I was trying to ‚Äúsilence her‚Äù and she wouldn‚Äôt allow me to silence her in her own home. My intention was never to ‚Äúsilence her‚Äù I just wanted her to understand that if two people don‚Äôt agree on something they shouldn‚Äôt have to talk about it. She would continuously bring up her radicalized beliefs and every time it would turn into an argument. I was never able to have a civil conversation with her about anything because she make every conversation about Trump and she even went as far as to compare him to Jesus. Ive been in scary situations with her, she‚Äôll tell me I‚Äôm not ‚Äúascending‚Äù or she‚Äôll attack me psychically or emotionally. She‚Äôll insult my intelligence by calling me names and call me a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù. I can barely talk to my mother now without being on edge or there being tension. She has completely let herself go. The women who raised me was strong and independent. She has gone through a lot recently with her mother passing away, a break up, and she‚Äôs been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which made all of her losses take a toll on her mental health. I believe Q preys on people like my mother, people who have mental illness or are vulnerable. I‚Äôve tried to help my mom but honestly I think the only person who can help her is herself. She‚Äôs so hell bent on believing in Q and has even started her own little Facebook cult. She‚Äôs lost everyone closest to her. My uncle has cancer and because of all of this she believes he‚Äôs evil and deserves cancer. She doesn‚Äôt check up on him or anyone. She just stays in her hoarder room and watches YouTube videos all day. She‚Äôs stopped paying rent and has even lost her car because she stopped making the payments.

I told him that I would not wait for him to think there whether he wants to be with me or not.  blocked him everywhere and left.  I can't believe that some conspiracy can change a person so much.

741,Biggest blowout yet with Q parent,"I saw my parent‚Äôs today for the first time in awhile. I posted a while back that my dad and brother went to DC January 6th, and things have been very tense (but also avoidant) in my family ever since. I‚Äôve tried to keep my distance and had successfully avoided any conversation about Trump, Covid, etc until tonight. Unfortunately, we got onto the topic somehow, and my dad completely EXPLODED on me in a complete fit of rage. He was swearing at us, telling us we know nothing, calling me names, told me to grow the f**k up...you name it. My dad has a history of emotional and verbally abusive behaviours so this wasn‚Äôt completely new to me, but I haven‚Äôt endured it yet when it comes to his Q/Trump beliefs. He took some very personal jabs at me too, which truthfully hurt a lot. I am doing my best to keep civility and peace within my family but am at my wit‚Äôs end. I am devastated by this situation and am dealing with unrelated personal stressors on top of it all. I am struggling and he even threw that in my face in his scary attempt to defend his beliefs. He even threatened violence on my significant other. I don‚Äôt honestly believe he would follow through on any of this but I am obviously shaken. Just came here for support and commiseration if nothing else. I might look into some personal counselling to try to heal from my family issues.

But I know now that it's not worth it. Today I sat quietly and listened to my mom repeatedly ignore my requests to change the subject. I'm biased of course, but trust me when I say that I did not raise my voice, debate, or disagree... just asked her to stop after several minutes of monologue. 

To her, anything and everything is related to Donald Trump and the crooked media. You could be talking about an apple and it reminds her that Biden is stealing millions of jobs.

750,Question,"Hi there, I wrote to an admin. here to ask permission to post  but I‚Äôm guessing that they were too busy to respond, so I decided to just post anyway. 
My name is Kim and I run a number of platforms on anti-racism, corruption, and inequality in America. 
I have a very educated father who has gone off the deep end with Trump conspiracy theories. So I very much can relate to the immense pain I‚Äôm reading about on this site. 
I believe this whole Qanon deception is yet another symptom of our nations choice to elect officials who do not have personal integrity. What‚Äôs happening in our Dem. Republic is complicated but not unprecedented, sadly.
The reason I am posting is I wanted to ask if there was anyone on this site who would benefit personally from doing a video interview about either their experience with Qanon or how a close family member‚Äôs experience has impacted them. I‚Äôm paid by no one and my allegiance is to the truth ... your story and your truth.
 I‚Äôve done a number of interviews with people who have become members of organizations who have aberrant ideologies or are outside of social norms but have made it out. Integrity and the well-being of the people I interview are my absolute first priority. I will NEVER POST without verbal recorded or written consent after you approve the final video. This is about your story. Also I do not interview people for any reason other than that they would glean something from doing it. I am not here to hurt anyone... but to help explain so people can understand the human side of all this. 
I‚Äôve interviewed the reformed leader of the Mississippi Aryan Brotherhood. I‚Äôve interviewed  an overt racist from Tennessee who now helps educate white folks, and many others.  
I do live shows and post videos on many topics that help people understand inequality, corruption, racism, and bigotry in America today. I work from a historical and scientific viewpoint. 
I want to understand snd I want my viewers to understand the power Qanon seems to have over people. I want to understand the human side of how this sort of thing happens. 
 Please get a hold of me if you think you would benefit from telling your story. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have. If at any time during the process you change your mind about doing a video, I will delete it all with no questions asked. I do not create videos at the emotional expense of my fellow humans. Some people benefit from sharing their story because it can really go a long way to help others. For others who are private, there no way they‚Äôd ever be comfortable doing this.

I found out about his beliefs when quarantine started, and he started questioning if COVID was overhyped. We got into MASSIVE fights about it for a couple of weeks and finally, he ended things with me. 

I am a scientist, and I left a religious cult about 5 years ago... so I feel well versed in determining what is valid evidence or not. I also would say I‚Äôm very open minded. But these... just aren‚Äôt even probable at all. And he.... just did not see it.

I recently talked to him again, and he is even deeper in conspiracies. 

I guess I just don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this.

It‚Äôs kind of a self fulfilling project- if you‚Äôre looking for something weird- you can find it anywhere if you read into things enough.
And this just reinforces beliefs held by Q follower.

It just feels hopeless. My Q person has only gotten worse and I feel more and more distressed to see the number of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on their Facebook page leap but hundreds every few days, as more Q people connect with them.

In the beginning I would spend an hour or so each day in this futile gesture to report anything that was against facebooks guidelines and Q related. Even though I knew it wasn‚Äôt doing anything and Facebook rarely removed the posts, it kind of made me feel a little better at the time....

I‚Äôd been kinda hoping when March 4th comes and goes and yet again nothing happens that things might get better, but honestly I don‚Äôt think they will and I think I have to bow out of trying at all trying to help my Q person.

759,Could people be drawn to conspiracy theories if they've had adverse childhood experiences growing up? (Addicted to stress hormones and unwittingly seeking out things that will alarm them and suck them in further?),"I read this text by a psychologist and wondered, what percent of people who get sucked into Qanon &amp; fear spirals grew up ""primed"" for this because of unhealthy childhood dynamics? Here's the original text:

. . .

""Adults addicted to their own stress hormones were once children who lived in unpredictable environments of overreaction, rage spirals, and fear."" Dr. Nicole LePera (@theholisticpsychologist)¬†

She further writes:  
""My childhood environment was stable‚Äî meaning my parents were home + all of my physical needs were met. Dinner was at the same time. There was routine.  
But, it was also unpredictable. My dad, overwhelmed with pressure would erupt into yelling fits. My mom would completely shut down into silent treatments that would last for weeks. Because they could not regulate their own emotions, I developed severe anxiety as a child. One of my own childhood memories is around age 7 thinking someone would break in. Or cyclical thoughts that I‚Äôd wake up + someone would have died. A manifestation of the stress held in my body‚Äî + a nervous system that couldn‚Äôt cope.

This steady stream of hormones (adrenaline + cortisol) has all of us in an emotional cycle of highs + lows. Or chaos then lifeless exhaustion of irritability. Unconsciously‚Äî I would seek this in my adult romantic relationships. I‚Äôd push or knit pick.

When nothing was ‚Äòhappening‚Äô I was bored.

I became accustomed to connection + love through my own bodies stress response. It‚Äôs how I felt like ‚Äòme.‚Äô It‚Äôs how I felt connected to others.

Emotional states create hormonal responses that when experienced long term‚Äî imprint both mind + body.

If we learned these states as children, we become adults living in a cycle of our bodies seeking these hormonal responses. All of this is unconscious.

Many adrenaline junkies are seeking that familiar pattern. So are many of us who engage in ‚Äòon + off‚Äô relationship dynamics.

Or spend hours of days consuming content that leaves us feeling angry, helpless, + resentful. Just as we did as children.

Healing is becoming conscious to when we unconsciously seek chaos + stressful states‚Äî why we do it + how often. With this awareness, we can begin to choose moments of peace + teach our bodies safety in the present moment.

There‚Äôs no shame in being caught in these cycles that the body has learned. The addictive nature is very real + so is the withdrawal."" \~Dr. Nicole LePera, The Holistic Psychologist

She is so quick to gobble up pseudoscience left and right when it fits her narrative, but actual evidence based peer reviewed studies are all meaningless to her. She buys it all 5G, anti-vax, covid hoax, etc, and the worst is some discredited doctor she listens to that claims their is a dangerous 'sleeper agent' or something in the covid vaccine that can be triggerd in the future by another chemical injection. And the fact that the doctor is discredited is a positive thing in her mind, because it shows she isn't going along with the narrative and they've tried to silence her for it.

761,Just kicked my Q mom out of my new apartment,"This will hopefully be my last post here for a while. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mom ever since she fell into that cult but today I‚Äôm finally free of living with her and don‚Äôt have to put up with her nonsense. Today I was moving in to my new apartment and my parents were helping me out. Our relationship has been mostly fine since the election since we rarely bring up politics. But today as I was putting together some furniture she passingly mentions the office Melania Trump started and I said it was weird she had her own office since she barely did anything and my mom got mad and started defending her.

She said that as a woman she could sympathize with her and respect her intelligence as a model who got with an intelligent man like Trump and ended up as First Lady and that she‚Äôs always thinking about what to do next. I kind of let her go on her monologue because I knew what I wanted to respond so I just let her finish.

Once she was done I responded ‚Äúso how come you don‚Äôt ever defend Michelle Obama as a woman?‚Äù And she said that Michelle wasn‚Äôt a woman that she was secretly a man and that she had seen the pictures that confirms this or whatever. I got so pissed I immediately called her out on her blatant racism and transphobia and told her that the she can‚Äôt defend Melania ‚Äúas a woman‚Äù and then immediately disrespect another woman just because she disagrees with her.

She apologized and said I had a point but that she had just gotten really upset I would attack Melania like that and I flat out told her ‚Äúthis is my apartment, under my name, I pay the bills and I will talk shit about whoever I want and if you don‚Äôt like it you can leave‚Äù. So then she did. And my dad tried to talk to me but I wasn‚Äôt having it. I told him he could go get his wife and handle that because I can assemble my own damn chairs.

764,My mom and sister are slowly falling for Q and I don‚Äôt know how to stop it,"Five years ago my sister had expressed to me that if Bernie Sanders had won the 2016 primaries that she‚Äôd be voting for him. Five years ago my mother scoffed and shook her head in shame at the thought of someone showing support for Donald Trump and his hateful rhetoric. By the end of that year, both women ended up voting for him and never looked back. Now in 2021, both women have shared terabytes of misinformation on social media, egged on by my brother‚Äôs girlfriend and my dad‚Äôs sister both of whom are ardent Trump supporters and anti-vaxx. 

They aren‚Äôt at the point where they believe that Trump will save the world, but they‚Äôre close. They believe that pedophiles are rampant in our government and in Hollywood but fail to provide any evidence of this. They have both begun having reservations about vaccines even though my sister has already vaccinated her own daughter and my mother has vaccinated all of her children and used to be a supporter of vaccination. I blame both my brother‚Äôs girlfriend and my aunt. They took my family‚Äôs trust and subtlety whispered lies into their ears, whether intentional or not is still decrepit. I spend hours a day arguing with my soon to be sister-in-law on social media who is just too stubborn to see the facts. 

I now fear they are headed down a dark path of which will take years to recover from. My sister has become more and more hateful towards minorities, specifically black people. She constantly looks for some way to bring up the ‚Äúdouble standard‚Äù that black people have in that they can get away with rioting and it be called patriotic, which has never happened. She called the rioters at the capitol protestors and refused to blame Trump for their actions. My mother has stated to my girlfriend (and not to me because she knows I‚Äôd confront her about that shit) that she will not get the COVID vaccine and that she thinks there isn‚Äôt enough research. Luckily I‚Äôm 21 and do not require my mother‚Äôs permission to get vaccinated. My sister has blocked me on almost all social media, I can‚Äôt see pictures or funny videos of my baby niece without asking my girlfriend to show me, all because she says I‚Äôm so ‚Äúclose minded‚Äù. My sister has become a racist and my mother an antivaxxer and it angers me every day. 

tl;dr: I think my sister and mom are heading down the rabbit hole due to the changes I‚Äôve seen in them during the Trump administration.",QAnonCasualties
765,This is not a post I want to make,"Watching people you love slowly accept and buy into the Qanon conspiracy is heartbreaking to me. Seeing my parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles and others truly believe this stuff is insane to me. The people I thought I knew are not really here anymore, they have checked out, they have joined a cult. 

This is not a post I want to write or enjoy writing, but here we are.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I think buying into this stuff happens slowly over the years. I don't know if anyone else feels this way also (please comment if you do) but I think this can be traced back over a decade ago to when Qanon was not even a thing. My grandparents had recently retired and subsequently were faced with more free time. My family has always been more conservative than liberal, and originally we were not super ultra-conservative people, but generally believed in stuff like personal responsibility, tradition, rule of law, less taxes in general, regulation might not always be a good thing, etc. So when my grandparents retied they began spending more and more time watching Fox News, where they would listen to this stuff for a good portion of the day. I remember my grandmother driving my siblings and I somewhere when I was 13 and she had some radio talk show person on, who eventually started commenting about the Obama administration. My grandmother then told us about how Obama was really a Muslim, and was not born here, and is not a real American. When you are that young I don't think you really grasp the significance of saying something like that, but looking back its a telltale sign. Those embers of conspiracy theories have always kind of been there in my family, slowly simmering under the surface and eventually gave way to Q.

Over the years my grandparents would tell these things to their kids and in-laws who would listen, did not necessarily mean that they believed everything but they listened. It's become more and more apparent over the years. Another time I stopped by my grandparents house about 2 years ago and in the 2 hours I was there,  probably 75% of the time was them talking about how the left and Democrats are trying to destroy America, when I just stopped in to surprise them since I was in the area. That was the last time I ever did that. Now after 4 years of these things being injected into the mainstream, they were primed and ready for something like Qanon. My grandparents bought in lock stock and barrel and took other family members down with them over the quarantine when they had nothing but time and spent it on the internet where it was being circulated. They fully believe these things. Now after the election and pandemic with baseless fraud claims and theories about the virus being fake out there, they bought into those also. My family is full of hard-working, good, kind, thoughtful and loving people. I have never felt anything other than support and love from them. But now I am almost viewed as a traitor for not buying into Q like they did.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way or has realized this; but I think stuff like fox news or conservative talk radio have really acted as stepping stones for Qanon. I think people who buy into one thing end up falling down a rabbit hole that leads to Qanon and all the attendant lunacy that it comes with. I don't know what to do, anytime I try to reason with them they say I am brainwashed and indoctrinated by the liberal media. I feel like there is no reasoning with them anymore. To quote a political strategist, ""Sometimes you can't get to a yes with a person who is so utterly implacable, they won't say anything other than no."" 

I also want to add something I think is important to my story. I have been a conservative person and identified as a republican all my life. A lot of the things I have believed in like a strong military, fiscal and personable responsibility, free trade, and originalism to name a few, I still believe in. But now I feel like I am in the minority on my side of the spectrum. Being a conservative today means you worship Donald Trump, think he is the rightful commander-in-chief after a fraudulent election, and believe in whatever conspiracy theories he endorses. So it's just frustrating to me when I am called a defector and betrayer of the faith for not endorsing lunacy. I am essentially a conservative in exile: too old-school republican for the left and not crazy enough for the right.

Qanon has debased any political ideology in my family. I feel like they are part of a cult. I don't know what to do to address this anymore. Any time I push back I am mocked and discounted, and whenever I stay silent it is taken as complicity and validates these claims in their minds. I feel like I can't win no matter what I do. If anyone has any advice or wants to share something please comment. Thank you.",QAnonCasualties
766,The shouting match finally happened and I can't do it anymore.,"He refused to get vaccinated because he thinks thinks it somehow changes your DNA and compromises your immune system. I have no idea how he can even believe this nonsense. He won't accept any information from *any* media source, only word of mouth on social media. He thinks media companies are *all* compromised and nothing they say is valid. He even joined Parler. Yet somehow his neighbors are the kind of trump supporters that he's scared of, completely blind to the fact that he's becoming them. I don't think I can look him in the eyes anymore.",QAnonCasualties
767,I don‚Äôt know how to talk to my Qmom anymore.,"We live in Canada about a 5 hour drive away from one another and haven‚Äôt been able to see each other since COVID started. Every phone conversation will somehow lead to something QAnon related. She will go on long tangents or call me crying asking whether my boyfriend and I have been enlightened yet; she automatically gets angry when I tell her that no matter what we each believe, we can‚Äôt change anything. Just need to wait it out. That started leading to how she would be at the forefront of the protests against vaccines or pro-Trump rallies if there were more in her area. 

I‚Äôm struggling with respecting her opinions, she calls me stupid and ignorant although I have a degree and a job within the government. My position is considered essential which is now another reason she calls me crying in fear of me getting vaccinated.",QAnonCasualties

769,Is My Sister Q?,"My sister has gone down the rabbit hole over the last 12 years. It started with the Obama presidency and now its off the rails. She quotes sources like Lou Dobbs, Dan Bongino, Maria Bartiromo and others. She uses words and phrases like Fake News, Cabal, Sheep, White Hats, Black Hats, Big Pharma, Big Tech. As far as I know, she hasn't mentioned satan worshiping pedophiles but that's about it. Do you think she's Q or just an ultra right wing conspiracy nut?

I don't have a relationship with her anymore. She is very smug and acts like she has superior knowledge. She is convinced I voted for China and am one of the sheep. She spends hours and hours posting the same drivel and has gotten kicked off of multiple sites because of her conspiratorial beliefs. I don't think there is any getting through to her. She had a psychotic break about 20 years sgo and I think that has made her very cynical and skeptical about our government. Does this sound like Q behavior?",QAnonCasualties

She is scared of me. I don't know how to delicately talk about this, or if I should just give up and ignore it.",QAnonCasualties
775,Indirectly losing my husband to QAnon,"My husband has always been relatively conservative, but even from the beginning of Trump, he thought the guy was a con-man. His family on the other hand embraced Trumpism wholeheartedly, and then when they perceived even regular right-wing media outlets as being ""too liberal"" (aka too critical of Trump), they turned to some really darks parts of the internet for information, which as you can guess, led them to QAnon.

I remember when I first told my husband about QAnon last summer, he laughed and thought it was some hyper fringe thing and the media was probably blowing its prevalence out of proportion. Now that so much of his family has embraced it, he's a little horrified, but he thinks he can use reason and logic to get them back into a shared plane of reality. 

This has caused a lot of strain in my marriage. I don't want to spend time around his family any more. They literally can't even talk about puppies and the weather without turning it into some Q shit. They openly call me a communist who hates American and supports pedophiles. I've never heard my husband try to seriously defend me from these accusations and whenever I bring up how insulting their words are, he shrugs it off saying, ""they're just passionate about what they believe and said something they didn't really mean"" and ""you're just being too sensitive.""

Yet whenever I call his family crazy or point out that they're peddling lies that are destroying the fabric of our society, he immediately tells me to stop bashing them. The other night he literally said ""I need to stop picking on his family just because they have differing views."" He tells me I just need to take a break from the news and stop being so triggered by his family. 

The truth is, I don't ever bring up his family: *he* does. I would prefer not to have any talk of Q in my house, but he talks to them every day and patiently listens as they rant about Q stuff. He still tries to refute it, but it usually it just ends up with a lot of equivocating about how *yes*, he thinks Joe Biden is really creepy and okay maybe *sometimes* conspiracies have been true and sure, maybe there was *some* election fraud but probably not enough to affect the outcome of the election.

I now feel like I'm in a battle with his family over my husband's grasp on reality. I'm starting to feel like they're gaining ground. There's absolutely no way he's going to stop talking to them. He says all the time that he will never put politics over family, but lately it feels like he's putting his family over our marriage, and because all his family cares about is Trump and QAnon, he is in effect putting their politics over they family we've made together. I'm not his blood but we've been married for 8 years. *I'm* his family too. 

To anyone who lost a loved one to this conspiracy, how did it start?",QAnonCasualties
776,Lost a good friend to this nonsense,"I don't know if my friend, like me a disabled Army vet, is specifically into QAnon, but all the symptoms are there. We met doing advanced scuba training so we could teach scuba for a non-profit charity that gets disabled vets scuba certified and runs group trips. We thought that it would help show that if we (I am an amputee and he has limited use of his shoulder and arm) could do it, anyone can. 

  
We never had a political conversation....until trump got elected. 

  
Over the past year or so he has totally changed. He has become embittered, drinks heavily, and began having thoughts of harming others and himself in some grand gesture.

The last 3 times he called me, he immediately launched into a tirade about how only Fox news tells the truth and literally every other source on the planet is lying. It is this oddly specific fascination with fox news and trump as a savior that can do no wrong. It's just weird how he obsesses over specifically fox news and seems to get 100% of his 'information' from that source without ever questioning it. 

At first I tried to just debunk his nonsense- so our phone conversations became me having to Google facts to 'prove' his claims false. He would throw out some ridiculous claim, or just deny my points were valid until I was forced to provide a bibliography for everything I said. You can image how unfun that is. We stopped talking about scuba diving ages ago. 

After this went on, I have to admit I stopped being so polite and these conversations became arguments. I let my frustration come thru, exasperated with not only this crazy obsession with fox news, but his increasingly radicalized and hateful beliefs about anyone that dared question this new reality. He didn't have an opinion of his own, he was simply regurgitating whatever fox news told him. 

The final call came where he began the conversation bragging to me about how much he was drinking lately. Like he was proud of this. Then launched into his fox news obsession once again. My mistake was engaging again, and it ended up in a shouting match. I had mentioned a statistic, he challenged it so again I was forced to provide a source (in this case the US census) to prove my claim. I was right, he was clearly wrong. He accepted that but then jumped to dismissing statistics as a whole. It was insane on it's face- anything that damages their crazy world view is either a lie, or suddenly irrelevant. But in the next sentence tried to use statistics he pulled out of nowhere (well, pulled from fox news) just moments after telling me statistics are all lies. I lost my cool at that point, and I feel bad about it.   
He then confided in me that he was thinking that the VA was doing him wrong, and if they didn't see things his way, he would go to DC and harm others and himself in some violent gesture. He was vague on exactly what he would do, but it was incredibly alarming. I chalk it up to alcohol fueled bravery that he wouldn't act on. It's hard to tell when someone that is halfway thru a bottle is serious or not. 

At some point he hung up on me (by now we were in a full on shouting match) and texted me that we were no longer friends. That it was my attitude that wasn't up to his standards. Nevermind that it was him calling me, drunk, and spouting violence and self harm. Nevermind that the entire call was to get me indoctrinated into believing fox news, and only fox news. To my sober mind, it was nothing short of batshit insane. It just didn't make sense, and this wasn't the friend that I had known for several years. I know his family, I was the first friend he had at his new house. But now he is angry, fearful, lost in a sea of propaganda he can't tell from reality. Anyone that doesn't agree with him needs conversion...I can only imagine the environment at home for his wife and kids. 

That's my story about this nonsense. A good friend where I have very few, lost to toxic propaganda and hateful rhetoric. A quiet racism where ethnicity is a scapegoat. A world where the guy caught red handed trying to steal an election is somehow innocent and had the election stolen from him. I never heard of QAnon before- but I consider it all part and parcel of trumpism. I am not sure he even knows what QAnon is, but is a member of the cult nonetheless.

778,Lost family and a friend to Q,"I stopped talking to my aunt and cousin who is a cop of all things. They have fallen off the deep end with Q and their radical Trump supporting beliefs. My aunt who is a high school drop out has told me and the rest of the family that college is where they indoctrinate liberals.
She constantly sends my mom  conspiracy theory videos on YouTube and other radical Q websites. I finally cut her out of my life after she tried to pick a fight with me after I told her I didn't want to hear about how the election was stolen by the blood drinking democrats. My cousin who is a cop fuels the fire with my aunt and they both have become so radical in a short amount of time. They both lives in California which in its self is hilarious.  My poor mom has to deal with her because she takes care of my 99 year old grandmother. She even took my grandmothers car and put it in her name after trashing 2 other cars she got for free. But her behavior is acceptable because she is a ""christian.""  As a believer in Jesus Christ I get upset because she comes from a place of hate which Jesus was not about or for.  
I also lost a friend who I've known for years and he is college educated of all things, he has a masters in history and I saw slowly how he was becoming more radical. Blaming Jan 6th on antifia because you know they dressed up as Trump supporters. Blaming the fires in CA this past summer on antifia saying they were starting fires on purpose. Believes covid is a hoax and got aggressive  with me because I wear a mask and take it seriously.  I just finally said screw it and haven't heard from him since right after Jan 6th.

My husband asked him why he was buying so many and I was told it was to protect the house from antifa. They had a huge fight about it and didn‚Äôt speak for six weeks.

We know he voted for Trump both elections. And last week we talked to my father-in-law and found out that he threatened to disown him because my father-in-law who voted for Trump in 2016 switched to Biden because he felt that Trump had lied and did nothing for him or anyone else.

I know that this could also be indicative of involvement in right wing or white supremacist groups rather than Q.

794,The USA Patriot Group Must Setup New Party To Educate People &amp; Win The Game,"**The USA Patriot Group Must Setup New Party To Educate People &amp; Win The Game**  
Source: **freejoy.aimoo.com**

The problem of United States Of America is lack of a real godlike leader.  
They   are losing on trade because they are too stupid, despite the fact they   are holding the most powerful tool of the game, which is technology.

If   Donald Trump the best CEO in USA who have the most real life  experience  cannot fix help America, then there is no any other CEO of  any  cooperation or any other American people can help. Because running a   business to take money from the sleepy public people is not as the  same  as take money from the same ‚Äúlevel‚Äù opponent which are other  leader  groups from other nations.  
You can only deceive the stupid public people, but you cannot deceive the smart people.

The last hope for the USA is me the real savior Messiah Buddha.  
This article is the last signal I can give you for free of charge.

I have provided few ideologies about the future system. But in particular the USA situation, the solution should be like this:  
**Step 1:**  Setup  new political party which ideology of ‚Äúeverybody is equal,  everybody  can become president‚Äù. No left, no right, no central, only  ‚Äúgood,  suitable‚Äùpolicies, all people from all background are welcome.

**Step 2:**  Educate  the public people about the political system and what is  corruption,  and explain to them the only way to reduce corruption which  is give back  power to local government and the people.

**Step 3:**  Win the  election and allow new states to be established. In the new  states,  minimum wage will start from $0, and not under the federal  government  rule. Some example new states such as ‚Äúonly undocumented  migrants‚Äù or  ‚Äúonly black/white/yellow skin people‚Äù.

With this strategy, even in the current global financial system rule the problem around trade will be solved.

By   having new political party with ‚Äúleaderless‚Äù, you are waking‚ÄúGod‚Äù  power  within everybody. The only different between the‚Äúpoliticians‚Äù and  you  are just they are corrupted and you are not.

If you cannot have a new political party to education people, you cannot win this game.

Starting   from 0 point seems hard but with 4 years, you can easily win the   upcoming 2024 election. Because you are using the better ‚ÄúGod‚Äù ideology   of life than the fake voting democracy.

I  have a lot of other  strategies and methods to win this easy game, but I  cannot giving out  for free because there are many other nations as  well.

Make fair  amount of  donation, then I will giving out more details and other  Godlike  strategies which no any entities can counter it for they are the  Divine  way of life.

795,New to the sub: A brief introduction and some tips for shutting diffusing a q anon rant.,"Hey guys. I'm sorry to say that the shared psychosis that is q anon has finally made its way to my family. My aunt, mother, and father were all Trump supporters who listened to right-wing talk radio, but never really got into conspiracy theories, until the Capitol riot kicked off all the talk about martial law and such. Now they have been gradually digging into q anon at a very alarming rate. 

I used to be a conspiracy theorist between the years of 2010-2015, so I have an idea of the pathological effects q anon can have on one's mind. It took me years to heal myself from the self-inflicted psychological wounds that came with the conspiracy theory mindset. Before, I used to be the ""nut-job"" of the family, thinking everything was a false-flag event, and now, my Christian family has latched on to q anon's propaganda like its the Gospel, and they seem to be degenerating faster than I was. It's like I just got away from my old mind-set, and now its all around me, haunting me. It's really a bizarre experience. 

I don't really know how to help my family members, but I can't just let them go crazy without saying something. I tried listening to them. That's what I wanted when I was into the NWO theories. I even asked them questions within the parameters of what they present me to try and gently point out the absurd contradictions in their *Theory of Everything*. 

Their logic is not penetrable. You can't fact check the overwhelming amount of lies and half-truths q anon puts out, and when you do, they twist the context to fit it into their theory. 

My family and I are all Christians, so I've found that the only thing that will silence them is to show how q anon runs against the teachings of Jesus Christ--**who told us to keep the peace to the best of our ability, love our neighbor as ourselves, and not to resist our enemies (but treat them with love).** I've managed to successfully diffuse two arguments with that approach, but it doesn't look like they've really budged in their q anon beliefs. Hopefully, if I keep trying, they will have to face their internal beliefs surrounding Christ. 

Maybe this technique will backfire. Who knows? Maybe they'll resent me even more for pointing out how q anon is contrary to their core identity. I don't know. What I do know is that things went from 0 to 80% crazy for my family in less than a week. I doubt this is an isolated phenomenon. 

Do you guys have any tips or experiences to share?

Thanks.",QAnonCasualties
796,Ugh. Mom,"Idk. I just need to vent. 

I am at such a loss. I‚Äôve always been super close and protective of my mom, especially since my dad passed 15 years ago. But ever since the august 2020 she‚Äôs gone into the Q-hole. 

It‚Äôs shocking because politics have never been an issue. She voted Obama twice and tends to side middle of the road on most issues. But now it‚Äôs trump trump trump. Obama was awful from day 1 blah blah blah. 

We‚Äôve never really been a huge political family and have respected each persons views. But now that‚Äôs just gone. I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot seeing the world with open eyes.‚Äù I‚Äôve begged her to stop getting news from her friends off Facebook. But it‚Äôs just getting worse and worse. I can‚Äôt even have a conversation without it getting political. I‚Äôve given ultimatums. Which I regret. But it doesn‚Äôt matter. 

I guess I‚Äôm just sad because I‚Äôm losing my mom. I don‚Äôt recognize this person she‚Äôs becoming. Someone who I trusted and would seek advice from is now angry, anxious, scary, and just everything that goes along with Q. And I‚Äôm at a loss. My siblings can ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with it but I‚Äôm very outspoken and will voice my concerns. But this is really destroying our relationship. And it‚Äôs incredibly sad. 

Just venting I guess.",QAnonCasualties

798,QPersons and the United States Constitution,"My co worker is a victim to Q stuff and I have a history education degree. I enjoy politics and I love knowing how things like our government works. 

He often brings Q items up in conversation. He‚Äôs never mentioned Q and I‚Äôve never brought it up to him. When he isn‚Äôt talking about Q, I feel that he is a very good person at heart. 

I‚Äôve noticed his obsession with protecting the constitution but clearly having no understanding of how it works. He believes the election was stolen and everyone (courts, states, congresspeople etc.) is corrupt and that the military can seize power to protect the constitution. 

Of course, I explain to him that constitutionally speaking Biden is our president. All the required constitutional activities happened to determine our next president. People voted, states certified, congress counted, and Biden swore his oath and became president. The military itself would be breaking its oath by seizing power and installing a leader. 

He believes Mike Lindell over the courts. I don‚Äôt think he has ever read the court cases and thinks they provided overwhelming evidence. Read a bit on the cases and you will see the Trumps campaign offered little evidence and often picked fights over inconsequential numbers of votes. 

Has anyone else run into this odd misinterpretation of the constitution? The worry about individual freedom (something that is important to me as well) but also supporting a military takeover is so hard for me to even talk about. The basic understanding of how our government works just isn‚Äôt something he had. It can feel impossible to approach these subjects when living it totally different realities.",QAnonCasualties
799,What is qanon,Title,QAnonCasualties
800,Does anyone else think entertainment themes has primed qanon believers?,"By that I mean the prevalence of conspiracy theories in film, books, TV, even video games. Doesn‚Äôt feel like there was as much of this a few decades ago. The villains were more often individuals or readily identifiable groups of bad guys where now it‚Äôs all betrayal by people the hero previously trusted who are part of a grand evil organization. Sure, there have been actual conspiracies in history but the competency and reach of qanon enemies just seems fictional. IMO real people aren‚Äôt competent enough for    a functional canal.

Guess I‚Äôm trying to make sense of how we got here.",QAnonCasualties
801,Anyone familiar with Children's Health Defender? Feel like my father is slipping.,"Hi r/QAnonCasualties, I never really pictured myself posting an actual post here, but alas here I am. My father was a former Alex Jones listener back in 2008 until about 2014, my father absolutely hated Barack Obama, but now can admit he was okay; however my Dad said he listened to it for mostly ""satire"" as the stories were insanely outlandish (the one we joke about is the FEMA deathcamps). My Dad as a lifelong Republican unsurprisingly voted for Donald Trump and ate up the loud mouth bigotry Trump spewed. My Mother an independent even did the same. My Dad supported Trump until about 2019, I can't exactly say when the tide turned for sure, but with the pandemic my Dad suddenly became terrified. He actually started wearing a mask back in February, and myself as a healthcare worker, he would lose his mind when I showed up after a shift in February. Suddenly, it was like the veil was lifted, he realized Trump was completely incompetent as soon after I lost my job, classes went online, I started sheltering in place, etc. My father suddenly realized, nobody had a plan and a lot of people were going to die. 

During this time, he was also laid off and had a death in the family so he retired, this is key here because it gave him all the time in the world ""to do research"". His sleep schedule was soon thrown completely off and he would sleep all day and stay up all night, rinse and repeat. So while he still hated Trump and acknowledged COVID was a dangerous threat and that mask wearing was incredibly crucial to stopping the spread; he'd also say crazy shit like ""you know this was made in a lab right?"" followed by him linking me to a super discredited ""research"" paper by a discredited Chinese scientist who claimed the virus escaped a lab in Wuhan. I pointed out the logical and bias flaws in the paper, including looking up multiple ""companies"" and ""contractors"" mentioned who all were not real individuals. He seemed to acknowledge it with a ""thank God you know how to really rip these things apart, guess you're learning something in college!""

So life was good until about the end of May when the George Floyd protests started, suddenly his old racism was back, calling the protestors thugs and looters who ""need to stop mooching off me and get back to work."" This was a tense period of time for us as I attend school for public health and my interest is in the social determinants of health, so I literally research the inequities these communities of color face and their impacts on their health. Eventually, my father surprisingly caved, and admitted that a lot of cops are out of line and ridiculous. Life again was good, the election came and went and my parents were elated that Biden won, myself more relieved (?) that things would slowly return to the capitalist nightmare we lived in before Trump. 

With December coming, I slowly was promoted in my healthcare role and qualified for the first round of COVID vaccines (Pfizer) at my job, I excitedly signed up for the vaccine and told everyone I knew I was getting it so they could come to my about my personal experience, I hoped this would alleviate some of the fear mongering going around; especially in my rural hometown. I got the vaccine and visited my parents that weekend, my father was suddenly angry and outraged that I had gone through with getting the vaccine, telling me ""Why would you get that fucking poison injected into you? Willingly?"" To which I replied, I had done plenty of reading into studies about mRNA vaccines, their safety, how they are created, and read the individual data on the Pfizer and Moderna reports to which I concluded that the risk vs benefit ratio was significantly in my favor for benefit. My father gave me the classic ""Oh you think you know everything going to college hmm? Smart man all of a sudden?"" I was outraged and insanely upset, telling my mother that I would happily schedule an appointment for her, but my father was on his own since all of a sudden, he was a vaccine expert. My mother later texted me saying my father was sorry and that he wanted me to look for an appointment for him. 

Queue to this week, my father was set to go out of town to visit a friend down south at the beach, all of a sudden the friend cancelled because a contact of his got COVID from a friend coming out of town, my father's friend decided the risk wasn't worth it and cancelled. My father sick of being at home was devastated, coming up with all kinds of crazy nonsensical reasons why his friend cancelled i.e. he must hate me, he's tired of me visiting, etc. So a few days ago, I call my father absolutely shaking, I got him a COVID vaccine appointment, it was a bit of a ways away, about an hour drive, but he was set to go. Suddenly he texts me saying ""I don't trust it."" So I kind of give him some time to process it, figuring he woke up grumpy as it was 8am and he was a night owl. I text him a ""I don't really know how to respond, so I'll give you some time to think things over, talk soon bye."" Queue to tonight, he texts me asking about his appointment and if it's cancelled. I tell him that his appointment is still on since it's 2 weeks away so I figured I'd give him a little over a week to consider it. 

And now to the point of this long winded post, he links me to [Children's Health Defense - the Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/) , so I do a few quick searches and find that it is known for its anti-vaccine activism. I also pick an article at random and point out all the issues with it such as the Bell's Palsy cases are the same percentage as those in the population who randomly acquire Bell's Palsy, meaning it's unrelated to the vaccine. I also say out of 10 million plus doses of the vaccine, 600 ""reported deaths"" is incredibly low and mention that most of them once again, match the number of random cardiac deaths in the population. All my father says is ""I'm glad I read this before it's too late, these people are actual doctors, how am I not supposed to believe them!"" and then went on to ridicule my academic career (you're just a semester away from a MPH, these people have MDs!!). I'm not really sure what to do as I broke my whole family out of this crazy Trumplican cycle this past Spring (my mother was the easiest, followed by my younger brother, and then my Dad). I felt like I was making such incredible progress within my family and my ""radical liberal politics"" such as free healthcare and free education were becoming normal dinner talking points with good conversation. Now all of a sudden, vaccines are bullshit, I'm better off if everyone else gets it, etc. I also reminded him that he regularly smokes good ole cowboy killers AKA marlboro reds and that he never gave a shit about what was in them and what they did to his body, but suddenly he's concerned about ""long term effects from a vaccine, it's too new, I don't want that mRNA shit, I'll wait for the J&amp;J shot."" So I guess in the end it's not awful as he said he'll gladly get the J&amp;J shot since it's a altered virus rather than mRNA, but who knows if that'll hold up since that same garbage website Children's Health Defense comes up with some crazy article saying J&amp;J gives you COVID. 

If you've read this far, thank you. It feels good to type all of this out, I can't really say this aloud to anyone in person since the only people I really see in person are at work and unfortunately about half of them (in healthcare nonetheless!) are also crazy Trumplican / QAnon believers.",QAnonCasualties
802,How to deal with anger?,"I‚Äôm far from an angry person. I have been so patient for years. For the first time this week, I have anger building inside my chest anytime I think about my 2 Q casualties. I don‚Äôt want to match their anger with my own (which likely isn‚Äôt even half.)

803,Class action,"I don't know if this question has been raised before, but I've been thinking a lot about what could possibly be done to stop the Q insanity. I have personally watched it drive people insane. So many others here have as well, and everyone seems to be doing a great job documenting it all. While it would be difficult to go after Q directly, I wonder if it would be possible to shut it down by holding the platforms that host this nonsense responsible through class action lawsuits alleging complicity in the pain and suffering caused by these cult theories? I just feel so helpless, I'm looking for ideas.",QAnonCasualties
804,I have to forgive someone who isn‚Äôt sorry,"My mother isn‚Äôt Q however she believes in lizard people, chemtrails, an antimasker, a the coronavirus is a hoaxer and she says the wifi is killing her..she‚Äôs ‚Äúwi-fried‚Äù. This has been going on for a few years now. It started with pizza gate and the flat earth and has moved through a plethora of conspiracies, now it‚Äôs 5G. Through the years the relationships my mother has had with members of our family have been strained, some are ruined and now everything is in shambles. She claims that they‚Äôre not conspiracies, it‚Äôs the truth and she is a proud truther. She says she can‚Äôt stop, she can‚Äôt un-know what she knows and she is going to figure out the truth of the universe. My mother says it is absolutely possible to know what the creators of the universe know and she has divine wisdom. 
My two younger brothers, dad and I have all tried many different ways to approach the situation. We‚Äôve had family meetings without her to vent and share because she can get very volatile if anything about her beliefs are mentioned. I‚Äôve tried to get her into hobbies to take her away from the iPad, I‚Äôve tried to get her up and moving around to prove that the wifi isn‚Äôt crippling her. We‚Äôve tried to be open and listen hoping she would do the same..absolutely not. We are lost, wrong, uneducated, sheep...she thinks her family members are bots. She calls us bots now. 
The weight of the abundant knowledge that she has been retaining is stressing her out to the point of alcoholism. She was an alcoholic 15-20 years ago, stopped for that period of time and now she‚Äôs back on the sauce. A mean, angry, spiteful drunk because she doesn‚Äôt understand why her family has ‚Äúdone this to her‚Äù we won‚Äôt join her side. She‚Äôs consumed with doom and negativity, pointing that out to her is useless. Rationalizing is useless, logic is futile. Shes  quick to say ‚Äúno no, thats fear porn I don‚Äôt look at that fear porn‚Äù...as she drinks and cries because she‚Äôs so scared, depressed and stressed out from all the horrible things she knows now. The worst part is during these drunken meltdowns she says how much staying away from the internet would change her life and she knows she needs to stop and she can‚Äôt and she won‚Äôt try. 
Last year we didn‚Äôt talk or see each other for 7 months. I wrote her a very long letter opening up to her about everything..begging to have my mom back. We all want our mom. She passed my house on the way home from work every day for those 7 months and never cared to try to mend things. I‚Äôm tired of being the parent. I have to take over her roll for both of my younger brothers as well. I needed a break for my own sanity. Then the holidays rolled around and things sort of were okay so we started speaking again and I felt that I could try to start going to my parents house again. I definitely felt that it was too soon for me as my mother hadn‚Äôt changed much and didn‚Äôt seem to really be phased all that much by me disappearing for half a year. She‚Äôs the type to just repress, bury and not deal with anything at all and just hope a peaceful dinner will cute everything that ever happened, while she continues to act however she wants and knowingly hurt the people close to her. She knows because we tell her and it really doesn‚Äôt matter to her she‚Äôs the victim of the 5G and a victim of all of us. This woman went as far as to visit 4 different doctors to prove that the 5G radiation is why she‚Äôs so tired, can‚Äôt sleep, moody, nauseous and just actually killing her. When a handful of tests all came back normal she was just then validated that it is indeed the Wifi and every doctor is an idiot that is corrupt and can‚Äôt be trusted ma she definitely and absolutely knows more than all doctors. It has nothing at all to do with her immobile, isolated, anxious, drunk tumble down this internet rabbit hole. Our family doctor refuses to see her anymore. 
Today she told me that she isn‚Äôt going to change and I need to stop being judgmental and negative. She doesn‚Äôt need help, I need to stop living in the past and accept her. She‚Äôs busy solving this mystery. 
When she said ‚ÄúI put the truth before my family‚Äù my heart broke....I realize that I really do need to keep my distance from her for my own sake and the guilt is tremendous. The frustration and the bewilderment that overcomes me in regards to this situation are so fucking unhealthy for me, my siblings and my poor dad who has to live with her. I can‚Äôt live with the anger the hurt that manifests itself as hate..I can‚Äôt live with the resentment. I have to forgive my mother even though she isn‚Äôt sorry in the slightest. I have to forgive my mother even though she claims she won‚Äôt change. I need to forgive my mother for the hypocrisy and for tearing my family apart without a care. So how?",QAnonCasualties
805,Did any of your Q people start out following Anonymous?,"Hi, this is my first post. Sorry in advance I'm not the best at delivering my thoughts effectively. But reading though so many stories I just questioned the possible correlation between Q and other groups.

I have some people I know who went down the Q rabbit hole and normally I'm very open minded but upon being sent youtube documentaries about the cabal. I immediately shut it down. They tried to pull the agree to disagree. I said no there is no agree to disagree on this one. I won't even entertain it. 
On the flip side I would have anonymous content sent to me and I would say yeah that's wild but who knows. 

Both have different fundamentals but I feel Qanon copied Anonymous and when Anonymous went MIA Q took the opportunity to sway opinions to deeper conspiracies. I'm just trying to figure out how Q acquired such a huge global following so quickly. Was it partly due to copying other groups. And is it possible that those groups may be able to bring some people back to a place of normalcy? 

Q has destroyed so many lives, there are people who are just followers and they need something or someone to follow, maybe a solution is giving them another cause to follow?

809,Today's impeachment acquittal has only made things far worse,"Trump was acquitted today. This was, for the most part, expected because of the numbers needed to convict versus Republicans who would still support Trump. Even though this was an expected outcome, they are using it as proof that their conspiracies are real and my Q friend is now doubling down more than ever. My hope was that after March 4th came and went, maybe she would eventually wake up to reality. But now, I know for sure that when March 4th doesn't bring about her expected outcome, she'll continue to move the goal post. 
I keep hoping that with each failed ""prediction"" she would eventually feel stupid and common sense will kick in but today's hearing has undo any progress toward that end.

810,Chinese QAnon / Miles Guo,"I‚Äôm worried for my mom. She‚Äôs always been incredibly intelligent and resourceful, and I love her so much but I fear that she‚Äôs going down the rabbit hole of QAnon-type conspiracy theories. She follows Miles Guo, who fled from China and promotes anti-CCP conspiracy theories and QAnon on his platform. I think there‚Äôs good reason to believe that CCP does some pretty messed up things but she‚Äôs convinced that the virus was created by the CCP as an attack on Americans, and that mainstream media takes money from the CCP and is covering up the news from the whistleblower. Her logic ‚Äî what reason is there for the whistleblower to risk her life and lie? 

To be honest, she‚Äôs completely fine if we avoid topics like covid and politics, and it hasn‚Äôt been as bad as some other stories I‚Äôve seen here, but I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do to help her see the light. ESPECIALLY because all the info she consumes is in Chinese and (1) my Chinese sucks and (2) most Chinese news outlets are either CCP propaganda or anti-CCP propaganda, from what I understand. There‚Äôs no way for me to present her with facts to prove her wrong. 

Does anyone else have similar experiences with Chinese parents? And if anyone could offer advice on how I can help my mom while she‚Äôs still not completely gone for good? It‚Äôs so easy to just ignore that side of her but I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôll consume her a few years down the line.",QAnonCasualties

We‚Äôve all seen the difference between a conservative and ... this... in the span of 5 years. Yeah, they were conservative before the big orange asshole, but I‚Äôm like at least I didn‚Äôt have to grieve them twice. 

There were years I didn‚Äôt talk to my grandparents. My abusive ex fed the paranoia that my family hated me and I could only be safe with him. I was fresh out of high school and I was a walking contradiction of all the right wing christian bullshit that I was force fed all my life.

It sucks, but it‚Äôs like the only positive out of all this mental terrorism caused by Q-spiracies, is that I‚Äôve already lost my grandparents and I can‚Äôt lose them again. 

(On a side note, sometimes my grandparents visit me in my dreams and they never mention religion, politics, all the things that they were fervent about in life. The first time it happened we were standing in the clouds and I kept asking if god was real, if any of it was real, and all kinds of things and all my grandma kept telling me was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all going to be okay,‚Äù over and over again. It‚Äôs refreshing, and they always come when I need their help without mentioning a damn thing about politics or god or any of it.)",QAnonCasualties
813,From the other side?,"First, allow me to establish that I probably am more right-leaning than anything else but I am not very interested in politics. I got out of my ""gung-ho giving a shit phase"" five or six years ago. I moved on from giving a shit about the day-to-day happenings within that ~~swamp~~ toxic waste dump which we know the District of Columbia.


There was a time where I'd be sitting there with some friends watching SNL when a skit would come on. They would say some shit about a political pundit/commentator who was on ""my side"" and would instantly feel that fight or flight response. Hell, one time I saw a TYT logo on my friend's computer screen and I felt that sensation...

Heart-rate goes up, and I would just feel the bad kind of butterflies my tummy. **In a way, it felt like I was physically sick** and I guess this would be a called a physiological response. Well anyway, I took notice of it and over the course of a year or so I worked to be conscious about my feelings and responses to various things. 

These days I'm very comfortable hearing disagreeable political views without feeling any kind of way, no matter how sorely misinformed the person speaking is. Heck, sometimes they have a good point.... Anyway, I'll spare you the whining about how the media never seemed to give DT a break. He can fend for himself, he doesn't need my help, money, or kind words. This is not to say that I didn't think the media coverage wasn't very slanted, I just can't be a fare judge since I avoid the corporate media like the plague. 

&amp;nbsp;



**Enter the ""Q"" or ""Q-Anon"" movement** (some of them will correct you if you say ""Q-Anon""... lol)


Within a week of election day, I was in agreement with a friend who said that Biden has it because ""you can't recount burned ballots."" Perhaps this is a wild conspiracy theory. I'm not gonna try to convince anyone. What annoys me is, the amount of people who went along with the Q delusion.


There was a chance for Trump's side to be heard fairly on the 6th but due to the events I wont go into detail on, that didn't pan out. Then the Q-crowd continued ""Trump is going to"" or ""Trump has already declared martial law... they are now going to put the fraudsters on trial and hold a new election.""


As we got closer to the 20th, the ringleaders of the Q-crowd knew they were full of shit, so they began to back-peddle and update their narrative. 

On a positive note, I was in a ""stop the steal"" chat group. In the beginning, I was being called a ""Debbie downer"" by someone who kept posting various pipe-dreams. Towards the middle of January, this same person was sounding just like me...... and others in the group were whining that he was being too negative. The person meant well, saw the error in the dis-info they were consuming and revised their beliefs. This gave me a little bit of hope for others.


&amp;nbsp;

Then some weeks back my dad got off the phone with his brother and told me about some BS video that his brother told him to watch. So we both watched it. It was some fat British guy making shit up. Saying shit like ""Biden isn't the real president. He's currently at TV studio version of the Oval Office and Trump walked past the window and waved.""

Like what?

In recent weeks my uncle has revised his.. beliefs. I offered to bet 5 ounces of silver, but he didn't seem interested (I wanted to win an easy bet). 

He basically has a very fluid outlook on things to come. He's not committed to a specific date which means I can't give him a hard time when March 4th comes and passes uneventfully.


&amp;nbsp;


I kinda stopped taking notes and following this Q shit because you can't throw it back in their faces anyway.... they'll just adopt new bullshit when last week's bullshit doesn't pan out. I occasionally leave disagreeable comments on videos but am finding laughing less and less.

815,My qmom sent me a disgraced doctors ‚Äúletter to friends and patients on why I‚Äôm not getting the vaccine‚Äù.,"For anyone else is dealing with this letter that‚Äôs going around from a Dr. Shallenberger I wanted to share some details that may help you defend against the nonsense contained in his ‚Äúletter to friends and family‚Äù. 
I received this copy and pasted letter from my Mom after casually asking her if she was open to the vaccine. The letter was full of misinformation and misconstrued facts and selective excerpts from news articles. 
I researched who this Dr. was and to my (not) surprise I find that in the early 90‚Äôs he was subject to multiple disciplinary actions due to ""gross incompetence,"" ""repeated acts of gross negligence,"" and ""acts of dishonesty and corruption which are substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a physician and surgeon.""  
He surrendered his medical license in CA due to this and now practices in NV. 
This alone should be enough to show someone that perhaps they shouldn‚Äôt trust this source of information. Not to mention his letter is easily disproved by multiple reputable news sources. 

I asked my mom, ‚Äúwould you go to this discredited doctor and let him perform surgery on you?? If the answer is no, then please also don‚Äôt spread or use his information.‚Äù

816,"I can hear my Q and quasi-Q family already telling me to accept the results of this acquittal and move on, like I told them to accept the results of Trump's election challenging court cases and move on","I'm not going to talk to my Q family members, they're long gone, but I do talk to my ""quasi-Q"" family about politics sometimes. They believe some of it, not all of it: think that Jan 6 was a disgrace and don't buy into the pedophile thing but they believe that the election was HIGHLY questionable, if not outright stolen, Trump is not great but still better than anyone else, and they'll probably still vote Republican. It's extremely frustrating because they're reasonable on some things, and we can have actual conversations sometimes, but then it's like I hit a brick wall talking to them and can't get any further.

820,Help me build my argument/ talking points.,"I've trying think of a clear and easy way to help people understand what Qanon is doing. The first part goes like this:

When a magician does a magic trick they want you to look at one hand while the other hand is actually performing the trick.

Part two:
Qanon started on 4chan. 4chan was(maybe still is I don't know) a place were people would share CP. Qanon saying other people are pedophiles, they are trying to distract you from the truth that those members of Qanon are the real pedos.

Anyways feel free to critique my argument.",QAnonCasualties
821,Why I believe Qanon isn't going anywhere.,"I don't believe Qanon is going anywhere for the simple fact that people are using it to justify their views, prejudices, and warped beliefs they more than likely previously harbored before Q. I used to think it was stupidity and gullibility that was the driving factor of people flocking to Qanon, but I don't think that's  really the case anymore. These people are obsessed with believing in this satanic child killing enemy and throw out all logic and reason, and I think ultimately they really don't care if it's true or not, they literally chose the worst kind of evil imaginable and project it on anyone who has a different view from them, they no longer even have to entertain opposing viewpoints because well, they're literally evil. To them Qanon proves their ideology right, and it must feel good to know youre beliefs are right. 

My aunt who believes, was always subtly racist, now that she's found Q, she can openly hate BLM loud and proud all she wants now cuz to her its really a shill organized by satanic baby killers to destroy America, she no longer has to doubt that maybe she's the one in the wrong or even listen to what they are saying, 'beacuse its evil', and if it's evil she knows shes right. she gets to keep her slanted views about minorities guilt free, and her world still fits neatly in a box of her right and them wrong. Why is Qanon ripe with racism, antisemitism, transphobia, etc? Because its a means to justify those beliefs.
 
It's much easier to hate someone or be a completely terrible person to ppl if you believe they are child rapists secretly destroying america, or if they would support and/or are supported by child rapists. Thats why they obsess over it, it's not about saving kids, it's about everyone else being wrong/evil. Everything is still just black and white that way.

Not only all that, but they get to live in a fantasy world where they can easily champion themselves as the saviors of children and sex trafficking victims, nevermind they dont actually do anything to help anyone, to them they are actual patriots fighting God's fight, they're the good guys and the ""libruls"" are brainwashed by Satan himself, imagine how morally justified they must feel over everyone else, it's the biggest ego trip I can imagine.

No longer are other ideologies and beliefs subjectively evil to them, but they are truly evil and they have ""proof"" of it now. Anything their opponents do that the Qanon members don't like they now 'know' it's because they have evil alterior motives. It's a shield they can put up anytime to deflect anything they don't agree with. That's why it's not going away even after all their set backs, because they don't want it to go away wether its true or not. The ppl in your life who are obsessed with Q, are not obsessed just because they are gullible, factual truth and evidence aren't what they are looking for, because the truth is Qanon is the waters that vindicate whatever beliefs they previously held, and that is one hell of a drug.",QAnonCasualties

Hello! My name is Michael Zull and I am a graduate student in the Arizona State University MS, Technical Communication program.

I have read many of the detailed emotional stories on this subreddit. I am truly moved by the support found here and grateful that this subreddit exists as a place that those effected by QAnon can share their experiences. 

I am conducting research studies on the impact that QAnon has had on relationships and the social and mental health impacts that the QAnon movement has had people's lives. If you are a friend, coworker, intimate partner, or family member that has had a negatively impacted relationship due to differing beliefs and support of the QAnon movement, I'd greatly appreciate if you could take a few minutes to complete a short survey to describe your experience. 

[QAnon Relationship &amp; Social Impact Survey @ Qualtrix](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3m8qf25ha41PDa6)

The survey starts with 5 demographic questions about the QAnon supporter in your life, and then 10 questions regarding the relationship, social, and mental health impact that the QAnon movement has had on you and the QAnon supporter. It should take you no more than 10 minutes to complete. The survey is anonymous, and all information is completely confidential as no identifying information is ever requested.

This survey is one small part of a much larger study that I plan on conducting about this same topic. I thank you in advance for your time and contribution to my research!

826,QAnon is just Icing on My Mother's Cake of Crazy,"My mom has been radicalized for years now. My mother is a well educated black woman and I used to look up to her. When I was going from middle school to high school (I just turned 24) is when it all began. Videos showing men on corners shouting at people how sinful they were (Hebrew Israelites). She started staying up all night watching them. At first it was a dogmatic allegiance to Christianity then it shifted to allegiance to the bible. Now it's morphed into an incomprehensible mess of religion, thinly veiled Islamaphobia/anti-semitism, and of course a never-ending repetition of QAnon/QAnon adjacent conspiracy theories and black supremacy. Yes. You read that right. Black-supremacy. 

When I got into highschool our dynamic changed. I started resenting her. And not in a teenage ""she took my phone"" kind of way. In a ""my mother believes there is a race war coming and that white people will be enslaved"" kind of way. By time I had finished highschool our relationship was in shambles. November 2015, the same year I graduated high school, when Trump was elected she said he had saved the country from Hillary who was a closet lesbian, pedophile-cannibal who raped young girls then ate them, among other things. I've gotten progressively leftist in my views and my mother has fallen deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. 

I see a lot of people talking about experiences I know well. That shift from someone you love turning into someone you no longer recognize. My mother was never perfect. Emotional and physical abuse was always there on some level. But I never questioned if my mother was proud of me or if she loved me as a young child. And today, I don't question it either. Because I know she doesn't. Because she's made it clear she's repulsed by my ""lifestyle"" and I'm ""brainwashed."" I'll never forget the day she looked in my eyes and told me ""Don't ever wonder if I like you, I don't like you. I hate your personality."" I was maybe 18 when she said that. And I replay that in my mind to this day.

I'm getting married soon and I haven't told her about it yet. I don't intend to. I'm marrying a white trans person. I have no doubt she would highjack the whole thing, curse me out, and try to talk me out of it. ""Inferior blood"" and ""gender confusion demons"" became part of her regular vocabulary early on in the indoctrination. I don't tell her where I live. I don't see her anymore. She calls and talks in a one-sided conversation, where my role is to just say ""uh huh,"" otherwise I risk a fight with her. I don't tell her I'm in love or succeeding in organizations I've founded at my university. When holidays roll around I send her the obligatory text ""Merry Christmas!"" and she responds in kind.  I don't tell her about the friends I have or the traumas I've endured. When I had to deal with being sexually assaulted one of the first things I thought was, ""I can never tell her."" Because she went out of her way to tell me if I didn't stay within her religious protections I'd be assaulted. I don't know which would be worse: her taking it as confirmation to everything she believes and driving her that much deeper into conspiracy or her telling me it was my fault. I'm sure both would happen. I just... don't tell her about my life.

828,Religious Q,"It's been a gradual 5 years of change with my family member. It was a quiet change at first but as time went by, they became emboldened and their messages were blatant. It wasn't til last year I realized they were balls deep in this crap when they publicly posted how Kobe Bryant's death was an illuminati blood sacrifice. They now believe they are prophets predicting end times, BLM and Tom Brady's wife are satanic witches and the world is going to end. They've ostracized family members who helped raise their children because they don't share the same political/religious opinions (unless they want money) and have become unbearably judgemental, homophobic and pious. I think they know what they're doing is wrong as they dirty delete their dog whistling 'divine words of wisdom.' They've been on a raging anti-abortion stint for the longest (like shaming an elderly relative for having one despite being raped at 11 yrs old). The focus now seems to be turning to anti- environmentalism? I don't know, it's so fucking stupid and pretty enraging.

It's been sad to witness and difficult to accept this is who they are now...or maybe they've always been these raging assholes all along. This Q shit is so insidious but it's nice to know I'm not alone in dealing with this garbage.",QAnonCasualties
829,Thinking about the future wave of elderly Q people who isolated themselves out if hatred,"It saddens me to think of all these parents and grandparents who have often intentionally severed their relationships with their kids &amp; grandkids. These Q folk may be healthy and self sufficient now, but when the time comes and they are unable to care for themselves they will be left struggling? Will they suffer alone still drowning in hate? Will they demand help from those they still ostracize? Will any of them self-reflect enough to realize they engineered their own hell? 

I've often observed that as people age they tend to either harden and become more hateful and rigid, or soften and become less judgmental and more loving. Q seems to have hastened the process for a great many. The people I've seen that hardened most also seemed to live the shortest (hate brings stress upon the body=stress is a killer), or the longest--like making it to 95-100+. It's like the universe keeps giving them another chance to have that ""come to Jesus"" moment and they keep failing year after year. 

I know it's morbid, but I live my life looking from the imagined end to the present. When I go, I want to know I spent my time being loving and kind above all. I just can't imagine going decades full of hate. I'm not a Christian, but I imagine these people dying, meeting their Jesus and feeling swells of pride and self-congratulatory smugness only to be told: ""uh, yeah.

Why should my dad be so obsessed with Trump when he doesn't even live in the US? He has no connection to America whatsoever but states that Trump is some kind of ""religious saviour"" who is going to save us all.

835,Worried about my parents,"I want to start by expressing how relieved I am to have found this group but also sad how many of us have to resort to coming here to navigate this strange experience. 

Growing up my dad was a source of dysfunction in the household. He was addicted to opiates and a hard labor worker- coming home in terrible moods, I have many memories of my parents fighting or me being afraid of my dad. As a result I don‚Äôt have a lot of memories in my childhood due to dissociation. In my tween-teen years it became the worst. My parents would always have a cluttered house, unopened mail on the counters and whatnot, expect us to clean up their mess everyday after school, and when we didn‚Äôt (because what kid knows how to sort their parents unopened bills and mail?) and yell at us for not doing it. They never picked up their own mess and just expected us to do it growing up. My dad would also regularly use the n word, one time I was about 13 put on a pair of jeans and he said I had a n* ass. Always calling people the n word in his stories and he would even call me it like what‚Äôs up n-?? I am a young white woman and he is also white. I had to unlearn a lot of racist crap that I thought was okay after I moved out.

Bringing me to Q. When Trump won the election in 2016 I knew my parents were happy about it, my dad got a trump train sticker and a flag. Over the year I noticed he would play YouTube videos constantly, throughout the night and all day when he wasn‚Äôt working. Watching Fox News constantly. My sister and I always made it clear we don‚Äôt agree and when he talks about this, or anything that he feels he‚Äôs right about, he raises his voice and shuts us down, which is extremely triggering from our childhood with him. We are not able to engage in conversation with him about this.

All the while his Facebook is full of Q videos. His Facebook posts would say things like ‚Äúdrain the swamp‚Äù or he would end a lot of his posts with just ‚ÄúQ.‚Äù

Text my sister and I to stock up on necessities for shut downs that never happened. 

Before 1-6 he was posting in support of protesting the election. I don‚Äôt think he supports the violence that happened.

After the insurrection I stopped over and almost made it through the morning without bringing it up. He started talking about Facebook and YouTube censoring conservatives and I had already told him I didn‚Äôt want to talk about this with him. Trying to set my boundary. And this developed into him raising his voice about me being ‚ÄúLIED to‚Äù by democrats. He was crying (he does not blubber and cry over things easily) over DT being impeached, about the news portraying him and his supporters as terrorists, the look in his eyes completely broke me. I felt like the parent looking into my crying child‚Äôs eyes. It was horrible. I told him I‚Äôm not going to sit here and get yelled at when I told you I don‚Äôt want to talk about this. He stopped and agreed he shouldn‚Äôt be yelling.

He has deleted his Facebook, YouTube, and just shut down the family Netflix account to disassociate himself from companies that have denounced DT. My dad was already a paranoid, self isolating person before this and now I‚Äôm worried he is losing his sense of identity, isolating himself from the outside world and is probably on some conservative only feed. 

My poor mom just goes with whatever he does. They also don‚Äôt really make any effort to see us, hang out with us, they just care about their crappy jobs and politics. 

I‚Äôm afraid my dad will never swallow his pride and admit that this is way too much. He prefers this over a real, normal life.

836,Political ignorance and social apoliticalism enables Qperson abuse that rips relationships apart,"I want to preface this by saying that the way your Qperson is treating you is not your fault. Their destructive and self-sabotaging beliefs and actions are not your fault. It is who they are and you are not responsible for these inclinations.

I have seen a trend in the posts here, a pattern of ""when we aren't talking about politics everything is fine."" This makes me think of toxic, manipulative and abusive relationships where the victim cannot be convinced they're in an abusive relationship and keeps returning. We warn young people that their inexperience and naivete can lend them in an abusive relationship. I see this happening with the victims in this sub, where despite their (ostensibly liberal) personal beliefs, they opt for a socially apolitical lifestyle and end up in relationships with people whose political beliefs are wildly incompatible with theirs.

""When we aren't talking about politics everything is fine"" is the Qanon equivalent of abuse victims trying to convince others that ""when I don't upset him he's such a sweetheart"" or ""he loves me, really, so it must be my fault I upset him."" The only solution is to educate yourself on political matters and have those discussions. Vet the people you interact with and form relationships with. 

Their ideologies and behavior are not your fault, but please, please don't set yourself up for heartbreak by ignoring the importance of matching ideology in a relationship. You've seen how little it takes to push a Qperson over the edge into full blown conspiracy cult delusion.

I apologize for the ramble, as I am not a scholar on the matter, but it's a pattern I've noticed that I felt was relevant enough to point out. Social apoliticalism and political ignorance lead to much of the suffering Qanon inflicted on the people purely by enabling it to grow unchecked.",QAnonCasualties
837,Unpopular Opinion (Maybe?),"Disclaimer: grandparents have gone off the Q/religion deep end since elections. Other extended family is divided because of political beliefs.

Maybe this is just me, but I think that differring opinions are good for you. I am seeing a lot of people on here (and everywhere else) labeling entire groups of people because of the behavior of some, and I don't think that's the right way to go because then you're just doing the same thing these Q people are doing. 

I have many friends/relatives on the left, center, and right of US politics. I never judge them for their beliefs, nor do I judge my family for theirs. HOWEVER, I do think that *behavior* (whether rooted in politics or religion) is the biggest role in breakdown of relationships. For example, my grandparents think I don't want to talk politics with them because I'm ""becoming brainwashed by MSM"". I don't have time to watch the news, nor am I unaware of biases within them. I don't want to talk with them because of their extremely aggressive (and quite frankly, childish) *behavior*. They have essentially cut off anyone who doesn't go with their theories and spend all day on Facebook (which is now an echo chamber since they unfriend anyone who disagrees). Disagreement is healthy when you can be civil, no matter how ridiculous something (non-violent) may seem to you. This idea that ""If you aren't on my side, then you're bad and I hate you"" has gone way out of hand and it's isolating or alienating many people. I think we all (assuming the majority is sane) have beliefs in common, no one is 'better' than another person for their personal perspectives.

Maybe we should stop judging and labeling each others' opinions and politics and just judge people by their behaviors. I refuse to let opinions/politics/religion become my main course of judgement and as a result, I am exposed to a wide variety of different people, cultures, beliefs, etc.. Exposure is what helps us understand each other. I don't really know why we all have to resort to moving somewhere ""because it's blue/red"" or believing that one place is good because its isolated from blue/red .

That's just really my opinion. I wish more of us could be civil and focus more on similarities than differences, although I do understand why many feel the need to get away from people who cannot do so. My mom, who I moved away from, frequently berated me and wished death on me because of my political views (she wanted to use my vote for her candidate, I refused). My dad and his family were just racist and intolerant towards me (he is a naturalized Korean, and I am first gen half American half Korean). None of them ever called me by my name but instead a Korean slur for ""half-breed"" or ""mongerel"". I don't have any contact with either of my parents because of their radical behavior (and many other reasons). Like I said, I will respect your beliefs, but the respect has to go both ways. Giving ultimatums and freaking out about someone's opinion is really just nuts to me at this point. I read a lot of posts on here that I can unfortunately relate to, and I genuinely hope that all of you find peace in your life, whether that means going no contact, distancing, or apologizing if you have done the same thing a Q person did to you.

I had liberal social views that drove my voting but I didn‚Äôt really read about it past specific social issues. So at the time, I didn‚Äôt care if we had different politics. It had never been a big issue before for me to be different in politics than someone else unless they were ultra social conservatives (of which he was not). 

I didn‚Äôt really pay much attention to the primaries. I watched a debate here and there and rolled my eyes as I watched a reality tv star running for nomination. Like many people, I never took him seriously. I thought people would vote for Kasich because he seemed like the only adult in the room. I guess that shows how ignorant and naive I was then. We ended up moving in together 6 months before the RNC nomination convention in the summer.

When Trump got nominated, he started rooting for him. He was one of the ‚Äúhe won‚Äôt be the same when he gets into office, he‚Äôs just doing it for show‚Äù and ‚ÄúI just want to shake things up in Washington‚Äù. We debated hotly the whole rest of the election and when Trump won, I cried. I cried because my (at the time) boyfriend didn‚Äôt see why I was so upset that this guy got elected. 

For months following, I obsessively followed Trump on Twitter, trying to show my husband that he wasn‚Äôt changing even though he won. He said ‚Äúoh the game is still on, wait until after he gets inaugurated‚Äù. So I waited and hoped. He still didn‚Äôt change as we all know.

So we fought at each other‚Äôs throats for the next two solid years after that. It was the only thing we would ever fight about was politics. Everything else in our relationship was actually great. Our day could be going great and then current events would cut in and it would dissolve into a nasty fight. We couldn‚Äôt ever seem to have a discussion because I was so passionate about the issues brought up (think kids in cages, Kavanaugh hearing, etc) that I would see red. Each awful thing Trump said or did or caused was explained away somehow or whatabouted. I logged onto T_D every day just to lurk and see what they were feeding my husband. I still get on TheDonald.win which is now Patriots.win occasionally so I can know what frame of mind my husband might be in. 

Finally, we both realized that the subject of politics was destroying our relationship so we both finally stopped talking about politics. I deleted all of my social media so I could just stay away from the news and only check it once every couple months. Our relationship improved leaps and bounds over then2 years after that. We got married, bought a house and added twins to our family. 

But now I‚Äôve been drawn back into the daily grind of politics and the fresh realization that my husband still visits Patriots.win. That my husband thinks the election is stolen, that my husband actually tried to brush off the murder of a capital officer by saying he died from an embolism. That my husband has ‚Äújoked‚Äù about pedophile rings between top Democrats and celebrities. 

He‚Äôs not as far gone as some, at least when it comes to some of the much deeper Q conspiracies. He doesn‚Äôt bring up his Trump politics, he‚Äôs never worn or purchased MAGA merchandise, there‚Äôs never been a Trump sign in our yard. In fact, meeting him you would never guess in a million years that he supports the same guy that the people who stormed the capital support. He‚Äôs an amazing dad and really a great husband to me. I tell myself often that I should really just be lucky that the only problem in our marriage is politics but other times, I wish above all else that I could have the amazing marriage without the stain of Trump/Q. When Biden won, many were celebrating on the streets or just at home, crying from happiness and relief. All I could do was stare at the screen numbly, objectively grateful Trump lost but unable to pull up those emotions because my husband thought the win was a fraud. 

So I asked him, if States and Congress certify results and Trumps lawsuits go nowhere, will you finally accept the results of the election? He said yes. But now even though he acknowledges Biden as President, he still thinks the election was stolen from Trump. 

I just want this man (Trump) out of my marriage and I don‚Äôt know how to kick him out. I will keep fighting for my marriage and I do truly believe that I‚Äôm the reason my husband didn‚Äôt fall completely off the deep end but I feel like he‚Äôs hanging on by a ledge and I‚Äôm hanging onto his wrists for dear life.",QAnonCasualties
839,My cousin is changing and it's making me incredibly sad.,"I know this isn't the worst problem to have by any means, but this is genuinely starting to make me sad. My cousin and I are SUPER close; we have basically grown up together, talk all the time, etc. We are now in our early 20s and our friendship, just like many others, has really been tested due to the fucked up year that was 2020. I genuinely still love her, but she has recently started saying some things that really make me question why her opinions are changing so rapidly, and in the exact opposite direction of how she used to think. I totally believe that changing your mind, forming new opinions, etc. is great but some of the things she says have no basis. For example, her boyfriend voted for Trump (she voted independent) and I told her at the very least, that means he is okay with the racist, xenophobic, bigoted things Trump has said. She immediately turned it to Biden, saying he's racist too. I responded by saying that I know Biden isn't a good person, and I'm sure he's racist as well, but because of the messed up two-party system we have, I went with the lesser evil. Then she said, ""Did you know that it was actually Hillary that colluded with Russia in 2016?"" I asked her for a source and said it's literally been proven that the collusion involved Trump and Russia and she went on to say I have to look deeper, not use news stations as sources (which I partially agree with, they are all biased), etc. She still has not sent me anything to prove that the collusion involved Hillary and says she needs to research it for a couple of hours before sending me a credible source. She also says Trump did not incite violence on Jan. 6th. Another example- we were talking and I brought up how double-masking is now being recommended. She said ""No thanks"". She thinks it's weird that NOW the CDC is recommending two masks. I tried to explain that this is due to multiple strains being discovered but it falls on deaf ears. I also tried to explain that obviously what we are told is best to protect ourselves is ever-evolving because there is still so much to learn about COVID, but she just doesn't want to hear it. She says she isn't going to get vaccinated because it doesn't seem safe, but she's been vaping for years (and obviously there's very little research on vaping and its effects) so that somehow makes sense, I guess? I'm getting worried that her boyfriend is influencing her opinions because I know she has been parroting his views more and more. I really don't know what to do, I told her it's concerning to see her going down this path but she says that's not true. Obviously, she's her own person and I love her no matter what, but it's making me so sad to see it happen.",QAnonCasualties
840,The reason why Qanon isn't going away.,"I used to think it was pure stupidity that was the driving factor of people flocking to Qanon, but lately I'm starting to realize it's probable worse. Thse people are obsessed with believing in this satanic child killing enemy that they've concocted, and I think ultimately they really don't care if it's true or not, because the truth is it's just a reason to justify their already shitty behavior and beliefs. Take the Conservative Christian crowd thats flocked to Q, they can now easily think of themselves as champions of saving children and sex trafficking victims now, nevermind they dont actually do anything to help anyone, but to them they are actual patriots fighting God's fight, imagine how even more morally superior they must feel over everyone else, it's the biggest ego trip I can imagine. Even worse than that Qanon is ripe with racism, antisemitism,homophobia, transphobia, etc, it draws those people in like a magnet, even if those views were kept private before Q, they can now use Q to express them and not only be justified but feel honorable in it. My aunt who believes, was always subtly racist, now that she's found Q, she can openly hate BLM loud and proud all she wants now cuz to her its really a shill supported by satanic baby killers, she don't have to listen to their struggle and maybe grow as a person, 'beacuse its evil', and she gets to keep her slanted views about minorities guilt free. It's much easier to hate someone or be a completely shitty person to ppl if you believe they are child rapists secretly destroying america or if they would vote for and support child rapists. Thats why they obsess over it, it's not about saving kids, it's about proving all their previously held fuxked up beliefs were right. Uncle Earl from the trailer park whose spent a life time of stock piling guns and hating the libruls, now has a place to fantasize about murdering them because in thier minds they are no longer subjectively evil, but they are truly evil and they have ""proof"" of it now. Anything their opponents do that the Qanon members don't like they 'know' now it's because they have evil alterior motives. I know a lot of you have family and friends you've lost to Q like I have but, honestly at this point in the game, I don't think the majority of Qanons are just stupidly gullible, or that the majority are just good people trying to save the children, I think the majority of Qanons are probably shitty people justifying their shitty beliefs. That's why it's not going away even after all their set backs, because they don't want it to go away wether its true or not.",QAnonCasualties

845,"My covid denying mum got covid, still denies it.","(The main subject of this post is not Qanon related however it very much links in)
I‚Äôm in the UK, London, born in Poland but this is my home for 15 years now, around 20 for my mum. Me her were never really that close, I moved out as soon as I could at 18/19 and now in my 20s were started trying to re kindle our relationship but it‚Äôs been very tough and slow. A couple months back was one of the first times I feel we had an honest and open conversation as adults about everything, (ideals, morals, beliefs, politics, relationships, race) and all that conversation did was create more divide for me. I realised how differently we think and it honestly scared me. The distance and time between us allowed me to really grow into my own person. In one conversation she told me how: 1) Covid is fake/just flu, government tracking you and all that bullshit, anti mask/ vaccine 2) We spoke about American politics (during the race) and she clearly showed great support for Trump (as much as she tried to hide it and play it off) at the same time accusing Biden of numerous dumb things, mainly the usual pedophilia. 4) Mass consumption of nonsensical media (Facebook) aka. believing anything at face value, never questioning your beliefs and calling someone brain washed if they ever question you 4) Very skewed perception of race and  racist tendencies which I just can‚Äôt tolerate, especially as my girlfriend is half black and it‚Äôs a massive part of her, she‚Äôs passionate about race issues and is an activist. I‚Äôm very proud of her and to be with her. My mum has met her but I‚Äôm now ashamed to put my girlfriend in the same room. These are the main points but overall I see now we just don‚Äôt see eye to eye on many things and at the age I‚Äôm at now I‚Äôve developed strong integrity, there is a lot of subjects in this world I refuse to compromise on, (unless I‚Äôm proven otherwise of course) family or not. WHAT YOU CAME FOR: A month after this conversation I messaged my mum asking how she is and she told me she HAD covid and she now recovered. I warned her about the danger of it and the importance of wearing a mask and how irresponsible she is, so honestly speaking my initial response was basically a ‚ÄòI told you so‚Äô. To which she responded that she had Flus worst than this and it wasn‚Äôt that serious. Stating that Covid is not mortal. She lost me at that point and I wrote her like 5 big essays of the problems I have with her and her beliefs( For another time). The thing that really hurt me the most, is that she was clearly prepared to die before telling me. I could have lost her because of her ignorance and stupid sense of pride. This ignorance plague is actually taking lives and my mum was lucky to get away. That was one of the final if not the final straws for me. Family honestly means nothing to me but blood, I don‚Äôt want an ignorant biggot in my life, no matter what. She‚Äôs very hardheaded and I always felt like conversations with her it‚Äôs just a matter of who ‚Äòwins‚Äô or shouts louder and I never entertain that, I‚Äôll rather stay quiet because if I try speak rationally explain where I stand I‚Äôm laughed at. It‚Äôs not my job to to make her realise this as son, it‚Äôs so draining to listen to and this was only one conversation. I can‚Äôt even imagine what it must feel for you guys out there who have to endure this every day in your homes, and still be strong enough to think logically and not fall into this conspiracy hole. Sorry for venting for so long, I could definitely go on for longer but I just wanted to share my story and I was happy to come here to see others are experiencing the same (equally terrified). This may not have been specifically on the topic of QAnon but I feel this ties in to how people like my mum are so easily influenced by the shit fed to them, often from sources with nothing to back it up and pure speculation and more importantly the impact it had on their loved ones, friends, colleagues. If anyone bothered to read this whole thing I‚Äôd appreciate a few words in the comments to direct my thoughts a bit, as they seem to be all over the place.

Trying to ignore it or hope it was going away didn‚Äôt do the trick. It just got worse over time.  Eventually, it developed a counter/response. Because it had to; and that got very ugly.  Now the fever seems to be breaking.  But there isn‚Äôt any laughing it off and just shaking hands. 

I‚Äôm not looking to repeat the abuse he heaped on everyone and I don‚Äôt want to make family get-togethers awkward. I just really don‚Äôt want anything to do with him anymore. I can‚Äôt see that that will change. I don‚Äôt know if this is hate.  It seems almost beyond that.",QAnonCasualties
847,Q husband,"This is my second post now. Although my husband and I are separated due to Trump, Q and conspiracy beliefs, he still comes round to see me and the kids. He left today after a discussion, not an argument, because I made sure I didn't raise my voice. All I was trying to do was get him to see how he has been putting his beliefs before his family. I know that they expect something big on 4th of March, there's a few things circulating some that think Trump will be inaugurated on that date, others that believe he is still President and Biden has been cloned. My husband believes that Biden didn't really get inaugurated and he is acting in some studio. He also believes the Queen is dead and that her Xmas speech that was televised in the UK was fake. We were supposed to be all going away as a family last weekend but he started his nonsense by text with me during that week so our weekend got cancelled. I let him know today that his son who is 13yrs actually doesn't care if he sees his dad again as he's sick of the way he is upsetting me, so he is now turning that on me, saying I'm trying to poison his kids against him. All I have tried to do is encourage him to see them more, and for all of us to do more but he just can't see this. So again he's walked out instead of apologising to his son for the way he has let these things come first. I'm trying to stay strong now and I have blocked his no. and let him know the kids need an apology and he needs to start putting his family before his beliefs. I'm not holding my breath though.",QAnonCasualties
848,How prevalent is this amoung your Q's,"  

I have a dear friend who I met whilst i was a university student, and he is my ""Q-affected"" friend. For the sake of ease, I'll just call him K. As a student, I used to spend a lot of time in a certain music/dive-bar, and this is where I met K. His family is very blue-collar, while my father was a professor, so we're from very different backgrounds, but we're still good mates. I don't think his home-life was very stable as he was growing up, and he's got very severe ADHD. He takes medication for this, but he also abuses it like hell. He also smokes a lot of pot, and when we were living together a million years ago, he used to take hallucinogens a lot (and I do mean A LOT).

Pocking around the net I've seen anecdotal reports that mixing pot with ADHD meds can trigger psychotic episodes. K's always seemed ""off"" if that doesn't sound too mean. You can tell there's something different about him as soon as you speak to him, but the last few years have been terrible! He's become something else. For a time, he was living quite close to me and his mental health was just spiralling down out of control. He also got me work, for which i was very grateful, but i was stuck with him day in day out. He was always forcing youtube clips under mys nose (some were flat earth, some were really racist in a truly bizarre way, others were about aliens ... they were ALL stupid).

On July 3 2019, K and I caught up for a drink, and to smoke some pot (yes, I know, I'm a fucking idiot!). He was talking to me about some Q-shit involving the bible. Because i did some units at uni to do with comparative religion, philosophy and classical-studies, K's always asking me about this shit. I'm kind of hyper-secular, but I've always been interested in that kind of thing, and so i know about it. He got very animated about me dismissing it, and was saying that how was he supposed to know what it said (we were speaking about Revelations). I said he just read it himself and gave him an old bible. I know with hindsight that this was a stupid thing to do, but it made sense at the time: I was trying to drop the topic, and thought he'd only glance at before throwing it aside when it wasn't what he expected (he'd done that with Gilgamesh two months earlier).

I assume people here are familiar with the whole July 4th 2019 thing, but just in case, that was when JFK Jr was supposed to reveal that he was alive and start the storm. So apparently K went berserk, because he was arrested and put into psych. He has few friends left, so it was me who had to go in and visit him every second day or so and escort him around when he had leave and stuff. It was really full on. His family moved him back to closer to home, so i don't get to see him as much but I've heard he's doing (marginally) better. He still thinks covid is a scam, but he said something about not believing in Q to me a while ago.

The thing is that reading these posts has made me think that maybe my friend isn't as typical as i thought. It sounds as if most of the people here with q-affected friends speak of people less obviously-deluded than K; people who are capable of owning and running a business etc. Now that K's closer to home he can't smoke as much weed as he likes, and they've changed his medication which had him bouncing off of the walls. I'm hoping that with time his brain-chemistry will equalise and he'll be okay again, but I'm not holding my breath. Are other peoples' q-friends drug-affected and/or got overtly-obvious mental health issues?

Also, I feel I'm missing some detail that prehaps i should understand about the whole JFK/Revelations thing? Does anyone understand that? it just seems a little disjointed, like the two don't belong in the same ""theory"".",QAnonCasualties

852,Pregnant and miss my parents. Today I saw them and made peace with estrangement.,"Just want to share the story of my parents, and how I'm at peace with them being out of our lives after seeing them today. 

Cw: sexual abuse. 

They were hippies back in the day. Happy people. I remember 9/11 being the big event that changed them. Made them increasingly suspicious, anti-social, and occasionally bigoted. 

My mom was the one to listen to fringe conspiracy people like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, while my father was Mr. Rational. A very Romney republican. They bickered here and there. I remember them fighting in 2016; my mom loved Trump, and my dad thought he seemed like an asshole. But that didn't last. 

The Trump era really changed everything in our family. They began seeking out more and more fringe content that spun and deflected from valid criticisms of Trump. Dad went from a ""let's give him a chance, he's a cool businessman"" to ""he's literally the savior of American culture!"" Our house became decorated in Trump flags, hats, fridge magnets, and stickers. The TV was never off. Always on Fox, then Newsmax and OAN. It was surreal. 

But last summer, as the 2020 election approached, they both started getting into Q. 

I tried to pull my dad back (he had previously mocked QAnon) but it was like the more I tried to reason with them, the more they clung to it. My dad's boss was holding Q meetings late at night, with people skyping in from across the country. They went shooting in the forest near Canada to ""prepare for civil war"" with a group led by a couple veterans. They invited my husband and I over for movie nights but then played us Q youtube videos. They blew up at us when they found out we were planning to vote for Biden. My mom essentially said, ""How can you vote for a pedophile like him when I was raped by my father as a child?"" 

By the election, I wasn't speaking to them aside from the occasional small talk phone call.  

Then the Capitol attack happened. They were thrilled and I was horrified - by the attack itself but mostly at their joyous response to the violence. As my dad started texting me instructions to ""prepare for martial law"" and stock up on ""emergency food supplies"" I had to cut them off entirely. Distance wasn't cutting it. Unfortunately I did so through text, but I knew a phone call would get me emotional. I essentially told them that their addiction to Q and the violence was shameful, and I didn't want it near myself, my husband, or our new baby. 

Since then, my mom has sent a few emails to podcasts and websites about the ""cabal,"" I assume trying to red pill me. I've ignored them. Got a new phone number too. 

Today we stopped by their house to get the last of my things from their basement. Old paperwork and business suits, that kind of thing. We had called ahead to be sure it was okay, and was curtly told yes. Saw the dog. Saw my old bedroom. Saw them. Most of the Trump paraphernalia was gone. 

But they were so cold. They made no attempt to hug us or smile or... Anything. Resentment was all over their body language.  

And here my dumb ass had been missing them. Wondering if in the last month something had changed or they'd come to their senses. So many times I've wanted to call and give baby updates or ask for advice or just reason with them. 

But there I was, their daughter, 37 weeks pregnant in their kitchen and it was like they didn't care. Like they've chosen Q and Trump over me, and over their granddaughter.

As we drove the hour back to our house, my head was flooded with small memories I'd mostly forgotten - or maybe pushed away. Racist side comments they made when I was a teenager. How, when I was going through puberty at age 11, my mom told me all men will find me sexually appealing and to be careful - even around my father. My dad confiding in me when I was dating my husband that us being together wasn't a good idea because he's Black and society will target us. Them trying to convince me not to move to Japan and then again the UK because they're ""dangerous"" countries full of propaganda, socialists, and terrorists. 

These comments seem so obvious now, but they were sandwiched between their good aspects, their personalities and hobbies. I overlooked them because I could.

I thought far right media and Q had taken my parents from me and brainwashed them. How else could children of post-WW2 immigrants, Jewish and German, believe such anti-semitic, fascist crap? 

But no, they weren't brainwashed. 

Q puts together all the things they wish were true. It gives them justification for the hatred, bigotry, and fear they used to make an effort to conceal. It makes the violence they want to see somehow righteous. 

I miss my dad. I was always a daddy's girl. And I wish my mom were around to help me give birth and be a mom myself. 

But my daughter deserves better grandparents than them. My husband deserves better in-laws. And I need to stop making excuses for their toxicity, hoping they'll change. It's their own responsibility.

And I think I'm finally at peace with letting them go. I have chosen family that have stepped in with love during what should be the happiest time of my life. My childhood best friend's parents are helping us prepare for baby, and my mother in law checks in often and is ready to come help at a moment's notice. We have great friends who have found a way to be present, even during an endless pandemic lockdown. 

If my parents can't be part of that and prefer Q, so be it. I'm done shedding tears over their choices.

She‚Äôs been involved with Q from the beginning.   She is one of these folks that will never let go in fear of how she will look by embedding her self in all of this garbage and doubling down to not be foolish.  (Pretty sure that‚Äôs not working)
I would never point a finger and say I told you so, but we are at a point way past just someone being ignorant.  This appears to be a giant mental health crisis that targets the emotionally vulnerable and gullible.   

I can literally tell stories for many many  hours as I‚Äôm sure all of you can.

My wife is real big on this financial reset aspect of Q anon. I haven‚Äôt seen it mentioned in any of the posts I‚Äôve read and I‚Äôm curious is anybody is familiar with the Nesara Gesara    As I understand it it‚Äôs one of the oldest Ponzi scheme‚Äòs that it tends to attach itself to any crisis of significance going on in our country.  My wife is telling all of her family,  in which most of them are believers, that there‚Äôs going to be a financial reset in which we‚Äôre all going to be loaded. Our money is going to be backed by precious metal again and our checking accounts and assets are going to be revalued which could make them worth 5 to 10 times what they currently are. She has our daughter and son-in-law convinced JFK Junior is alive and is behind this and helping the push.  
She keeps telling them every year to wait till the last minute to file their taxes because the IRS is illegal and going to be going away, the banking system is illegal and going to be going away forever, the media will be gone overnight one day, amongst many other things. 

DJT has signed Nesara Gersara in place and will be activated when the new election inauguration takes place in March. I Can‚Äôt Even!  

In addition there is an inter-Galactic being called Ashtar who he and many other  peaceful aliens are living and walking among us and helping DJT run things. 
She goes to sleep every night listening to Ashtar YouTube videos.   

At this point the Q army believes absolutely anything they are told and I cannot even get my mind around 1% of the garbage they treat as gospel. I imagine in my mind a table full of hackers in Russia or China sitting around drinking beer joking about the next conspiracy they can put online that Q people will attach themselves to. Currently JFK Junior, Elvis Presley, Princess Diana, Michael Jackson are all alive and well. JFK Junior is coming on the scene any day now to expose himself, and his dad too,  who would be well over 100 years old.   This is so cultish. 

I could go on for hours, but I appreciate this forum and honestly is one of the most civilized ones I‚Äôve ever seen on the Internet. I appreciate everyone‚Äôs respect level and courtesy as there are many many hurting people who‚Äôs family, friends, &amp; loved ones are completely enshrouded in this ridiculous movement, with no end in sight.  

Hang in there folks, we‚Äôll get through this together!",QAnonCasualties
855,Nonviolent qAnoners still complicit ?,"Okay, so I was thinking today, let‚Äôs say there are some nonviolent conspiracy theorists/white supremacists (include all types of bigotry here). If they truly believe their conspiracy, then they think democrats have been murdered and are being played by people with masks on/body dupes - that means they are okay with murder?  Are they horrified ?  Who did they notify ?  No one is investigating these murders?  No. Because the QAnoners are complicit.",QAnonCasualties
856,So happy I found this group,"I came across this page because of a Huffpost article about families who‚Äôve been torn apart because of Trump/Qanon. Like so many of the families in the article, my mom had made a complete 360 from the woman I‚Äôd known my whole life. 

My mom died from kidney cancer in May 2020 - a crazy story because she had been in remission for 20 years when it came back in 2016 and more aggressive. When that had happened, she had gone down a rabbit hole trying to find natural ‚Äúcures‚Äù, buying expensive snake oil (what I‚Äôd call it) and there was no changing her mind about sticking to science and what her oncologist recommended. She was convinced chemotherapy was a Big Pharma conspiracy with doctors to make money and have the FDA not approve these so called cures she was finding. I blame her friend that was a huge conspiracy theorist and from there, my mom drank the koolaid. 

When I found out she voted for Trump, I was astounded. I would get so pissed when she‚Äôd talk to this friend on the phone about all the bogus conspiracy theories and regurgitate all the bullshit from Trump. Since she was sick, this should‚Äôve been time to take full advantage of what we had left, but instead I felt our relationship was more strained and weak. I‚Äôm an only child, and she raised me as a single mother, so she‚Äôd been my rock my entire life. 

I would get so irate when I‚Äôd try to find understand why she voted for Trump and one day I told her I‚Äôd lost so much respect for her because of it. She was like a stranger to me and I didn‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Now, I hold a lot of guilt because of what I said and because we weren‚Äôt close before she died. There was a quote in the article from a loved one saying, ‚ÄúI hate Trump because he took my mom away from me.‚Äù And that‚Äôs exactly how I feel. It‚Äôs all so heartbreaking.",QAnonCasualties
857,Feeling like I've lost my mom,"My parents are conservative Christians and have been lifelong Republicans but never really talked about politics much when I was growing up. They both voted for Trump in 2016 but would still talk about how they cringed at some of the things he said. 

Over the past 4 years my mom has grown closer with a friend of hers who is an obsessed Trump supporter--buys his wines, sends my mom Trump bears, etc. My mom never had many close friends as an adult and has completely latched onto this friendship and I think that is part of why she's now obsessed with Trump as well. At the beginning of Covid, my mom was taking the virus seriously but by July she was traveling with this friend to Vegas and acting like it was all a hoax, despite my boyfriend's uncle dying of it a month before. They even went to one of his super spreader rallies and the first Million Moron March in DC. 

Over the past year my moms words and actions have gotten more alarming. She sent me the Plandemic video to watch, blames everything on ANTIFA, believes the election was stolen, said the Nashville Christmas Bombing was to destroy dominion computers stored in the AT&amp;T building, and made comments during the BLM protests that she ""wished someone with a gun would go out and shoot them all"". She also later on told my brother about the power outages theories and a few other bizarre theories that he didn't even want to repeat to me. I got in countless arguments with her over all of this but tried my best to not engage to keep my sanity. We live on opposite sides of the country so it wasn't in my face 24/7.

On January 6th she posted praising the insurrectionists calling them all patriots and that a ""sleeping lion had been awakened"". I deleted her on all social media and told her over text message that I no longer wanted any kind of relationship with her, that she was in a cult, etc. She told me to ""stop drinking the koolaid."" Irony...

A few days later she posted on Facebook saying we need a new civil war and went back in forth with a guy in the comments about how veterans will be on their side, how they all have guns, etc. Since I was no longer FB friends with her, I only found out because multiple people screenshotted it and sent it to me because they were concerned and asked me to report it to the FBI. I don't think she would act on anything violent but at this point I feel like I don't even know this person so I just reported it to be safe. An FBI agent ended up contacting her and talking to her on the day of Biden's inauguration and she lost it. She ended up figuring out it was me that reported her by going onto my email (I didn't know she had the password) and finding my emails with the agent. She told my brother that she knew it was me but has not confronted me yet. She instead keeps doing little things to try to get a rise out of me to start an argument so she can bring it up but I've just been not engaging at all.

I have such a strong feeling of guilt over this because my mom has always been very emotionally manipulative and raised me to be extremely dependent on her. She would get jealous if I had friends in high school, wouldn't let me get summer jobs, always bought me things to hold as leverage in arguments, etc. She didn't talk to my godmother for 10 years because she told her that we needed friends other than our mom. I think it's ultimately a good thing that I'm being forced to be more emotionally independent now but it's really difficult for me since it completely goes against how she raised me and I feel like I can't even talk to her now.

It honestly feels like my mom is dead because I don't recognize her anymore. I don't even know how much of a Qanon follower she is because I have virtually no relationship with her anymore. I know this post is long but it feels good to write it all out and I wonder how much others can relate. It makes me so mad when I think about how many families these lies have destroyed.",QAnonCasualties

859,A long road ahead,"Like many millions of others, I have lost friendships because of Trump and misinformation like QAnon.  Lies hurt and lies destroy relationships.  It affects us all whether you're one of the brainwashed or the observer of a delusional friend or family member. 

How do we recover, as humans, I mean?  How do we reign in the lies and regain the trust we used to have in our institutions?  Why DO people think the main stream news is not to be believed? What makes them think that professional journalists from all over the world are colluding to feed us all untruths?  They've lost trust and they'd rather believe a monster like Donald Trump or the enigma of Q. Once they've made the choice it's difficult bringing them back. 

Whatever we do, we cannot convince them of the truth. We must be patient.  Time is the great healer.

With an adult government back in place we can have more hope but it's a long road ahead, I fear, as the seeds of hate and discontent have been sown in a field of lies.  There's more to come.",QAnonCasualties

Am I ever going to get my best friend back? And if he leaves Q or Q ends and leaves him, what is he going to be? Is he ever going to think logically? Can he think logically anymore? Brains are weird and they don't just bounce back. 
It is like people regress when they get into Q hard core. They lose rational thought, they act immature, not respecting boundaries both personal and social. They lose a lot of self control. Even if Q could magically go away tomorrow, we will have millions of messed up people. How does this just get better?

866,"My Family is Q‚Äôs Judge, Jury, and Executioner","I suppose I should have seen it coming when I announced that I supported the BLM protests last Summer. They verbally abused me for over an hour right then, swore at me constantly, insulted my intelligence, my personality, pretty much everything I was until they left me crying in fetal position on the floor of the kitchen... and then they turned around and said that they had done all of it out of love. 
Because of course you have every right to traumatize your grown son and reduce him to nothing as long as you call it ‚Äúlove‚Äù.
That was a half-year ago. They‚Äôve only gotten worse. My father is constantly soaking up whatever lies Newsmax and OAN leaves for him, yet remains utterly complicit whenever the subject is discussed, hardly ever speaking at all. In that way, he‚Äôs almost playing the neutral party, never approving but never disagreeing either, just going along with every little thing. I‚Äôll label him the judge by that logic.
Corresponding, my mother is the jury: she gets to decide what stays and goes, what‚Äôs real and what isn‚Äôt, what‚Äôs considered truth and what‚Äôs considered blasphemy. She‚Äôs been on a rampage recently. She‚Äôs gutted our extensive family movie collection because she thinks that Hollywood consists of Satanist pedophiles. She‚Äôs broken the family budget and cluttered up our already-too-small house my buying way too much food to stuff into pantries we don‚Äôt need, all in the name of ‚Äúpreparing for the End‚Äù. She‚Äôs driven away every friend of our family we‚Äôve had for several years with her rhetoric. I won‚Äôt even get into what exactly that rhetoric is; you probably already know. 
Finally, my brother is the executioner. He is fully and completely willing to cause harm to defend his Big Lie. He says so constantly. Every chance he gets, he just loves to harp on about how much better America would be if we simply ordered a Nazi Eugenics-like killing of all trans people. Or if we ordered the genocide of all Muslims in this country. Or if we abolished the Democratic Party in favor of a neo-monarchy led by Republicans (which would be fascism, of course, but to him that‚Äôs a good thing). It might be mostly bluster, and he might not be as strong as me, but he does have access to the family gun...
Suffice to say, I‚Äôm planning on escaping to a college campus when the next semester starts in Autumn.

He lives several states away, so we don‚Äôt see him very often, but to our surprise, we got a rant sent to us via text about a month before the election that we were cop-hating, antifa BLM supporters who didn‚Äôt understand that the Proud Boys were saving the country.

868,Broken hearted mom...I've lost my daughter,"I've been going through all of the posts here and I'm somewhat comforted by what I'm reading.  Unfortunately, 90% of the posts are about kids who have lost their parents to Q.  I'm a mother who lost my best friend/daughter.  She and I were like 2 peas in a pod.  We talked every day, got together with our whole family (there are 15 of us) for every birthday, anniversary, graduation and, really any other occasion we could turn into a celebration!   I'm a Democrat.  She became a Republican when she married her husband, who I adore(d).  We NEVER had so much as a disagreement about politics.  It was a ""non-issue.""  At least it was until 2015.  Her change started shortly after Trump announced his run for the presidency.  She started with ""Pizza Gate"", then claimed that Bill and Hillary Clinton had Vince Foster killed, as well as Seth Rich.  It just went downhill from there.  Conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory.  

The last time we actually spoke was in Aug.2020.  We hadn't seen each other for a while, so I called to invite her to Starbucks for coffee.  The first 30 minutes was fine - just small talk.  Then, she brought up Barack Obama who, by the way, she had voted for in 2008.  She mentioned something about his middle name, Hussein, being a Muslim name.  I realized at this point where the conversation was headed.  We had already had ""the birther"" conversation in 2015.  I wasn't going to have it again.  I stopped her &amp; said, ""We're going to have to agree to disagree on this.""  Then I stood up, hugged her, and said, ""We need to set boundaries in the future. I don't play the 'conspiracy theory game. I have to go. I love you. Bye.""  That was pretty much it.  I haven't spoken with her since, although I did hear that she, her husband and 2 teenage kids went to DC on 1-6.  I don't think they went with the intention of getting involved in the violence, but nothing would surprise me.

Some days, the pain is unbearable.  But the uncertainty of where we will end up is the worst.  I want my family back.

869,Dealing with my Spiritual/Wellness Q Sister,"This is going to be relatively mild compared to what a lot of people have experienced, but I appreciate the opportunity to get it off my chest.

I don't want to break any rules about sharing articles, but if you want to google it, it's ""The Unlikely Connection Between Wellness Influencers and the Pro-Trump Rioters"". I didn't realize that my sister was most likely deep in Q or Q-adjacent shenanigans until I read this. She used to be a nurse working in emergency room/trauma centers. She took a swift right turn about a year and a half ago and suddenly was very into the spiritual and wellness community on instagram. Quit her job and moved out to AZ to create videos/posts that promoted her particular brand of feminist-led spiritual health and wellness. Not for me but I like to think I'm supportive. 

In the beginning of the pandemic she made a few posts about not needing to wear masks and how your aura can protect you from covid, a little disappointing to read to be honest. Around August 2020 she announced she was selling her possessions to car-camp full time. Interesting but ok. After some more questions, she announced to the family via group facetime that 1) 5G is for microchips and any covid vaccine will have a microchip in it B) on Nov. 3rd they will shut off phone service and electricity nation-wide and C) there will be a real life purge as the Democrats revolt against DJT's inevitable win. The cherry on top was that she had ""received all this information within a 24-hr period"" and that is ultimately why she feels safer if she were camping out in the woods when all that goes down. 

She has always been very careful to not pick a political side out loud (as a few members of our immediately family are very left-leaning). She has never once said the word ""Qanon"" so I'm not sure if she even realizes where she is getting her info from. I truly don't think she supported DJT, she believed she was just warning us of what was inevitable.

Nov 3rd came and went and yes there was some tension and confusion across the nation, but none of the things she claimed clearly have come to pass. A final prediction she made was to share a video with the family in which a well-known wellness guru (and I guess political commentator) explained how a Real Civil War might still happen because yet again Democrats won't accept DJT's win when the election results finally shake out. We all know who was declared the next Pres and what happened on Jan. 6th and she has been radio silent about politics ever since. She will still occasionally post things to her instagram such as ""just because someone thinks differently than you doesn't mean they are a conspiracy theorist"". But again doesn't claim to be a part of Q and I don't even think she knows the true source of the claims she was spouting. 

I hope she is in the clear as I have not heard anything about March 4th from her and she has returned to a nursing job for the time being. I'm all for finding your niche and sharing it with others but there was a brief and scary pivot into Qanon conspiracy territory that I just hope she has been able to pull herself out of.",QAnonCasualties
870,Are they mentally ill?,"So I'm brand new to this sub and I'm sorry if this has been discussed before. 

I was finally diagnosed and began treatment awhile ago, but I have bipolar disorder as well as obsessive compulsive disorder.

In the early 2000s, I became obsessed with the 9/11 and peak oil conspiracy theories.  I was spent countless hours scouring the internet reading everything I could about the ""truth"", and wouldn't shut up about it whenever I talked with friends and family. My worldview for a period of time had changed drastically,  and I was obsessed, it had drastically taken a toll on my relationships. 

The stories that I've been reading on this sub mirror my own life  from when I was undiagnosed and unmedicated. Is it possible that many of your Q people have serious underlying, undiagnosed mental illnesses and that's one of the main causes of their behaviors and QAnon obsessions?

871,I Do Not Feel Safe Inviting My Mother To My Wedding,"I've heard of this Reddit forum before but since I'm not a very active user on this website I had never checked it out until now. But I feel bad constantly crying on the shoulders of my friends who have their own problems to deal with. So I'm going to post here, mainly to get this off my chest.

I am planning on getting married in May after a decade with my partner, and postponing from 2020 due the pandemic. We are endeavoring to have a safe, socially distant, healthy wedding. I am encouraging everyone who is able to get a vaccine beforehand to do so. (I have pre-existing conditions that allowed me to qualify for the first phase in my state, and have already received my first dose.) Now, I understand that not everyone will be able to get the vaccine by May but I have helped a number of my friends who qualify, and their elderly family members get vaccination appointments over the past couple of months. I'm endeavoring to help at least 80% of my guest list vaccinated before the wedding. This will not be a superspreader event, not on my watch.

Now we come to my mother. She is eligible for the vaccine but she refuses to get it. For years I have watched as her conservative leanings have become more and more extreme. She is fully indoctrinated into QAnon at this point. She is constantly spouting propaganda and conspiracy theories at me and will not listen to a single thing I say. She refuses to get the vaccine, or even consider wearing a mask to protect others. 

Nothing has caused me more pain and stress during wedding planning than my mother. Not the pandemic, not the health concerns, not the fact that we had to postpone and change all of our vendors, not the amount of money we are spending, not the fact that I still don't have a dress, or any of the other things that are reasonably giving me anxiety. 

Because on top of all of this, I've had to deal with numerous texts, messages, and e-mails from my mother over the past several years telling me how I've been ""brainwashed"" by my liberal education (that I went into debt to obtain because she was never willing to help me) or by the media. She seriously thinks that I'm part of a Marxist/Communist agenda trying to take over the country (because I am technically a member of the horrible ""media"" that she hates so much and I'm also very much a leftist). She constantly proclaims that we just ""shouldn't discuss politics""  but takes any excuse to rant at me about her abhorrent alt-right beliefs and how I'm the hateful divisive one, not her. This includes almost every conversation we have had about the wedding. 

For years she has been emotionally abusive, and manipulative. But she still thinks she has the ""right"" to attend my wedding and that I should bow down in submission to her simply because she is my mother. Last year I bent over backwards to secure a (very expensive) new venue with lodging simply so she could stay there on Friday night (she converted to Orthodox Judaism over a decade ago and cannot drive on Saturdays). 

Recently I told her that she could not come to the wedding if she wasn't vaccinated. In some attempt to ""compromise"" she claims that she'll get a Covid test before traveling to Pittsburgh. But even during that exchange, she was hurling abuse and alt-right propaganda at me. Putting me down, rewriting history, making herself into the victim, trying to guilt trip me, gaslight me, and emotionally manipulating me into doing what she wants. I wanted her to be there because she is on my only living parent. But I don't want to risk the lives of my friends and partner's family by having her in attendance. 

I just don't know what to do. I tried to cut off contact with her five years ago after the election and I was a fool to reach back out to her and think that she might ever change. 

I already took her off the guest list after the last hateful rant she sent my way. That was after I tried to give her a chance to condemn the actions of the insurrectionist mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th. But she just doubled down and started spouting rhetoric and propaganda at me once again, belittling me and saying terribly cruel things about who I am as a person, because I'm a ""baby-murdering liberal."" 

Just this week she tried to wheedle her way back into my good graces, but that of course quickly devolved into the same old fight. Nothing I have ever said gets through to her. She doesn't listen to me. She doesn't respect me. There is no regard for my boundaries or my wishes. She claims to love me ""FOREVER"" but what kind of love is this? Her involvement with QAnon is paired with her long history of abusive and manipulative behavior. I have begged her to seek therapy, so she has someone to talk to who might be able to help her understand how much this is hurting her children. But she will  not listen to anything I say. 

Additionally, she does not seem to understand that my issues with her stem from her beliefs and her involvement with QAnon. And that her attitude about the vaccine is only a symptom of a much larger sickness that is living in her head. 

So that was my rant. Thanks for reading, if you took the time to do so. I'm sure there are others here who have similar stories. Any advice would be welcome.",QAnonCasualties
872,Qanon Orphan,"I'm so glad I found this. It's helpful to read the stories and heal on here, if that's even possible rn. Honestly I don't know. I noticed my parents going batshit crazy for the first time roughly a little over 4 years ago. They've always been anti-government and weird, but that alone didn't seem odd at all. As time went on they started telling me things, that even though I had not thoroughly researched the topic, I knew right away something was off. Like normal, smart people, especially the ones I looked up to and was raised by, don't say this bs. I brushed it off for a while and thought, ah mom must have read something weird online NBD. A couple more years went by and I started recalling the monthly predictions and irrational BS they had been spewing for years. I told them their track record at predicting literally anything was terrible. Nothing they had ever been consumed by or warned me about over time had come true. Then along came Q. I learned about it and could go back bs story by bs story over the years verbatim. I was shocked. I could also find the meme or false information going around and predict what they were going to say next. No one was ever held accountable after something they said would happen didn't happen. But don't worry, next month it will, or next fall, or next summer. It's always down the road. The goal post always moves and the cult lives on. I started having conversations with my parents explicitly about the stories they were telling me with a ghost white sincerity in their eye, and showing them how easy it was to debunk. I showed both of them several times step by step how to check multiple sources on anything to prove if it was real or not. I warned them about the places they were getting their information (blogs and YouTube University). I also told them to be careful about everything they saw on FB etc. They just listened and then told me they don't trust Wikipedia or mainstream media. Any of it. So they had successfully dodged my educational debunking seminar. They told me about the Cabal and pedophile rings, specifically ALL of the Democrats and Hollywood Elite and how the President was a ""brave hero"" akin to Jesus/God. President's word was gospel, and really Q. Besides that everything is wrong. I argued for years. I debunked for years. Being raised religiously I shuddered at ""their"" idea of religion considering who they worshipped. It had nothing in common with Christianity or it's principles. I reminded my parents that pedophile rings exist in all organizations around the world in different places at different times and there was no ""secret"" about it. I realized that all the things they had been saying about Democrats over the years that was completely insane came from these memes and Q blogs. I mean, party aside, really crazy shit. I bit my tongue through ""the government is tracking my phone so I have to turn off the gps"" and the ""I use an untraceable browser so they can't see what I look up"" and even the ""Government is controlling the weather/Chemtrails"" phase. Still not sure why the last one was even created, but hey why not. I started avoiding conversations with them. I wanted to salvage what, if anything that was left of our relationship. I sat through the ""5G"" and the ""Microwave poisoning"" and the "" Blue light from technology "" glasses that they wore. I really didn't know what to do. So Covid comes around and naturally like any good Doomsday prepper would do, they informed me that ""Martial Law"" was unavoidable and I had to always have food and water and a full tank of gas and hey, why don't I just come hide where they lived to escape it for a little while. I argued and got verbally abusive, because I knew they were FULL OF SHIT. Being recently unemployed I decided I could go for a little while. I have many other siblings. They were only able to scare one other to come up. So nothing happened. The trip was stressful and my ability to avoid or stay quiet around my parents was becoming impossible. I left. My parents don't believe Covid is real. They are anti-masker anti-vaxxer Qanaons. Even after all of the Medical professionals and immunologists etc share their knowledge. Even after my sister had it and was hospitalized and has long lasting effects because of it. Even after I've had 8 friends lose someone in their family because of it. Even though my dad is or ""was"" a medical prefessional and so are 2 of my siblings. I've lost my mind with this. I had been telling my mom respectfully for 2 years on a weekly basis, ""Do not send me messages or include me in group messages that have anything to do with Politics or conspiracies"" It never worked. I had to block her number. I had to get verbally abusive and yell. I have tried as an adult human being to gently and respectfully explain the TRAUMA that I experience when they spew the Q to me. As a growing older child I am learning how to love myself and reduce toxic relationships. I DO NOT call my parents because of this. I have tried everything. I have tried to talk. My mom turns into a defensive child. She still doesn't even know what the hell is going on. Their behavior has REAL WORLD effects on people, including her children. All of them have distanced themselves. I am the only one taking a stand. I realize I speak from a place of privilege, growing up with both parents, trust me. I said ""goodbye"" to them last year. My mother blames me, thinks I am being too harsh. I've been sober for 15 years, and my mom even tries to compare it to all the shit I put them through with my drug use and years. If this is payback, I'll take it, sure but I have to show tough love. I haven't even been able to tell my parents about my personal life for 2 years. I know I am validated in my actions, for my own protection at this point. I am in survival mode in my personal life. I am alone. I never thought the internet would take my parents from me. I am an orphan. Thank you for your comments and letting me vent. This is the 1st time in the last 4 years I have talked about this.",QAnonCasualties

877,Curious outsider,"I would like to start off saying I do not support trump. I think he‚Äôs overall disgusting, but I‚Äôm a ‚Äòconspiracy theorist‚Äô and that gets cross referenced with trump frequently. 

I am curious, when did you learn about qanon? Do you deny their legitimacy due to their association with trump, or have you always disbelieved what they say? And my final question, would you be able to digest their claims if they ever were proven true?

Anonymous has been around a very long time. Qanon is said to be a far-right conspiracy theory but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs valid to place them ‚Äòright‚Äô or ‚Äòleft‚Äô. 

There is a lot about this virus that doesn‚Äôt add up. People dying from it said it wasn‚Äôt real. Nurses in overflow hospitals say it‚Äôs not as contagious as it‚Äôs promoted to be and there‚Äôs no clear standard of who is and isn‚Äôt vulnerable. Governments have historically done what the conspiracy theorists claim they are currently doing. Pushing for globalization, centralized global government and economy, taking clothes off our backs that we don‚Äôt have to gain foothold in other countries in need, I mean the proof is in the pudding..

The history of how the Holocaust evolved from an election to a genocide corroborates well with what has happened in the past year. Czechoslovakias civil war fits the amount division the media seems to be pushing on us. 

Mind you, conspiracy theorist are not against you. They‚Äôre against people who want to take advantage of our country as a whole. They‚Äôre against a government who has clearly been manipulating us, and the world overall, for centuries. They‚Äôre against the times that our leaders committed genocide (and they have, refer to Native American history). Propaganda is very present in our media, social media, communities, whether your right or left. Black or white, citizen or alien, gay or straight. 

Just think for a second why you don‚Äôt believe the theories. The people who convince you they‚Äôre fake, are the people who have the most to lose if you believe them.

882,Hi! Here on anon account. Wanted to share our family's story.,"
I'm white, female, 40, married with two kids, and a SAHM. My husband and his family are all conspiracy theorists and I've been really lonely for the past four years. I don't have family close by and this was a nightmare for me. 

My husband and I both voted for Obama and were on the same page when we met in 2011. We married in 2012, and were able to talk calmly about politics. 

2016 my husband became a different person. Suddenly he started becoming meaner and more distant and very rigid in his thinking. He stopped helping out with chores and started spending alot of time online. Then he started talking about Q. 

He is a Redditor, and I do blame Reddit for this partly because Reddit is where he got his content. 

Politics became a hot button in our house. He got very angry at being questioned and started a narrative that I had TDS, Trump Distortion Syndrome. Any kind of discussion inevitably led to a fight. He stopped parenting, and became a fun time dad who didn't feel he had any responsibility toward normal things, like homework, dinner, cleaning.... He started groping me at odd times like when I was distracted and kept saying that by withholding my breasts I was alienating him. 

When that was met with distaste on my part, he blew up, and that became his personality. Everything became my fault. His parents moved to Florida? That was my fault. The laundry piling up? Also was my fault. Literally he was able to blame me for almost everything. 

His narrative changed again and suddenly it became his job to keep everyone in line although he himself slept in, didn't cook, didn't clean, didn't help with the kids, and spent all of his time online, only running to talk to me when Q made another drop. Finally, I asked him to stop talking about it and to find something else.... that something else became video games. 

He became a person I didn't know and he still is. I thought that Bidens inauguration would snap him back out of it, but it hasn't. He was absolutely a mess the day of the capital riots and became angry, vengeful, and the emotional abuse kicked up yet another notch. He still believes the capital riots were necessary.

 Finally I had to get his family involved because he refused to go to counseling and was sleeping all day and being awake all night. He started ruining my sleep cycle and I became so exhausted I couldn't mentally or physically function and became a shell of myself. I would try to take naps during the day, and he would sleep until 1 and wake up after the kids were gone to school. I would be trying to rest and he would literally bust open the door turn on the light and demand sex. 

I am now so uncomfortable around him that I avoid him during the day and generally as much as possible.

QAnon, you can have him. I do not want him anymore and our marriage has dissolved into a pile of shit. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 

He realized how abusive he was being and now he has shut down. That's fine with me because I don't want to talk to him anyway. 

I handle the parenting independent of anything he does. I now have taken on his chores and my own and there are no thank yous. None are expected. He's allowed to live his life on his own terms because now none of his bullshit makes an ounce of difference to the day to day living of our family. He can read his theories all day and that is his new life. 

The only thing he has successfully kept going is his job. If he loses that, I'm taking the kids and leaving him. 

Hopefully QAnon will let him keep that at least.",QAnonCasualties
883,"Class Action Lawsuit Against Trump, Fox, OAN, Newsmax, etc. for loss of life, loss of lifestyle, duress and loss of familial affection","Kidding, not kidding.  Totally new to reddit, just reaching for a support group over the alienation and isolation I've felt more and more since Trump's inauguration and much more so since the pandemic began.

I've always been close with my mom.  She and I have always debated politics.  Though we disagreed on policy, you could call politics one of our go-to subjects.  That began feeling less rewarding and/or engaging when Trump won in 2016, but has become intolerable since 2020!  

We live in two totally different realities.  There is nothing I can say that she doesn't brush off as my being brainwashed by ""MSM"" (main stream media).  There is no proof I can provide her that she doesn't deflect as coming from a lying, deep state, or otherwise compromised source--this happens regardless of providing her news articles or primary sources (government reports/data, transcripts, etc).

She spends her time consuming alternative media, giving her alternative facts, creating an alternative reality!

While we used to speak almost daily--hours throughout the week--I've talked to her 2-3 times in 2021.  Not at all since the inauguration.

I'm sick of this shit!  Trump, Fox and further-right media are directly responsible for the alienation we all feel from our friends and family members that have fallen for this QAnon/adjacent nonsense.  Further, America came into this pandemic with everything going for it from a healthcare standpoint.  Trump and right-wing media are responsible for America's despicable response to the pandemic, thus responsible for the excessive deaths/disabilities caused by covid and the isolation caused by excessive lockdowns!

These are ALL real loses attributable to ongoing lies created, escalated, and repeated ad nauseam by these individuals, businesses, networks, and publications.

885,Odd connection,"First time posting here and I apologize if this is long winded or odd.

I ran across an article about folks losing people they cared about to QAnon.  I have heard of QAnon but never thought anything of it as I have no interest in hearing what they have to say.  That being said, my brother joined a cult and moved to Mexico a few years ago and I did a ton of research on that cult in order to get him to see reason.

Fast forward to today when I read the article about QAnon.  There are a number of similarities to the cult my brother follows and QAnon.  While I understand that the whole cult mentality is to use fear and confusion to gain followers, there are things that make me think they are linked and perhaps being ran by the same group of people.

The thing that caught my attention was the mention of lizard people.  The cult my brother follows believes that there are also lizard people that have put scales over our eyes to hide the truth.  I havent done research into the amount of cults that believe in lizard people but it seems obscure enough to raise a red flag for me.  

I am not going to give the full background of the cult because I do not want to give them any more attention than they are already getting but the cult was started by a man name Raymond Lear.  Long story short, there was a weird light over a temple in Jerusalem back in 2011 and that was when he was turned into ""the Lord"" and now goes by lord ray-el (who is supposed to be Jesus).    


Doing some digging, the group from Baja Mexico as been out of contact since the begging of January due to being on a ""special mission"".  Perhaps it is purely coincidence or perhaps it is correlated.  The group like most cults, is all about power and money.  One of my brothers jobs in the cult was to reach out to embassies and consulates to let them know of ray-el's return.  I cannot help but wonder that perhaps combining religion and politics would get them more followers and more money.  The way that they use fake new to push their agenda is also super similar.

It would bring me immense joy to bring down both cults and bring that group to justice if what I suspect is true.",QAnonCasualties

I just had twins last year so it‚Äôs been really difficult not to have my mom around because she was such a good mom to me when I was a child. 

After January 6th I gave my mom an ultimatum- you can continue to be addicted to conspiracy theories or you can have a relationship with me and your grand babies. She literally chose conspiracy theories. The more I think about it, the more it hurts. And then continued to talk about how sick it is of people (antifa according to her) to dress up as Trump supporters to storm the capital. I had been talking to a therapist for a few months before this trying to learn coping skills to make it all make sense and try to navigate boundaries in a different type of relationship with my mom. So this was the final straw. 

I knew things were getting bad when she literally brought her computer with her to my twin sonogram appointment last year and was Facebooking sharing conspiracy theories and pro-Trump propaganda from the waiting room.

They are genuinely shocked that Covid-19 simply hasn‚Äôt gone away yet because the election is over.

We even have an aunt who is on her deathbed and they refuse to wear a mask to come visit her.

One of their biggest arguments against Covid-19 being a hoax is that they don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs had it (which is a lie because other family members have).

I really think the only thing that will snap them out of it is if they themselves get a particularly rough case of Covid-19.",QAnonCasualties
912,I have a kind of peculiar situation.,"My mom and my oldest sister are clearly both long into q. Their beliefs are getting more erratic, (though they were always a bit strange) ranging from the idea that trump was prophesized to win the election, to biden is a satanist, power outages incoming, the military will help trump (somehow they will take down pope francis in the process), and the capital raid was done by antifa bussed in and paid for by joe biden. They are storing bags of rice now in case of some ill defined food shortage.

So you would think that she is getting more mean and hostile in the process of getting more into Q... but actually the reverse is happening. 

I got married three months ago. My family is largely white with german background, but my wife is vietnamese. But my mom instantly started treating her... nicer than she does to her own kids. She goes out of her way to make her feel welcome, has never said anything ecen vaguely directly hostile to her, and went out of her way to help her plan a chinese new year party with my family, which is something we obviously never did before then. And she even wanted to find videos to teach my nieces and nephews about it so that they would be familiar. My mom acts afraid to even make her upset, and will change the subject if she is starting to say something she thinks is upsetting her.

As for me, I get the indirect benefit of the fact that she apparently doesn't want to do anything to *me* that might make my wife upset. A huge change from how she treated me a year ago. Not that she was always hostile, but more than she needed to be for sure. She still acts passive agreasive to me about political things, but now usually ends it and moves on faster.

Now, obviously Q is not what is making her nicer. But its just a bizarre tension with the fact that she is getting nicer at the same time as her beliefs are getting crazier. (And believe me, they were already crazy).

Since its not making problems for me, I would just wait for it to blow over... but there's an issue. She is trying to spread her craziness to my nieces and nephews. Openly telling them that antifa attacked the capital and the media are covering for them. My nieces and nephews' parents are conservative. They aren't as extreme, but... they are conservative enough that they will bend over backwards to avoid challenging any conservative slant. Even if they aren't quite Q, they don't like challenging my mom, and even worse, don't like challenging conservatism. So they seem to be in a place where they'd rather avoid talking politics with their kids, and give only the most vague of an indication that my mom is going too far, since they don't want to challenge anything my mom tells them is some type of core conservstives belief. Its a wierd situation.

So my mom and my other sister are basically trying to brainwash the kids into Q. I don't want to challenge her much too directly since she is acting nice, and my abused-by-her-own-family wife really needed a close family replacement. So rocking the boat isn't a good option. And she is long past the ability to actually care about evidence. (Showing her bad stuff trump did in the past is met with the excuse that he used to be bad but is a changed man). 

I can't try talking to the kids too directly, since my ability to get time with them is largely predicated on not bringing up anything their parents don't like. Politics and religion being a core one. No one in my family knows my exact politics, but for that reason most, be they left or right are a little suspicious of them. I just use it as an opportunity to avoid pointless arguments. 

So I'm in this kind of peculiar position. How can I keep the kids protected from Q nonsense without it looking like I'm talking to them about politics? For that matter, how can I get my mom out of it without it looking like an agressive challenge? The kids range in ages from 6 to 16. But they are all fairly sheltered.",QAnonCasualties

918,Worried My Dad is Falling Into Q,"I apologize for the length here‚ÄîI really need a place to get this off my chest. I feel like I‚Äôve been holding this in for months. 

My father has been quite conservative since I was a kid. My mother is more liberal, and my siblings tend toward libertarianism‚Äîmeanwhile I‚Äôm very left-leaning. Through high school and into college, my dad and I disagreed on a lot, but we could discuss it (sometimes at length!). I felt like he valued my thoughts and listened to me. We live in a rural area and I think my father doesn‚Äôt make friends easily. He‚Äôs often turned to online groups for company. 

Over the last five years he‚Äôs taken a slow dive into theories and rhetoric that sound more and more Q-adjacent: cracks about the Obamas, George Soros, and transgender ‚Äúagendas.‚Äù Trump could do no wrong. The past year everything ramped up. He‚Äôs said things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that the virus is all that bad;‚Äù regarding my aunt (who has diabetes, and is very careful about COVID as a result) he tells me ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs scaring herself about COVID.‚Äù He wears a mask, grudgingly, but says things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a free person.‚Äù And he seems to really believe that the election was stolen in a mass conspiracy by the Democrats. I recently found out that a close friend of his attended the Capitol rally in January. When I try to discuss things with him, he brings up statistics and talking points I‚Äôve never heard of, which all seem to be misleading or misreported when I dig into them afterward.

 I feel cut off from him‚Äîwe‚Äôve talked less and less, and while I miss him I also feel that nervous twisting in my stomach when I think about calling. I know his and my mother‚Äôs relationship has suffered, which worries me too. And my father and I work in the same line of business. We have many connections in common; he introduced me to several business partners and friends‚Äîall of whom want nothing to do with QAnon. I feel terribly guilty even thinking these thoughts, but I‚Äôve wondered more than once if I may someday have to reforge those relationships or lose them to awkwardness if they find out about my father‚Äôs leanings. I‚Äôd love any advice people might give me. I know that arguing doesn‚Äôt work, but I‚Äôm desperate for any strategy.",QAnonCasualties
919,My Dad Knowingly Gave Covid To My Whole Family(including me),"My dad has been massively radicalized towards Q, and generally the conspiracy right for the last four years, and he also cannot stand being told what to do. I‚Äôm 18, but I live at home for the time being since my college is close by. 

So naturally, when lockdown started, he refused to enforce our state‚Äôs mask mandate in his business. My mom is a nurse, and we both had huge fights with him over it(she‚Äôs into conspiracies too, but nowhere near as far gone). No matter how hard we fought, no matter if I refused to speak to him or the fact that this nearly ended his and my mom‚Äôs marriage, we could. Not. Get him to put on a damn mask at work. It was a huge victory when he‚Äôd wear one to the store. Eventually, we sorta forgot about it, since he became more distant as I revealed that I...you know...took the pandemic seriously and all. Eventually, I ended up in the car with him around New Years, and he called his secretary(and sister...who‚Äôs probably even more into Q than he is) to tell her he would be in late because I was having car trouble. 
Well she sounded HORRIBLE, she could barely talk and she was coughing every other word. I told her that she needed to leave immediately, because she was obviously sick, but dad cut me off and said ‚Äúwe need her in for a meeting today, I don‚Äôt care if she‚Äôs sick or not‚Äù. Dad went to the office, and then my family saw my grandma for New Years.(she lives very very close to us and I didn‚Äôt want to go, but when you live at home with a very ‚Äúwe‚Äôre the parents and you‚Äôll do what we say when we say it‚Äù family there‚Äôs not much you can do) 
As you might imagine, dad was coughing his lungs up the entire time, and I tried my hardest to avoid him, but two days later I started coughing too and mom generally felt like crap. 
For context, mom has a preexisting condition(type 1 diabetes), dad‚Äôs lungs are shot from years of heavy smoking, and my grandma was finishing up recovery from a knee replacement. Mom was able to get tested immediately since she worked at the hospital, but I waited a day since I had so little energy I couldn‚Äôt drive myself. In the day we waited, mom came back positive, dad refused to get tested, and CONTINUED TO GO INTO WORK. He told mom that she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt really positive‚Äù because ‚Äúthe hospital gets paid every time they get a positive test‚Äù and that ‚Äú[my name] won‚Äôt test positive because she‚Äôs being tested by the health department‚Äù 
My results came back positive
He shut up pretty damn fast about that
After this, we all assumed that he just had covid, because we had to get it somewhere, and begged him not to go to work and spread it further, but he claimed he was fine, and that his work was more important, so he continued to go
Mom almost divorced him over this. 
She should‚Äôve 
Skipping ahead to the end of my contagious period, I ended up in the hospital because of how short of breath I was. Since I‚Äôm 18 and they wanted to do some kinda high demand tests on me, I ended up staying overnight in Pediatrics instead of going to the emergency room. Because I was in Peds, dad was allowed to stay with me(because he would‚Äôve ended his contagious period before me, and mine was over) The doctors were great, but he insisted on borderline yelling about his conspiracies the entire time(it was around inauguration day at this point, so he was gearing up for some violent bs I suppose) and hoo boy did he have some problems when the doctor told me he had received his second shot that day. 
The doctor while trying to make small talk asked me if I planned to get the vaccine, and my heart sank. I had been avoiding talking about it with dad for genuine fear of being kicked out, but I couldn‚Äôt tell the doctor I didn‚Äôt.
So I told him the truth and said as SOON AS POSSIBLE, the second I could get in line I wanted the shot, because holy shit covid sucks and I never want it again. 
Dad was pissed at me, and after I got home(tests came back okay, no heart or lung trouble, working on getting an inhaler cause breathing is still hard almost two months later)  he gave out my number to all his work buddies so they could send me vaccine conspiracies and Q stuff. 
I‚Äôm an 18 year old woman...excuse me if I get angry when my dad gives my number to strangers more than double my age to harass me. 
I had come to terms with really losing dad back in the fall, but to think he would knowingly endanger my entire family hit me in a different place entirely, the effect is still felt at this house, and mom and I still suffer from breathing issues and low energy. I‚Äôm a dancer, so not being able to breathe well is agonizing for me in the studio. 
I genuinely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever forgive him for this, he still doesn‚Äôt wear a mask at work, or make anyone else wear one either, us getting sick AGAIN is honestly likely. My parents try to control my finances as much as possible, and I can‚Äôt get a job currently, so I can‚Äôt move out to avoid the mental and physical harm of living with people so divorced from reality. It uh..sucks pretty bad, sorry for such a long and incoherent vent, I‚Äôve been lurking here for a while n made an account to get it off my chest.

921,Possible strategy for dealing with believers: place bets with them,"Listen to what they're saying. When they predict something specific that's obviously batshit (""Trump will institute martial law right before Joe Biden is inaugurated"") place a bet with them. Make it as large as is responsible based on your and their income. $50 is probably a good starting place. This brings salience to the correctness of their beliefs - when they believe conspiracies that they can't really act on other than constantly consuming media, there's never any tests to their beliefs. Add one. Make it hurt to fail. Make them fail a ""are my beliefs true"" test repeatedly. 

Be specific, trying to minimize wiggle room. ""I bet you $200 that Joe Biden's inaugaration will be shown, or at least discussed as a true fact on CNN, Fox, Breitbart, and &lt;the local paper&gt; on January 20th, and that these sources will say he is still in power one week later"" is a better bet than ""I bet he'll be inaugurated on the 20th.""

925,why can't i hate her,"My mother has always been difficult and conservative. She's a high-level narcissist. She listened religiously to Dr. Laura and consumed a lot of Fox News. When I came out as trans to her she apologized to me for all the hateful things she said about other trans people by saying she was still learning... later on, I found out that my Aunt--one of her sisters--has been trans this whole time (my mom's family is from the Philippines, where trans people are more common and accepted), revealing that whole ""just learning"" thing to be a lie. Earlier during the pandemic, she kicked my sister out of the house after a fight about washing dishes. When I asked my mom how she could vote for Trump despite my own experiences with sexual assault, she replied with ""You never told me that,"" as if to gaslight me into thinking I never confided with her about the biggest trauma of my entire life, which I \*did\*.

I wish I could hate her and yet I still love her and worry constantly about her. Even just last May, when the pandemic was still in the beginning stages, my mom was very careful about wearing masks, washing hands, taking everything seriously. That all changed in summer, when she found some sort of far-right podcast. In just a matter of months she went from a regular Fox News watcher to a Breitbart commenter, and then later a Q espouser. I keep trying to tell myself not to feel sorry for her, because this was always how she was deep down, yet I can't really commit to that. Even with how conservative she was in the past, she still seemed to ""love"" me, even in her own toxic, weird way. Now not even that is left, and I've been blindsided by how fast the change has been. In less than a year from when she first started listening to those podcasts, she began to beg our entire family not to take the vaccine, that Bill Gates and China orchestrated the pandemic, that Gavin Newsom is a plant sent from China, that the face masks are the same as armbands in Nazi Germany.. She'd stockpile food telling us that martial law would be declared soon. When doing the laundry, dad would find that she stitched the words ""MAGA"" and ""TRUMP"" into her clothing. She even bought a gun, despite having never been interested in firearms before, and started to install some kind of anti-riot bar on the front door... even though she and my dad live in a gated community. She isolated every one of her brothers and sisters. Even one of my other aunts, a vocal trump supporter, has said she had to stop talking with our mom because ""she's lost it"". Mom has even ended her closest friendships because they don't believe her conspiracy theories. My dad will soon be leaving her, he's just fed up with her sending him conspiracy images and texts day in and day out. 

She was always deep down like this, yes. And yet, she's also a completely different person. Any semblance of love she was holding onto is gone now. And I want so desperately to say good riddance and never think about her again, yet I can't. Every day I worry and mourn and grieve for her and who she used to be. Even with how shitty she's been in the past, I feel like I've lost someone. Even with how bad she's been, she's somehow gotten \*worse\*, which I thought impossible. 

It's been hard to confide in my friends because none of them know what this is like or what I'm going through. All of my lefty friends like to make jokes about Qanon and Trump supporters and how stupid and crazy they all are, and I can't blame them because it does feel that way from the outset. But I can't bring myself to laugh with them, and if anything it makes me uncomfortable. That ppl can derive some kind of schadenfreude in something that has managed to dissolve my entire family from the inside out, that's turned every conversation in the house into a tense minefield, that worsened all our lives as my mom refuses to wear masks and brings germs to my dad and drives both of my sisters out of the house. She's completely alone now, and even if that's what she deserves, it still sucks to watch her spiral further and further.

On January 5th, I found out that my mom was not going to Stockton to visit family, but instead flying to Washington D.C. to take part in the protests. The day after, the insurrection happened. And while none of us know for sure whether or not she was with those people who broke into the Capitol building, what we do know is that, either way, she's not just toxic anymore, she's flat-out dangerous. Something activated her. Something told her to go to D.C. on January 6th, a day that these Q-ers have been actively planning. What's left is not the woman who raised me but some kind of soldier for a holy war that doesn't actually exist.

I want my goddamn mother back, warts and all. I hate that that's something I have to say, and I hate that even my closest friends can hardly fathom how to comfort me. I always stuck my nose up w/r/t reddit but I've just felt so alone and reading that huffpo article that came out today only made me feel more depressed.

At the beginning it was ""normal"" I'd say but it was getting more and more extreme and he manipulates her completely with all this Q s*it and dragged it into her. She believes everything he tells her she doesn't even has a own opinion... When Biden became president and the storm(ü§£ü§£ü§£) wasn't coming I really hoped she'd wake up but nothing happened.

When I visit her, she sits on the phone all day.
Sometimes at 1am in the morning she's in her bed and watching videos on YT about adrenochrome and child trafficking. I can no longer reach her, she has become strange to me. I don't know who my own mother is thanks to her boyfriend. He broke her completely. I would never do it, but I often had thoughts of ki*ling him because he turned my mother into a robot. He is a psychopath. I'm lost. I don't know what do to anymore. I just want my old mum back... :(",QAnonCasualties
933,What if Trump died?,"I have been so fascinated with the mind set of Q followers and how obsessed they are with Trump and their conspiracy theories. I haven't seen any post or comment about what they would do or believe in if Trump were to pass away. Obviously I do not wish ill will upon anyone (even though he would deserve it) but I mean he is kinda old right.. it could happen soon? 

I'm genuinely curious what Qanon people would do if he died. Part of me wants to believe they would completely lose faith and drop it but I can't see that happening either..",QAnonCasualties

935,"""lost"" a brother.....","The rabbit hole I witnessed began with a long conversation over the 2019 holidays with my family. My brother, with whom I've had a very close relationship, began steering the conversation in a direction that supported the theory of race based intelligence. I was horrified. I have daughters and grandchildren of color AND our own family has SE Asian heritage. So for my brother to be buying into this garbage was shocking to say the least. I mourned after that. Since, I have observed his descent into Trumpisms and far right wing conspiracies. He has been involved in a fundamentalist church for many years, and I am fully aware of the insular viewpoints of said religion. I was once a fundie as well. Since that conversation our relationship has been strained. Though we have had a long discussion about proceeding forward in the name of peace and family love and to just avoid 'those' topics, it still does NOT sit well with me. I know that he has voted on behalf  of his kids - all disabled adults - for the far right candidates during this past election. I know that he proselytizes in public - anti mask, covid denier, etc. with his kids (they posted on FB). So, yeah. No matter how intelligent - or potential intelligence - a person may have, if they are already conditioned to follow a belief without question, then it is not a far stretch to see them totally accept something simply because one of their 'leaders' has stated so.",QAnonCasualties

938,Preventative measures?,"Joined reddit just to make this post tbh. Throwaway, not linked to my other socials.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents, while republican and evangelical, have been negative on Trump and QAnon. They've expressed that those in their social circles who are Trumpers, Qultists, and antimaskers are kooks, but..... I still worry they're still at risk for being radicalized. They still easily associate with these people who spout political bullshit, they don't pay attention to news journalism because ""it's all for ratings"", while they believe covid exists they're lax about masks and distancing, their casual racial biases means they're not exactly positive on progressive movements like BLM, and both of them spend a lot of time on the internet-- my mother on FB and my dad on YT. Both of them are stressed because of the pandemic and my dad's layoff. If they stumble across the wrong branch of Q conspiracies, they're primed for it. I dunno, one of the ones with Antifa plants or pedo rings.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect my influence on them is limited, as not only are they aware my political beliefs are different from theirs, I'm their child-- and my mother still treats me like \*a\* child most of the time. But as long as I'm living with them I have the best chance to keep them from slipping into this cult shit, more than anyone else around them anyway.

940,Not quite Q'ed Mom but she's on her way - don't know what to do,"After complaining about my mother's antics for a while my friend recommended this subreddit to me.
I don't know if my mother has been Completely taken over by Q but I think she's well on her way there.
This is mostly just to air out my dirty laundry, though if anyone has advice that would be greatly appreciated. :)

My mother is a well-meaning and kind person, and I love her to death. Unfortunately, she's fairly deep in right-wing conspiracy theory and I'm afraid sooner or later she'll start believing actual QAnon conspiracy. I know exactly how this descent happened - she's a very devout Christian, watching sermons on Youtube and such. When I had complained to her about Trump back in 2016/2017 she initially agreed with me and said that he truly did sound like a horrid man, and so she looked him up on Youtube to watch anything informative. I believe her Youtube algorithm sent her more right-wing leaning videos bc of her search history (what is it with American Christians and being right wing? lol). And it only got worse from there.
She doesn't believe in ridiculous statements like 5G causes cancer or anything and is not an anti masker/covid denier, but she's wholly convinced that the 2020 elections were rigged in Biden's favor, that ANTIFA were responsible for the Jan. 6th Capitol terrorist attack, and that the COVID vaccine is dangerous and won't get it until basically everyone else does and is aware of any long term side effects. It's caused deeper strains in my parent's relationship to the point where my father sometimes vents to me about her.
By no means do I blame my family's religion by the way - I am a practicing Christian myself. What hurts the most for me is the way the algorithms and other right wing figureheads manipulated her into believing all of this, despite the fact that my sister, my father, and I have disproven her statements multiple times.
I'm 21 years old and still live with my family due to the pandemic - otherwise, I would be on campus at my college. Cutting my mother off entirely is a rather unrealistic option for me due to having four younger siblings (I'm the eldest child). While the rest of my sisters are aware of how ridiculous my mom sounds sometimes my brother soaks up everything she says, and that's what concerns me the most. Cutting her off from my life would give me guilt about being unable to watch over my brother along with fears of losing my first language (I speak to my father and one of my sisters almost entirely in English, along with my friends and partner.)
I'm wondering if I should sneak her phone away from her for a bit and completely wipe all of her Youtube search/view history and subscriptions and replace them with, well, Not conspiracy theorists. But I don't know, it's something I've entertained in my head for a while now. I apologize for any part of this post being incredibly convoluted and hard to read.",QAnonCasualties

942,To those struggling with family/loved ones trapped by Q-Anon (LONG),"I am writing this not because I claim to be an ""expert"" - (anyone is more than welcome to disagree with me), but coming at it from someone who, along with my wife, was drawn into a bible-based cult many years ago - which led to much family division and heartache. Q-Anon is now doing this with families all over this country, and even around the world. After I started to doubt certain things about the cult and it's teachings, we managed to get out - and started researching cults voraciously, wanting to know how we were so ""gullible"". (We weren't - we were targeted and lied to, but that's another story). It is my hope that what I've learned about cults through researching for many years, along with what I am witnessing now from my own family members, can help others at least understand better what is happening to their loved ones who have been caught by Q-Anon and who have turned against their families in the process.

I have learned much about how yesterday's cults kidnap people's minds. But now, I'm seeing something terrifyingly different. Normally, cults operate from the top down, with one charismatic leader dictating cult rules and behaviors. They can be politically based, or religion-based, etc. But what we see happening with Q is different. It is a melding of two very cult-like mindsets into an online ""super-cult"" that has combined the worst aspects of radical politics with the worst aspects of radicalized religion. It didn't start out being the most powerful brainwashing tool on the planet, but it found a niche and exploited it - and in the process, created something so powerful even the original group that created it could never have foreseen.

It survives and changes based on ""new information"" but always has one main goal - to destroy anyone, any group, or anything that dares question the idol/leader, and to constantly instill fresh fear into it's adherents. The combination of these into a fear-based super spreader cult mentality has created something that is more instant and interactive than television, and that grabs it's followers and turns them, literally, into individuals that are incapable of rational thought. They have been conditioned to believe only Q, or the idol/leader. No information that, even in the slightest way, deviates from the information being supplied by Q will be accepted by the adherents. In fact, many have pledged their devotion to the cause so deeply that they are more than willing to die for the cause. Q encourages adherents to ""do the research"" but in actuality the ""research"" is just articles and videos that support the premise - whatever that might be.

One really unfortunate aspect of Q is that it latches onto the idea of religious fervor, and that its adherents are doing what is ‚Äúright by God and for God‚Äù by believing all of the stuff Q tells them. It mixes religion and politics in a way that is almost impossible for someone on the outside looking in to penetrate. It radicalizes even moderate Christians into zealots who believe that only Q and Trump have the right answers, as Trump has been ‚Äúordained, blessed and anointed by God‚Äù ‚Äì probably the most dangerous statement ever made in this century. Their love for God and their faith is hijacked, reversed, and put on steroids. Instead of love being the most important commandment, hate toward those who are not Christian is emphasized and violence/war is presented as ‚Äúholy‚Äù and ‚Äúfor the cause‚Äù. Everyone who does not stand for Q or Trump is definitely NOT Christian to the followers of Q. Everyone who doesn‚Äôt believe Trump‚Äôs continual stream of lies and hate speech is suspect. Everyone who tries to preach a more moderate, loving version of faith is ridiculed and cast aside.

Personally, I've seen the destruction first-hand that cults can do, long before Q. And now, some of my family have been drawn in and they have completely removed any contact with my family over their belief propagated by this super-cult. I see the hate, the rage, all of the things that keep them addicted to the cult. And Q keeps a steady stream of fresh hate and fear going to their adherents. The adherents also contribute and in turn produce more hate and fear and suspicion. It feeds on it's adherents and the adherents feed on themselves as well - and don't hesitate to turn on anyone who is seen to be disloyal to the idol/leader, which right now is still Donald Trump - however the idol can be replaced, and will be replaced when the effectiveness of the current idol is no longer serving the cult well.

**The only effective way for someone to get out of a cult is for them to come to the conclusion on their own that the cult is not what it purports to be.** It is a process of realization - and it can only come from within themselves. Others can point the way, and in the days of ""deprogrammers"" they can point the way very forcefully (sometimes illegally, back in the day). But regardless, it is only the adherent who can extract themselves from it, because it is actually a prison of the mind, and that prison is also designed and forged with thick iron bars and walls of belief to keep them in. They are constantly being told that anyone outside of the cult is ""dangerous"" and ""lost"" and ""ignorant"" and ""the enemy"". The cult will use every lie and apply every kind of psychological pressure in order to maintain control. There is no easy escape. Those trying to help others get out of the cult must exercise patience, empathy and understanding - which is also hard to do when cult members are constantly assailing them, insulting them, threatening them, or otherwise using any and every cult tactic to push them away.

Because of the power of instant information and technology, what used to be limited and more fringe has now become mainstream, including cults - and Q is just the first hugely successful online-based cult that has utilized both old cult tactics and new social media tactics in order to snare its adherents. And because the online relationship is directly into the adherent's mind with no filter and no checks or balances, it is exponentially more potent and powerful than cults of yesterday. It is direct, it is designed to be addictive, and it uses hate, fear and dopamine rushes to completely take over the mind of it's target. **It is very much like a new and super-addictive drug.**

**The only true antidote to a cult is information.** But in this case, the cult IS the only ""true"" source of information - an idea drilled into the minds of those who participate over and over again. The ""fake news"" media, the ""lying politicians"", the ""unwashed masses"" - all are suspect and none are to be trusted. Family members who try to step in and talk sense are immediately shut down, sometimes in a fit of rage from adherents whose ability to accept information contrary to the cult has been completely cut off. They cannot and will not listen to outsiders. They will not accept that they are wrong. And they will not ever be persuaded by angry arguments around facts, because facts are relative to the whims of the cult.

One technique that has been successful in breaking through to some Q-Anon adherents is supplying them with passive information that is sent to them without conversation or confrontation (i.e. via email, for example) - information that lays out in detail why certain beliefs of the cult are wrong or harmful. Preface it by saying that you know they like to research, and you hope they would take a look at some that you‚Äôve found. Letting the adherent believe that they were the one doing the research that led them out of the cult is key, because only they can free themselves from a mind prison they have been led into and have maintained themselves. Nobody can force you where you don't want to go - however if you believe you were the one wanting to go, getting there is ultimately possible.

I hope that those out there who have lost or are losing family members to this dangerous and absolutely insane cult are able to find ways to bring their loved ones back, or at least to understand what really happened to them - for while we are all ultimately responsible for our thoughts and actions, there has been simply nothing on this planet that compares to the power of Q-Anon to snare someone's mind and not let go, causing pain, untold heartache, anger, violence and raw hate to families, institutions, governments, and countries. I believe the third world war has begun, and the battlefield in this war is the battle for our minds. It is not a stretch to believe that, as we have so tearfully witnessed almost half of our country fall into this mind trap called Q-Anon. I have lost family members to Q that, ironically, tried to get us out of our cult many years before! I wish all who are going through this type of situation all the best.

945,Awash in a sea of Q,"Hey y‚Äôall, I found this sub in my favorite Facebook group. I‚Äôve been reading through the posts and I finally feel like there are people out there who are sane and rational.

Basically my entire family, immediate and extended, are die-hard Trumpers. I had to block my dad from social media because of his hate-filled, fear-mongering posts. He is OBSESSED with Trump, he genuinely thinks that piece of shit is like, the second coming of Jesus. He‚Äôs asked me a few times if I wanted to go to dinner with him to have a ‚Äúfact-filled conversation‚Äù. He came by my house to pick up my daughter for a night, and he spent the entire ten minutes ranting about how Kamala Harris isn‚Äôt actually black, Biden is going to cause me to lose my job (I work for Chewy.com, so I‚Äôm not sure how that‚Äôs gonna happen), and how the entire country is basically going to collapse without Trump. His racism has also been put out there for the world to see.

I‚Äôve never had a great relationship with my dad, so his crap doesn‚Äôt surprise me, but what breaks my heart is what happened to my mom. The most empathetic, compassionate, and loving woman I know has turned into a full-blown Trumper and Qer. She really and truly believes that Will Smith and Tom Hanks are cannibalistic pedophiles who sell children to other celebrities to rape and eat. She has become so racist and radical, she refuses to shop at Target anymore because they support BLM, has thrown out all her makeup that are from black-owned companies, etc. She posted something on her business IG a while ago that was something about executing members of the Deep State. That was the first thing that I saw from her about this bullshit. She‚Äôs sunk so far into it, it‚Äôs actually scary.

Also in my whacko family are my grandfather, who referred to masks as ‚Äúslave harnesses‚Äù, and my great aunt who swore that the QAnon Shaman was a ‚ÄúBLM guy‚Äù. When he was identified as the Shaman, it was radio silence from her. She also claimed it was BLM who stormed the Capitol in Trump gear because there were photos of them holding up one fist, the ‚ÄúBLM signal‚Äù.

948,I've been barred from an entire town.,"First of all, I'm very happy to have found you folks. I feel like a man adrift in an ocean of this insanity. To date I've lost my sister to this nonsense and several close friends. My sister is probably the most disappointing because she's a extremely intelligent individual who has been a teacher for more than a decade. But I digress...

I'm from a town in eastern Ohio that is predominantly  white Trump supporters, we have the occasional liberal or Democrat but for the most part its lower middle income Republicans. The next town over houses 2 bars a small gas station and a 100% Caucasian population. It would probably be a sundown town if they knew what that was. In other words I'm completely surrounded. Being small towns everybody knows everybody, everyone is friend on FB. So at the start of this pandemic when I first heard of Q and everything that it entails, I noticed that it was always being shared by the owners of the bars and their regulars/ friends. So doing my civic duty, I'd point out the flaws in their logic and the facts that could be proven fairly easily. It would end with name calling or them flat out deleting my comments to try and make me look nonsensical. But I never stopped, I wasnt going to let misinformation be peddled unopposed. It continued on like that, small back and forth until Fall. 

Now fall rolls around and election is coming up, the things they're sharing have become increasingly insane and at this point it's the entire town joining this discussion about the storm and the deep state pedophiles(which happened to be any celebrity that spoke out against Trump. Imagine that). And those that havent blocked me are increasingly ignorant. I've been called mentally handicapped and it's been inferred that I shouldn't be allowed around my infant son because I'm a pedophile supporter although not in such friendly terms. But right before the election it goes all out, I have an argument with one of the women who own the bar and her friend. Then next thing I know I have their husbands and their friends(including several with fake names like Underhill from out of state) in my DMs telling me they're going to sexually assault my wife and kill me and my son. My mom's life is threatened, and I'm basically told by several people that if I show up in town that they'll never find my body. My cars windows get broken, tires flattened,  and my house gets paint thrown on it. 

I get cops involved and they basically do nothing which I expected because of the level of political affiliation involved around here. The cops just tell me to avoid that town. A resident I considered a friend of 20 years told me  that I probably shouldn't get gas in that town anymore, to not even drive through it. They blitzed my FB page and reported everything clear back to 2014, so I've basically served consecutive 30 day bans since the end of October. I've got six days left, hopefully I can manage to stay on this time, I think I've deleted and scoured my friend lists to manage to not be banned. I ended up getting my concealed carry and getting a weapon for protection. I'm probably going to end up moving. 

All of this because I wouldn't let their echo chamber go undisturbed. An entire town just swallowed by this shit. I was never ignorant, never name called. I was just persistent to the point where I was the topic of conversation in the bars every night. I've pretty much got them all blocked now so they cant get me banned from FB but my friend tells me they're all still circle the wagons for March 4th. Just riding the wave of insanity.

950,Any other Q-casualties interested in a realtime chat/support group on Clubhouse?,"Hey all! Casualty here‚ÄîI've lost both my parents to this thing, and I strongly suspect a few of my siblings have a foot down the rabbit hole as well. The parents were always into Christian prophecies and alternative medicine, but things took a Q-turn a few years ago before I realized what was going on. By the time I figured out what they'd gotten themselves into, it was far, far too late to stage an intervention. They don't talk to me any more, and I've basically had to grieve them as if they'd died. 

So thank you for sharing your stories. They've really helped me process the loss.

And that leads me to my real question: Is anyone interested in some realtime chat about this on Clubhouse? 

The reason I ask: When I left my faith several years ago, I started a support group for those in my shoes, and...gosh, it's hard to overestimate how healing it was to talk to people who were going through the same hurt and sadness as I was. I love this subreddit for much the same reason, but I also feel the need to talk to folks in real time, to listen to other stories, and‚Äîmaybe‚Äîto collectively brainstorm ways to move beyond this. Coincidentally, I just got a Clubhouse invite, and it seems like an ideal platform to get direct conversation going about this.

Is anyone else interested? 

If so, I'll organize. (I'm new to this, but shoot me your screen names, etc., and we'll figure it out.)

Then, at age 10, we started hanging out with these new groups of families.  We would all meet up at someplace, and they had cool kids that I would hang out with.  But now, looking back, I realized, that she was shedding old friends.  Lifetime friends since *she* was 8 years old.  These great family friends I had, she got rid of due to the fact that they were doctors and believed that vaccines were safe.  TF?  My mom would yell and scream at them on the phone, about how bad and terrible all these vaccines are, and it's all for depopulation, and control, and money.

Now, here we are in a pandemic.  During the start of it, she started getting heavily into q anon, she then proceeded to shed all friends that didn't think this pandemic was planned!

Then I said, that way too extreme, it's just breathing through a cloth.  and that it's not a big deal to have to talk through it.  and *they* definitely do not create masks with the sole purpose of destroying human connection.  and then I asked why the hell would *they* even do that.

""Control.""

Then we had this huge argument about how *they* are not trying to control us, and that how they're shutting down the world for more control.  On and on and on, until she was screaming at me.  A grown woman, screaming at her 13-year-old son for disagreeing with her.  

Then she proceeded to taunt Me:

 "" Oh, yeah \[my name\] go get your fucking vaccine, and drink and eat poison.  well I am not going to take care of you fat ass (funny enough, I am diagnosed as underweight.  I have to eat, *a lot* in order to feel full. I think it's my metabolism. also I am going through puberty, burning calories), and I won't pay for your medical bills.  you can go to hell""

Yep, my mom said that to me.  We have conversation like these weekly, and I am the devil who wants to join the sheeple, and my mom is trying to save me.

Then, she goes on to say that she wants to have an equally respected opinion like me.  Well no, mom.  you can't yell at me for 15 minutes about how I am wrong, and that you are right.  And no, you don't respect *my* opinion, but I respect yours.  very well. 

Mom, I know you can't read this, you don't even know I have an account.  But if you could magically read this,  I do respect your opinion, it's just that you yell and get aggressive when people don't believe you.  well, you don't believe me.  that's fine, agree to disagree, but no.  that's not enough for me.  I have to believe you, or else you yell at me and others.

And, then worst of all, my little sister, believes all that my mom is saying.  and it's frustrating, but then again, my sister has the right to believe what she wants.

AND, In case you haven't noticed, my mom is a Karen.  she will make a grocery store minimum wage worker, have the hardest hour of their lives, trying to make my mom wear a mask.  that's a whole different story.  I may write it up, but not now.

Thank you everyone for, if you have read my whole post, for reading it.  I had to get this off my chest. It's been driving me nuts. welp, nothing I can do about it.

Doomsday prophecies and satanic panic have been a cornerstone of his rhetoric forever. In 2008 he was quick to jump on the ""Obama is the Antichrist"" train so when Trump came along in 2016 I suppose my dad did see him as a savior.

Since Trump lost the election in November, I've been very worried about my dad. The day the race was called my dad threw a huge tantrum and dramatically destroyed all of his Trump campaign gear, and told me that the end of the world is coming and I should get right with Jesus. My dad would cry apocalypse wolf frequently throughout my youth so this didn't exactly alarm me. What did scare me is that he developed a really nasty streak of COVID denialism that culminated in him saying he would not take the vaccine because it had lead in it and would change his DNA.

My dad is damn difficult but I love him and I don't want him to get sick, or put my chronically ill mom or brother that he lives with at risk. It's been a rough few months, but as a family we've convinced him to bring his concerns about the vaccine to our family doctor instead of using talk radio as his primary source. His position on the vaccine has softened a lot and I think we have a great chance. 

He knows I'm interested in learning a new career and sent me pictures of the CNC machines at his work this morning - the pictures were really terrible and all I could see was his reflection on the doors and that made me laugh.

970,Using QAnon tactics to try to break the spell,"We all know that Christianity is a huge part of how QAnoners real in many of their followers. I‚Äôm not here to pushing Christian beliefs nor to deny the validity of them, simply stating my opinion on a tactic that may help when trying to pull loved ones out of the cult. Anytime God or the Bible is brought up to argue a point, I research what the Bible really says about that matter. If I find contradictory verses then I present them. Again this is not about religion itself but the more you can get them to question what they are being told by Q and QAnoners, the hold loosens. Another thing is many of them thrive off of emotional responses. When they know they can‚Äôt convince you, they dig for them. If you poke fun at them, they usually either lash out or shut down but either way they‚Äôve stopped listening to you. I know I‚Äôve seen it mentioned before but I‚Äôm going to say it again anyway, the best approach is presenting evidence, learning everything you can about a particular subject so much so that the information you give them let‚Äôs them know or think that you‚Äôre more knowledgeable about the subject than they are and they really haven‚Äôt done the research they should have (not condescendingly), ask how certain facts fit into their belief or conspiracy. If they are avid Trump supporters and look to him as the savior of the free world, find ways that he ties into certain conspiracies and contradicts them. Stuff that is reported and known for a fact. He took the credit for low gas prices, then tell them all about the Russia/Saudi Arabia price war. They‚Äôre anti-foreign friendliness and collusion, tell them all about him jacking up hotel prices for foreign favor. They think he‚Äôs about saving children and stopping human trafficking, tell them all about the Prince of Dubai and what he‚Äôs done to his daughters and wife and how he started the Dubai Global Women‚Äôs Forum where Ivanka was a guest speaker last year. Tell them about his reported monetary ties to two of the Covid vaccine companies, last reported in 2017. Ask them how Bill Gates can own all patents to all vaccines if the Trump Administration had just funded research for and purchased as many as 6. I once fell for QAnon ‚Äúred-pilling‚Äù. Thank goodness I was only under for about two weeks. Those two weeks though I was honestly losing my mind one day at a time the further I got down the rabbit hole. Someone saw a window of opportunity when I started having doubt in what the media was saying vs what I was seeing with my own eyes via live feeds of the riots. Of course now I know exactly what was going on but at the time, that person fed me enough to send me into a spiral and believing that Trump might really be the ‚Äògooder‚Äô guy. What sucked me in was a whirlwind of information, lots of little verifiable truths. If I had stopped at the beginning I might still be there. Luckily, I‚Äôm an avid researcher. I research objectively from all sides and the further I dug into everything, nothing was really as it seemed. The inconsistencies, the absolutely far-fetched conspiracies like reptilian aliens the cabal JFK Jr, all things I never believed but had to just ignore. As well as the detestable crimes and behaviors of Trump himself that we were told to ignore because he only did those things for the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù.

972,i don't think i love my mom anymore,"i miss her

i've always had kinda a rough relationship w my parents, like borderline emotionally abusive. we used to yell and argue and i would cry multiple times a week because of them. still, i thought nothing would ever stop me from loving them. i thought maybe it was just a teenager thing and once i got into my 20s or moved out things would change. i'm 17 now and i don't know if i'll ever really love my mom again.

when she first got into qanon(around last april-before that she was a democrat for her whole life), i still had hope for her/our relationship, but she's genuinely become such a mean person since then. when we argue she makes fun of my voice, the way the face i'm making looks, the words i use, etc. it's so frustrating because i would never say that shit to her. it's not only completely irrelevant to the conversation but also just rude. i've pointed it out before and even said it was immature and she always responds with something about me needing to ""learn social manners"" and things like that because she doesn't like the face im making. the thing is i've really never been making a face?? like it's always at the most random times and i've never had anyone else(even ppl in my family who would be comfortable w telling me i look angry or something) say stuff like that to me.

since i was around 13 i've had pretty bad depression and anxiety and at the beginning of quarantine it got even worse. but since november i've really been getting better and working on having a more healthy lifestyle. i feel like all my internal struggles are almost gone now, but when i argue with my mom it's so hard not to spiral. i've gotten better at not crying when we argue, but after every argument we have i go in my room and cry for a long time. i know it sounds dumb but the way she is just has such a big effect on me.

even when we used to argue all the time, i didn't feel like this after. i feel empty and like this huge part of my life if never gonna be the same. the mom that goes on qanon rants is not the mother who raised me. she's a completely different person. she used to support blm but now that's a cult, she used to be a democrat but now they're communists, and she used to care about lgbtq+ rights but now it's unnatural. these might just be her ""political"" beliefs but it's changed her completely as a person, even in the sense that she's way more irritable/angry all the time now.

i hate it because sometimes we'll go for days on end with no arguments and life feels somewhat normal again. in a way it's worse because when the inevitable argument comes im slapped back into reality, that this is what my life and my family has come to. to make it even worse she's been convincing my brother and dad to believe in it. they don't really say much about it so i'm not sure where they stand but my dad is a republican so i feel it might be easier for him to be drawn in

i think the worst memory i have of my mom now is the day she told me about qanon, and i did nothing. she came into my room and was all excited because she ""knows i love conspiracy theories""(i did when i was like 14, and i would watch shane dawson youtube conspiracies. not really comparable to qanon.) she told me there was a thing called q and they've been predicting stuff that's happened. i had heard of it maybe once before and knew it was some right wing thing but i had no idea the extent of it. because of that i acted super uninterested and pretty much jut didn't respond. she left and seemed kinda sad almost? bc i wasn't interested. that memory always makes me cry. maybe cause she was like excited about telling me? it breaks my heart to think if i knew more at the time i could've told her and stopped her from ever getting involved.

the things she's said and ways she's acted are just so horrible. i've tried so hard to get over it and act like when i move out it'll be fine because we won't have to talk about it again. but she's in deep and i've tried so hard to get her out, i don't think she'll ever be my mom again. this person she is now is not somebody i love.

975,An old friend is crawling down the rabbit hole.,"There was an good friend I had years ago, I was (and still am) on the left, she was a moderate libertarian, the type who wanted lower taxes but was pro choice, pro LBGT, non science denier. We disagreed but still got along splendly. We had a falling out, which was mostly my fault. Right before the pandemic, I texted to apologize, we made up and texted each other sometimes since. Recently, she asked me what I though of Ben Shapiro, and I told her he is a pseudo intellectual hack. She asked why, and I responded that he does not debate in good faith, and he even admits to it in a book he wrote. We got into an argument, where she said he was a brilliant intellectual, she said something like ""he reminds me of you, you're so logical, he has a phrase I think you'd like, facts don't care about your feelings"" I told her I did not consider him an intellectual, and shot back with the BBC interview, and she defended his performance there, saying Neil was the one who went too far. Later I showed her some videos by people I prefer listening to, namely Shaun's video where he responds to Steven Crowder, and a couple others by CCK Philosophy and 3 Arrows. Her response was to dismiss it all as part of the woke crowd. I figure there is no arguing with her. I dont know if she believes in Q specifically but she seems to be going down that road, where hatred of lefties seems to trump (heh) any rational based worldviews. I dont know how anyone can look at Ben saying ""I have more Twitter followers than you"" and think that this is the type of thing a great thinker would say. The video on Crowder was basically calling Steven Crowder out for denying being a racist yet using the same arguments racists use. So if she thinks the video is woke, does that mean that she agrees with Crowder when he says black people are genetically predisposed to being dumber than white people? I dont want to know. 

What hurts is that she knows I'm on the left, when she seems Shapiro demonizing leftists as stupid and emotional, does she not realize that Im the target of his disingenuous mockery? Does she think that little of me that she has a cult like admiration for a guy who spends his career trying to humiliate people like me? That I'd appreciate being introduced to his brilliant mind? 

Yeah, I can't wait until this period of right wing fascism is over. I get nostalgic for the days of 2008 where we all naively thought racism was solved.

978,Basically have no family left,"I have debated posting here for several weeks now but at this point I just have to vent. Not looking for answers because tbh there aren't any. But I just feel so frustrated and so much despair and have no outlet for it. 

I will preface this by saying myself and my nuclear family have never been close. My parents were horribly abusive when i was young and my only sister is basically a mini-me of my mom. I moved out like a thief in the night 3 days after I turned 18 and never went back. For the last 9 years I have lived out of state and only visited once or twice a year, and when I do I stay with my grandma. My parents and sister have made efforts to varying degrees over the years to reconcile, but I've never received an apology and have struggled with that basically since I left. 

2015 rolls around and I become basically shocked that both my parents are trumpers. My sister is not and my grandma is not. Over the following years my relationship with my parents became even more strained. And now, this year, I find out through my grandma that they are full blown Q. Like, to the point my dad rants and raves to strangers in public about it. My mom and sister ""aren't as bad"" my grandma claims, but any level of trumpism or Q is bad enough. I'm almost grateful to have the excuse of a pandemic to have not visited since Christmas 2019 because I honestly don't even know how I could deal with them. My mom has been texting me more as of recently but I've figured out it is simply her trying to get me to join them in their bullshit beliefs. It is both infuriating and depressing as hell. 

My family is very small. It consists of my nuclear family and my grandma, at this point. I am not married and have no children (without a desire for either if im being honest with myself). When my grandma passes, most likely in the next few years, they will be the literal only family I have in the world. And because of that, I basically will be alone because even if they woke up tomorrow morning and were like, ""oops our bad, that shit was crazy and we were wrong"" I wouldn't even care. Fuck that! The vile and horrible shit they have said and done, combined with the utter stupidity they have displayed by falling for this bullshit, has made me lose any ounce of respect I ever had for them as well as any interest in reconciliation.

990,"Sister has suddenly started caring a lot about ""togetherness"" and ""birthdays"" ever since last March...","I apologize for coming here to rant. I'm just feeling a lot of things right now. Angry. Frustrated. Tired. I'm showing my sister my better side, but the bad side has to go somewhere. Let's keep this short: I have lived two-and-a-half hours away from my family for like seven or eight years. We never visit for birthdays, except  like a 21st birthday or something, but we all send cards and gifts. We visit for Thanksgiving and Xmas. Sometimes my fiancee and I visit the family for a weekend or so. Nobody visits us.

Last year when covid hit my sister immediately became an anti-masker. I was not aware of this at first. What I WAS aware of was that suddenly my sister started really pushing for everybody to ""go on a trip for her birthday"". This was two months after lockdown started. I said no, definitely not. My brother said no. My mom said yes but cancelled after we both said no. My sister was apparently super crushed and still wanted to have some kind of gathering. I felt bad for her because, at the time, I wasn't suspicious that this was all about covid denial. So I reluctantly agreed to make a day trip to see them, just my family, no outings otherwise, on her birthday. At the time my fiancee was working from home, and I was working but with a very limited number of people (see: two). I also had the ability to take appropriate days off to ensure I wasn't going to spread anything. I was checked for symptoms twice a day at work, and I wore a mask. There were only about 12 cases of recognized covid in town. I felt guilty, but went to her birthday because it was important to her and I was able to take a lot of precautions.

On her birthday I found out she was an antimasker. Because it was her birthday, I did not push the issue.

Then in September, she decides to throw my brother a ""surprise birthday party"". If there's anyone who has a more complicated relationship than her and me, it's her and him. She would never, EVER throw him a party. Also, she like...doesn't throw parties. Our mom does. My sister arranging the party was really weird. I declined. My brother would not have come, but my mom invited him over and...surprise! A bunch of people! To spread germs! Yay!

Thanksgiving came. I declined. My sister decided to travel to Palm Springs with her boyfriend and his family...on a plane...during covid. But before she left she made sure to text me and ask me my plans. I said no, I was not going, my dad is nearly 70 and my sister lives with him and if he died because of me I could never forgive myself. She said, ""Well, you never know, these family occasions are important because he may not make it to next year!"". Then she flew to Palm Springs and spent the holiday without our dad. My mom got pizza and ate it with my dad and my brother. I had store-bought chicken with my fiancee and we managed to have a nice time.

Xmas came. I made my second exception to see them that year. I was nervous, but I missed them so much.

My birthday came and went with well wishes, gifts, and no visitations. My mom got her vaccine and my sister stopped talking to her for two weeks.

Now, today, she tells me she's ""throwing a surprise birthday for mom""! And gee, wouldn't I love to take a day off work and have my fiancee take a day off work and drive two-and-a-half hours during a plague to come celebrate a birthday we have literally never had a party for before? Not to mention my workplace is no longer safe. I am exposed to dozens of people a day. People fucking take their masks off to talk to me all the time and I have to ask them to put it back on....while still in the store. I work with like six people plus the public. My risk factor is much higher. So I tell her no in the most polite way I can. ""I have a wedding coming up this year and I need to save my vacation days for the bridal party and honeymoon"". We will be having the wedding in her city, so I will need time off. This is a valid excuse, especially since I work for a small business, have worked there less than a year, and haven't really been there long enough to justify crippling the staff whenever I want for whatever reason.

Then she says, ""wait what about MY birthday?""

At this point I'm hearing the theme from the Omen playing somewhere in the background. I am damn sure by this point that the parties she's throwing are an excuse to flout social distancing, even if they're in the rules. (I mean, there's going to be like five or six people there.) Then she texts me that ""it just made her so happy to have me there last year and it would mean the world to her if I could come"". So I tell her sure, I'll make an exception for her birthday, but not mom's. My mom will understand. My sister will not. Then she pushes the issue. ""Where I worked you could just ask for days off in advance but I understand"". 

So I tell her as gently as I can, ""I work for a small business and I have been here less than a year. Also my fiancee will have to take time off to get me there. If I lived near you and there was no covid I would visit all of you every birthday"". Then she gets mad saying I should have just told her I was worried about covid. Then she tells me to ""stay safe from the boogeyman"".

I just can't anymore. She keeps asking me to take risks because she ""loves me so much"", but then lashes out when I tell her that I believe in protecting her even if it means I'm being tricked. I have never felt less loved. I have never felt so much like all of our interactions are just manipulation. I told my brother, she used to be just unpleasant, but now I can no longer talk to her without feeling like she's fucking lying or using me for something.

I think I have lost the ability to think of her as poor and misled. She's not respectful. She's not loving. She's malicious. Fuck Q, fuck covispiracy, fuck her.

TLDR: My sister who has never cared about family events (and clearly still doesn't after she skipped Thanksgiving to travel during covid) has been constantly throwing parties for family birthdays and I have to keep declining them. She has never arranged a party for anyone before. She insulted me for telling her no because of covid. I no longer trust her.",QAnonCasualties

992,[Advice Needed] I think my mom has quietly fallen into the Qhole,"Hello, everyone! First time poster, and I‚Äôm really new to anything related to QAnon, so please bear with me and correct me as needed.

Background: my mom has always been Republican and conservative, and I used to be until I got out on my own and was able to form my own opinions. She and I have butt heads over politics and policies, but have remained pretty civil, until the coronavirus started making its way to America early-2020.

It started out as little comments here and there, about how it was ‚Äújust a flu‚Äù and how ‚Äúmasks aren‚Äôt even that effective‚Äù to now she acts like someone is holding a gun to her head every time she has to put a mask on. She also gave me the longest side-eye look when I told her I‚Äôd gotten the first round of the vaccine. She‚Äôs not totally anti-vax, but she also hasn‚Äôt had a flu shot in ten years, so.

This weird ‚Äúsuddenly worsened‚Äù trope also went towards her religion. I consider myself more agnostic than anything, but over the last five years she‚Äôs just THROWN herself into The Lord. Which, y‚Äôknow, whatever, but when I was first telling her about my now-ex-partner, her first question was ‚Äú[are they] a Christian?‚Äù Not their name, where they‚Äôre from, what they do, no. Their religious beliefs. I gave her a non-answer, and she replied with, ‚Äúas long as [they‚Äôre] not a Muslim‚Äù (with THAT pronunciation) and I was just flabbergasted. She also made the off-handed comment this past weekend that ‚Äúmaybe Princess Diana‚Äôs death was a ‚ÄòGod-Thing‚Äô, because she was getting involved with that Muslim guy.‚Äù

But, honestly, emotional-dumping aside, what I really need advice on is this new bullshit she‚Äôs doing. Recently, Biden signed an Executive Order that went over climate change and his plans on helping to fix it/slow it down. Somewhere in that order was something about China. And I‚Äôm not being vague on purpose, because which EO and which part of it is where I get tripped up, BUT. To the best that I have been able to figure out, through a right-wing publication, China supposedly now has control of the US‚Äôs electric grid. And she is CONVINCED that the Chinese government is gonna give us a national blackout and brick all of our tech. She has this elaborate plan on coming to get me in her husband‚Äôs truck (which is older than most, so it doesn‚Äôt rely on a computer) and she‚Äôs been slowly stocking up on cans and dog food. She didn‚Äôt even go this far when we went through both Ike and Harvey.

I guess, my biggest concern is, how do I gently break it to her that she‚Äôs gone off the deep end? Or at least dipping her legs into it. I‚Äôve tried before hinting to her that I‚Äôm tired of people blindly following articles without doing any proper vetting or research, but she only did so for a week. And please, if someone can figure out which EO she‚Äôs talking about, I will be grateful. It breaks my heart to see her like this, truly. I just want my rational mom back.

I know exactly how ""losing everything"" feels, because it happened to me.

That's WHY I care so passionately about the right to health care.

That's WHY I think food stamps and Section 8 are so important.

That's WHY I think unemployment needs to last longer and lose its stigma.

That's WHY I think bankruptcies should feel less punitive and oppose ""strategic bankruptcy.""

That's WHY I want people to know that Disability isn't easy to get, but difficult.

That's WHY I think the average wage needs to increase.

That's WHY I resent wealthy people and businesses that evade taxes.

That's WHY I believe the US is in need of a safety net comparable to that in other wealthy nations.

That's WHY I think Americans need to develop empathy for others, realizing that virtually anyone can be financially devastated by events they cannot control.¬†

996,My 3 y/o niece has nightmares about being cannibalized,"So most of my in-laws are pretty deep into the Qult and conspiracy theories more generally. Right now, the crown jewel of that side of the family is my 3-year-old niece who is an absolutely incredible kid--very bright and personable. During a recent visit, however, I learned that she has nightmares of being eaten by Joe Biden. Notably, she does not know who Joe Biden is, nor can she identify him. But *someone* has obviously been filling her head with this nonsense to the point that it has invaded her dreams and occupies her thoughts almost daily. I've brought this up to my BIL/SIL and pointed out that this is a super-not-normal thing for a 3-year-old to dream about or obsess over, but I just get the ol' shrug-a-roonie. Honestly, I don't expect that they're the ones talking about this bullshit with her--it's most likely her dipshit FIL who could teach a fucking masterclass in traumatizing children, and who WILL NOT EVER SHUT UP ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES. The man is Trump without the money or (thankfully) the sexual assault.

I don't know why I'm making this post, really, I just wanted to vent about it, I guess. In all likelihood, I'll be cutting off most contact with that side of the family indefinitely for reasons that go way beyond Q.

  Over the last 4 years my wife‚Äôs parents have gone from amazing members of the community and people I looked up to to being Qanon faithfuls and scary. I don‚Äôt really know how to approach the situation. 

  My wife and I share mainly the same beliefs and are on the same political spectrum. The issue is we both deeply love her parents but they are becoming more and more of a worry for us and their influence on my kids. 

  Currently they watch my 3 year old in the afternoons and we are worried she will start taking what they talk about and learning around it. I know in my life my grandparents were way more influential than my parents. 

  I want to ask them to stop and be respectful of our views as we are with theirs but knowing my father in law that won‚Äôt take that well. They are very closed and are deep into some of the most outrageous things I‚Äôve seen so reason and sense is probably too far gone.

999,The tightrope we walk out of love,"Hello all.  I‚Äôm so glad to see this subreddit for support in such a real issue we are facing. I take comfort in the fact that I‚Äôm not alone in my struggle, though I‚Äôm saddened by how deeply this has impacted our nation that we should need this for solace. I post this not looking for advice, as I believe this is a personal matter and one, as I love him dearly, only I can address. I do hope that by saying things things I might gain mastery over my feelings and maybe even encourage someone else who reads this. 

I grew up in the south, was educated there, and left to gain new perspective.  I never really considered myself a part of any party but I certainly saw myself in the sways of their rhetorics at times. Mostly though, I just never saw enough from the lot to believe this system of government we have to be all that effective (likely a byproduct of capitalism but really not germane to the topic at hand). My father in all of this always taught me to vote for the person not the party and to keep on trying even if you don‚Äôt get the result you hopped. When we result to apathy the system no longer represents us. We always had splendid conversations about government and politics and he brought me up to put value in having a set of moral beliefs.  My father was at all times love and never put his needs before mine. 

Ever since my leaving, I‚Äôve noticed a shift in him (and maybe one that has encompassed my long-time once home). A shift that is clearly not isolated and one that has brought me here, reading your testimonies. I, like so many of you, have discussed to the point of losing my temper to no avail and begetting only self defeat. My heart aches and I am tired. 

We have a child now, and this makes my burden all the harder as I want her growing up knowing the man that raised me in love.  I walk a narrow path and should I stray to one side I am lost in the anger and lies of those that find it much easier to escape their freedom by yielding it to those so willing to control them at what ever cost in fascistic splendor. To the other I face the forever separation of the one I hold dear.   I cannot quit my walk down this road though it‚Äôs easy to want to throw my hands up and cry out this was his doing not mine. Doing so has its own price to pay. If it were an abusive situation it would be all the easier, but the reality is my father is lost and I‚Äôd want my all to see him safely home. I‚Äôve weighed and measured my codependency in the matter. I‚Äôve certainly talked it over times untold with my spouse and cherished friends. What‚Äôs left is to walk on in this lonely night and keep hoping for the glimmer of a rising sun. 

In a time now where facts carry no more weight, I can only reason love as my only reaming tool.  

Thank you for letting me get this off my chest, and thank you for this group where we can share. I‚Äôm sorry I cannot provide any advice to others as much as I cannot say my choice is the right one for anyone else here. Know I care about you all and that I hope we can find peace one day in our struggles.",QAnonCasualties
