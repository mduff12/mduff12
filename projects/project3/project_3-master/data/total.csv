0,Does tictock listen to you?,"I’m not no expert on conspiracy theories but I’ve come to notice something strange about the popular social media app “Tictok”.

The other day I was scrolling through the app just watching videos but I realize that most of the videos I was watching were really related to what goes on in my life. For example me and my friend were in class together and we were talking about a car later that day I was on tictok and I saw a video of that exact car. I’ve talked to many about this phenomenon and they say that they have noticed the same thing thing.

This leads me to believe that the app may be listening to your conversations and it relays it back into a tictok. Has anyone else noticed this?",conspiracy

Farm wars

I can see it all now; brains uploaded onto a chip and into a machine built by a machine that was built by a man. A man who may have had too much to drink the night before and ooopsie! Oh, well, mistakes happen. Then downloaded into another machine built by a machine that was programmed by the guy who appears normal on the surface, but secretly likes to test the boundaries and see what he can get away with, or the newly graduated student of We Churn ‘em out Quick and Charge a Bundle University who relied on her classmates to carry her through. She can’t add without a calculator and removing both of her Reeboks, but hey, who notices nowadays?

And there you are in all your undead glory, stuffed into a computerized machine that only needs minimal  upkeep every now and then; a change of oil, bit of grease, new filter, and away you go for another year or so. You can hit ‘pause’ and take a break, but you’d better remember to set the timer or you’re asleep indefinitely. Aaaahhhhh, but we will be sentient machines you say. Uh huh.

A soft, humanlike machine is still a machine. Thoughts may be recorded on a chip, but not as anything remotely resembling the soul that uttered them.

So, I really hate to break it to those who think that they are destined to live forever in a body of their own design, but anything that man makes is imperfect because man is imperfect. The glorious future that you envision of everlasting man-made life encased in a shell of materials designed to host circuits and computer chips is not a viable reality. There will be no consciousness in that soulless vehicle. At least not one that can be recognized. And if by some miracle your spirit could be entrapped in a mortal boundary created by toddlers weaned off Windows 8, that would be everlasting life in hell, and nothing to really look forward to.

We’ve already got kids running around with blue hair and pink tattoos, and so much metal attached to their bodies that if a magnet is anywhere near their vicinity, they stand a good chance of flying through the air to meet it. So, it’s not a big stretch. Man melds with machine. Man becomes machine. Man makes it all up and can become anything he wants. Only it will never be without flaws. Ever.

I can see it now… It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s a…. what in the hell is that, anyway? Oh! Not to worry, it’s just Fred down the road. He wanted to increase his sex drive and thought some rabbit DNA would fit the bill so he got some transgenes injected into his artificial body and not only can he hump like a bunny now without Viagra, but sports a nice tail, a few extra whiskers, and his ears are a tad long. Too bad he can’t feel anything from the waist down without taking 34 pills a day to keep his artificial nervous system functioning at 85% of normal…

Aaaaahhh, transhumanism and life without boundaries. Well, almost…

I’m so sick and tired of these transhumanist apostles, with their artificial intelligence schemas that they think will “revolutionize” humanity and bump it up to it’s next inevitable and heroic level. Even the weird kid with his blowup doll, knew that his plastic “girlfriend” wasn’t really an actual woman. Are we now so addled, so besotted with chemtrails, gmos, fluoridated water, and toxic vaccines, that we now believe that robots, no matter how seemingly lifelike, are actually human. And that we can somehow “upload” our consciousness into a silicon and titanium simulacrum and pretend that it, and us, are now somehow immortal, wow. Is there some supernal power that effects this transmogrification, some Golem like uplifting that miraculously bestows life to the lifeless. Some arcane power of mind, as yet untapped. Well no, not exactly. You see, it’s an old, old power. The power of wishful thinking, or possibly the power of (yikes) insanity. But hey, I can understand the power of an overactive imagination, the power of a fevered brain. Heck yeah, it’s alright, if you want to be the wooden dummy that thinks it’s alive and can talk, that’s fine with me. I’ll be your EDGAR BERGEN, if you’ll be my MORTIMER SNERD.

""On Black Friday 2015, a viral epidemic, transmitted by a virus planted on banknotes, sweeps through New York City. The disease, known as ""The Dollar Flu"", causes widespread chaos, and major cities are placed under quarantine. The U.S. Government activates sleeper agents in the population who operate for the Strategic Homeland Division, or simply ""the Division"", to assist emergency responders and National Guardsmen, and the Joint Task Force (JTF), in restoring order. In Brooklyn, the protagonist, a Division agent, assists the JTF before planning to depart for the Quarantine zone with fellow agent Faye Lau. However, the VTOL meant to take them there is destroyed in an explosion, killing the Division Commander along with most of the second wave and severely wounding Faye Lau. Arriving in a JTF-commandeered news helicopter instead, the Division agents reclaim the James A. Farley Post Office Building as their base of operations. From there, the agents undertake assignments to rescue important personnel, help in restoring the base of operations to full working capacity and combat criminal groups, such as the Rioters, common street thugs in New York who generally want to take advantage of the quarantine; the Rikers, escapees from Rikers Island; and the Cleaners, insane New York Sanitation workers who wield flamethrowers and believe everyone is infected.""",conspiracy

My comments literally only spoke of my skepticism of the covid vaccines out to market atm, in terms of their known/unknown side effects. Didn't even have a political angle to it. I was simply raising the reasonable, valid, and readily verifiable point of fact that these vaccines were produced in record time (insofar as vaccine research and testing goes). I pointed out vaccines take years and years to work the kinks out. These are simply scientific facts.

66,Simian Virus #40 - The pandemics true specter,"I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice. I'll let history vindicate me.   
In 1959, the [Poliovirus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9776239/) vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk and inoculated to nearly a hundred million Americans was discovered to be contaminated by a then unknown virus. The Macacus monkey's renal cells that were used to create the vaccines were found to have a new type of virus called a Polyomavirus, and this strain would be called Simian Virus number 40. However, the difficult to detect, yet virulent ability to infect humans through blood, urine, spit, and feces, as well as passed down from mother to child, resulted in one of the largest scandals history hardly mentions. Studies in the 1970's that actively infected participants through oral ingestion found that SV40 infections were relatively quick, with viral shedding being visible within the firth 3-4 days in fecal matter. Poliovirus vaccines from the 1960's in south America were also discovered to have been contaminated with SV40, however, researchers in 2019 discovered that the seroprevalence of SV40 in south American populations were around 12 and 22%(based on populace in [Nicaragua and Columbia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6544904/)), and upwards of 36% among sex workers.   


It wouldn't be until [2003 that a congressional committee](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-108hhrg92772/html/CHRG-108hhrg92772.htm) would confirm the FDA's awareness of an outbreak of SV40 in the population(and the ghastly realization that they had no clue how many have it), and the reality that the pharmaceutical companies had bribed a medical scientist to skew data on SV40 in order to hide the reality that it was to blame for the rise in mesothelioma, and that the transmission from infected mother to child was a factor in the rising numbers of brain cancer in children. It was so damning, not a single pharmaceutical representative showed. In 2004, it was released that SV40 was directly linked to [tumors and mesothelioma](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9776243/), due to the virus's ability to latch onto DNA and suppress the p53 gene that are responsible for cell apoptosis, aka, cell death. Research on this inhibition of the p53 has been utilized over the past decade in order to create 'immortal cells', many of which show mutation and cell swelling.   


Recently, it has been understood that the p53 gene is responsible for limiting the [Covid-19 virus](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/35/E5192) from replicating, yet research couldn't explain how the p53 would be inhibited in order to facilitate such rapid replication of the coronavirus to result in a SARS condition leading to respiratory failure.  The 'vaccines' that many pharmaceutical companies are selling are only intended to block the corona virus from being able to replicate inside the body. This does nothing to stop the larger SV40 endemic that is the true spectre causing this pandemic.",conspiracy

I think this conspiracy to condemn masturbation is propagated by many churches and preached to the public because men are to afraid to be honest with their wives about what they need to do in order to prevent themselves from falling in to temptation. I think exposing this lie will help solve a lot of men's sexual confusion and prevent actually sinful things, like rape, from occurring.

If it was made clear to people that masturbation isn't a sin, I think the world would be a tad bit better of a place to live. Stop this silent conspiracy and bring forth the truth.

They watch the news, without a real clue,
About what the media is really trying to do. 

Their fear tactics keep us pinned in place,
These masks keep our identities erased. 

The graphs charts and data keep us glued to the screen,
While behind the curtains there are far more gruesome things. 

They test our boundaries to see how far we will go,
Because if people aren’t complicit then they’ve lost control.

So they scare us into following their mandates and codes,
If we continue to obey, they’ll continue to impose. 

The people wave their flags, red white and blue,
But they don’t have a real clue,
About what our government is really trying to do.

Therefore, we can conclude based on the bible that the devil is not, in fact, sinful. My own conclusion is that he is evil, and does evil, but he is fulfilling the mandate that God created him for. Angels do not have free will (we see in the bible that angels, demons, and even satan have no choice but to obey the orders of God and Jesus), the devil is/was an angel, therefore he is just doing what God created him to do or commanded him to do.

146,Bruising of the Left Eye,"Hi everyone I just saw a post about how the worlds elite all have their left eye bruised, which presumably means they are in some sort of “secret club”.
Here’s a [photo ](https://i.4pcdn.org/x/1470240309775.jpg)as an example.

In my opinion this is done to initiate a member into secrets of our universe and beyond Earth knowledge, while keeping the rest of us in the dark and under control. 

In meditation, the third eye appears as a *reflection* of the left eye, and is violet/ purple colored. The third eye is a gateway to a higher understanding, which once again the 1% knows of this you can see it everywhere especially on the back of the $1 bill. 

Check out my short [blog](https://energywavesymptom.blogspot.com/2021/01/the-inner-eye.html), it demonstrates that there is in fact a God or higher power out there because it shows us that we are designed. 

So to recap, the 1% knows about the existence of a God or higher power, and uses it to keep the rest of us in the “caves”. 

I just recently read about the Vril parasite, and how it also may be the cause of bruising; however I’m not too familiar with the theory. 

In my opinion, the reflection of the third eye during meditation is a more likely the case because it also sometimes appears in a prism, and Egyptians are known for their pyramids. I guess both theories match up quite well.

Anyways does anybody have more information about the Vril parasite? And in know for certain there is a God or higher power out there because we are designed. Thanks looking forward to your comments.",conspiracy

That way you can educate your children the way people in your community want, not some federal institution. 4th. Become self reliant and build your local community. Work together to build farms and make products. Lastly. Turn off your phone and the news. You will see how much people really love one another and want to help each other no matter where they come from. The best way to take away from the rich is not to give them a dime.

But any other time, economic measurements are not indicative of the quality of life, according to those same people.

174,"When did the term ""skeptic"" become synonymous with ""dismissive to anything outside the mainstream narrative""?","Im well aware of when/how the term ""conspiracy theory"" was born.  And I personally take no qualm with the term.  I find nothing upsetting about saying that I believe people will conspire to achieve a goal, and theorizing why or how.  I can entertain an idea without being wholly invested in it, or even entirely believing it.

But when did ""skeptic"" come to mean ""supporter of the mainstream narrative"".  If anything, I believe ""conspiracy theorist"" is more synonymous with skepticism.  

Even in Oxford Dictionary, a skeptic is defined as ""a person inclined to question or doubt accepted opinions"". But I know so many people who claim to be skeptics while actively and closemindedly dismissing anything outside of the mainstream or not in popular media.  The contradiction is even given legitimacy by the term being tied to career-debunkers or narrative supporters like Michael Shermer (Skeptics Magazine and The Skeptics Society) or Brian Dunning (author and host of Skeptoid).

Ive listened to those 2 and many like them several times, and they act more like defense attorneys using fallacies than people sincerely and objectively questioning and investigating.

260,New Earth BIG new info,"There is a lot of information about the New Earth I have found and pieced together. (Relates to the New world order)

We changed our calendar system multiple times over millennia resulting in the loss of years. The country Ethiopia STILL uses the ancient Coptic calendar though, for them its 2013, for us its 2021.

This means 2012 was in 2020, the 'Christmas star' happened on 21st December 2020 which is the EXACT same date the Maya said …

The Hopi who lived among the Mayans prophesised the new era begins when the 'Blue Kachina star' comes. This could be that star

The Maya never stated the end of the calendar would signal the end of the world, but the Hopi who they lived among did prophecies a purification of the planet would happen among the coming of the new world which we just entered

Now if you look at the site in which the Maya stuff relating to the 13th Baktun on the Mesoamerican calendar were found it is literally called ""la corona""

Corona = body part resembling a crown, so crown virus. This corresponds to the crown chakra from spirituality which is essentially a energy centre of universal knowledge and spiritualism. 

This is interesting because most ancient prophecies such as the Tibetan prophecy, Hermetic, Hopi all state the cause of the coming events is due to a collective disconnection from spirit

The universal mind expresses itself through symbolism archetypes and synchronicity, the name correspondences aren't a coincidence. 

The Queen literally mentioned ""The New Dawn"" in one of her recent speeches

There is SOOOOO much more information, relating to aliens, the nature of space, war, metaphysical PROOF of certain things happening on the planet right now. The information is really important. I've made a video compiling the most important information together, here it is:

You can do the math for yourself to figure out the death rates of specific age groups.  

For shits and giggles, here’s how it looks for people aged 18-29:

4,816,779 cases have been reported.

1747 deaths have been reported.

313,Mass Gofundme Operation: Gov't Cuomo Edition: Taking back the power; Throwing shit at the wall.,"This thought just popped into my head replying to another post regarding Gov't Cuomo's lawsuit debacle. 

This isn't to bash Cuomo but to exploit the unchallenged loop holes these government figures take advantage of. 

When it comes to Cuomo he was faced with two options which lead to these cases being a perfect example. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current Situation:

&amp;#x200B;

Lawsuit 1:Negligence

\- Thousands of angry family members filing lawsuits on behalf of their deceased loved ones.

\- Historical lawsuit amounts to be  to the families. re-evaluation of policies. 

\- Thousands of convictions. 

\- Failed at protecting the people he was elected to protect.

\- Career ending.

&amp;#x200B;

Lawsuit 2:Negligence

\- One individual for excessive touching.

\- One lawsuit to be payable to one.

\- One conviction.

\- Opportunity to remain Gov't.

\- Leaves next agenda opportunity open with time availability.

&amp;#x200B;

Where does the money come from for lawsuits in Govt?

\- YOUR money (Taxpayers).

&amp;#x200B;

TIME FOR GOFUNDME:

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've witnessed Gofundme work in many ways:

\- Individuals donate their own money to support someone's cause.

\- Recipients after goal is raised withdrawls funds and pays a percentage to Gofundme for using their platform.

\- Countless cases on Godfundme raising $500,000 or more. 

\- Most individuals reach a realistic goal and ""go on with their life.""-(Our mission)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE POST\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\- I've noticed over time that if people accept the Gofundme payout it appears their lawsuits go away.

\- Like choosing one pay out(Gofundme) or the other (Court System).

\- I have no knowledge of how that works but Gofundme having a clause in place to restrict double dipping just seems common sense.

&amp;#x200B;

THE Plan:

\- We can attempt to take control back or even aggressively shake up the current situation.

\- Just like with GameStop they used the market against themselves.

\- Raise money for this girl on Gofundme.

\- She will then be forced with choosing the money or continuing lawsuit on Cuomo.

\- This plan in itself will reveal the agenda.

\- This plan itself will mix things up in a big way.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

\- This female has been implemented in an agenda to overshadow the lawsuits filed on behalf of the deceased nursing home family members.

\- Girl wants justice from Cuomo for negligence.

\- Give her a couple hundred thousand for her troubles.

\- She refuses gofundme payout, she in with the agenda.

\- She takes payout which makes her go away.

\- MSM will then need to scramble to find another replacement story to over-shadow the Nursing home debacle.

\- All and all your tax paying money is spent on these MSM stories regarding govt officials.

\- Take back control of your money and how its spent.",conspiracy

My bosses were like your not in trouble but you were listed as a Witness with Alex (who was the guy pissed X person off). Do you remember the time and Date? I’m like Hell no I just woke up. I asked them who was it with and what was said so it can trigger my memory and they were like ya were not allowed to tell you. Because of “privacy”. But you listed me as a witness. If I have more details I could fill in the blanks. I don’t doubt that I was a witness but because of my nature I don’t find shit offensive. I have very thick skin. Thought about it all day and literally nothing came to mind. Must not be that offensive if you can’t tell me who the “victim” was. I’m willing to bet he said something I laughed at then walked away. My bosses were like so has Alex ever said anything sexual to you? I’m like ya. We’re guys. And I should add I live in NY.

Literally everything is offensive to people these days. 

&gt; A second former aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is accusing him of sexual harassment, saying that he asked her questions about her sex life, whether she was monogamous in her relationships and if she had ever had sex with older men. Mr. Cuomo never tried to touch her, Ms. Bennett said, but the message of the entire episode was unmistakable to her.

No touch = No sexual harassment. Touch = Sexual Harassment. If anything it’s her fault for not telling him to back off. 

I’m no Cuomo Supporter. What I am is a Straight white man whose consistent. I defended Kavanaugh and Trump because it’s all Political. With Trump everyone knew he was a playboy. Dude bragged about his exploits for years. And he did it when he was a private citizen. Notice how no Female White House Staffers made Sexual Harassment /Assault claims while he was President? 

Yet with Kavanaugh it got vicious. They tried to destroy his Life with a Woman who he never met. Ford couldn’t even remember the 5 w’s. Who, what, when, where, and why. And yet this was Democrats best (fake) “witness” chance to stop him. 

Meanwhile with Democrats you had Clinton with the Blue Cum Stained dress, and Biden sexually touching minors on Camera. Democrats allow the real predators to skate free yet focus on these nothing burgers with Cuomo asking questions about a woman personal life to gain info to see if she’s interested. Why am I confident about this? Because I as a straight white man use the same tactics. Why is it wrong to gain information to see what people and what type of man they like? 

If asking questions is Sexual Harassment then all straight men is guilty of Sexual Harassment. It pains me to defend Cuomo. Because these claims are such a obvious attempt to distract from him murdering old people. And yet straight men from the Elite down to us Peasants are getting in trouble for dumb shit that’s a waste of peoples time.",conspiracy

370,Rich people want virus to spread?,"Whole covid thing doesn't sit right. Feels like 9/11 did: facts don't add up.

Rich people/ruling class want covid to spread?
-Is a lab made virus: either it escaped or was created &amp; planted to look like it escaped. You don't weld people into their apartments as they did in China unless it's the real deal or you're trolling the west.
-Decrease population = more time to reach sustainability
-always having new strains = perpetual control of people
-allows us to test &amp; bring out new medical tech (mRNA vaccines)
-govts aren't really trying to stop it (no rapid-tests, no paying people to stay home if they have covid, mask theater, hygiene theater, minimal extra $ sent to firms researching actual solutions, I bet we gave more to airlines than we did to biomedical startups in 2020.)
-U.S. intel controls big tech and the media.
-virus allows big tech to clamp down on free-speech, brand domestic skeptics as terrorists, complete narrative control. (Note ISIS is back now that Biden is back?)
-more monitoring of citizens, need a vaccine passport to get takeout food. lol.
-adversity of the virus divides people: look at China vs. US rhetoric or just mask vs no mask. Divided people are easy to control, so are people that are stuck at home.
-Moves towards acceptance of trans-humanism: wouldn't you accept altered DNA if the other option was forever-lockdown?
-breaks an already struggling education system. (who knows what will replace it, probably stronger indoctrination? Maybe better education? hah.)
-end of retail work / many service jobs now that we're talking about 'endemic' covid. U.S. Manufacturing is constrained by having smart people who show up; they need bodies.
-deflation from a terrible economy allows for big loans bringing future value to the present and giving policy makers capital to put towards 'innovation.'  Or just their friends? Staves off $ collapse?

My conspiracy theory that I personally have been wondering about and haven't seen mentioned:

-&gt; 10% of people are getting long haul covid. Look it up, no joke. Bad deal. Long covid matches CFS, has been around a while now. Various ailments matching covid have been around for years.

-&gt; US has been experimenting with bio-weapons for a long time, other govts are sure to be also chasing bio weapons. 

-&gt; It's now easier than ever to do this sort of biology in your garage, even small countries can afford a bio lab. 

-&gt; Here's the leap: Weapons labs have been quietly spreading viruses to 'enemy' countries to hamper important companies, take out leaders, etc...

-&gt; If they've been screwing with 'enemies' then weapons labs have been sending viruses to their own county to inoculate their own populations. Getting one virus can give you immunity to another virus, don't require vaccines. People who are asymptomatic covid got a de-powered version of the virus, or just lucked out and had a version that worked ok with their DNA.

-&gt; US FDA haven't approved universal rapid-tests because they want covid to spread. That's why we don't pay people to stay home if they have covid, &amp; why we aren't doing a serious lockdown &amp; why we're all over the map on masks.

-&gt; Everyone will always need the newest booster shot to fight the next 'new strain' which is lab derived &amp; let loose by either our own labs or someone else. (aliens!!!)

The EU is set to declare war on encryption  
from WWI conspiracy to incoming Iran war - same bullshitters and spiners, same tricks  
Modern part of the Game’s history  
As depicted, Goyi Go has been played globaly forever, with same common brainfuck in all  
parts of the world. This time, let’s look into its intricacies and evolution within EU game world.  
Agenda has been pushing into poor EU members for decades in order to control the area. This was also a reason why those states were allowed entry into EU, even though it was obvious that within EU &amp; Euro they would never catch up. Having monetary autonomy was critical tool for their economies within global society, but that was taken away. In return, they got access to EU development funds, which were actually used for hostile takeover through intentional corruption.  
But even decades before that step, »former« USA marines with Nazi inclinations were systematically being send on this area. Some as returning expats, some on various exchange programs and  manufactured jobs etc. They were directed by higher levels – staff from embassies, diplomats,  
various NATO exchange and coooperative programs etc. Plenty of civilians  came from Israel.   
Common denominator of all these »game tokens« is that they all had a dual role – official  and covert  
one.   
Typical tokens with dual roles:

* ambassadors, coordinating traffic, advancement of their tokens under their hierarchical position, acquisiton of new tokens and data and reporting upwards former politicians, soldiers, ambassadors etc that have suddenly developed	a »love for the country« and sent themselves on extensive tours, gathering data to sell to the network and prove their value.
* expats, 	returning form USA etc and getting jobs in military, police,»security« companies etc.
* businessmen with shady paths within USA that have suddenly remembered their family roots and decided to share some of their »wisdom« with their birth place.
* members of non-public societies and movements, like Fremasons etcetc. These tend to be invited either as public fassade or for their already established societal position (bankers, influential politicians etc).

Since Goyi Go is not uniform game by any means, knowledge of the terrain and population was essential. This is where those tokens were used mostly – to scan the terrain and social fabric and propagate information for further processing.  
Most of the goals in that phase was network growth and for this, they needed vital information about cooperative elements as well as weak spots for new targets. Trivial example, underpaid, disgruntled psycho cop. Or a judge with a gambling problem. Or a kid with a drug problem, or a drunk doctor that botched some case etc.

What is less visible  
form the top layers of hierarchy is that th  
is rot has used  
gornmental infrastructure and its EVERY asset to spread as deep into  
sicietal infrastructure as possible.",conspiracy
392,"Are there people here who truly, truly fear that going out in public will allow you to get the virus and then die? Like this is an actual emotional state you are in when in public, literally fearing death?","Not sure why it took my so long, but when trying to rationalize why so many people will willing participate in dehumanizing measures, at their own and loved ones expense, it finally hit me that there are people out there that truly believe they could die by going out in the public. 

They can also fear that they themselves can pick something up and literally kill loved ones with their presence. 

It’s such a terrible way to live, and is an emotional state projected upon you by people who want to make money. 

I know most of you cling to and advertise the success of allopathic medicine within the germ theory paradigm to receive social/societal rewards, but if you truly want to live a life free of irrational fear, break free of the germ theory. 

“Disease” is literally the conflict active or and primarily the healing phase of a tissue adaptation your body underwent. Tissue adapatations can stem from only four things:

Injury
Poison 
Malnutrition
Specific biological special programs

The first three are obvious

The last one should be, but is completely hidden from modern medicine, and is so for good reason. 

Biological special programs are seen in nature on every level of existence. These programs have been developed over the entirety of life, and allow for all organisms to adapt to stimuli instantaneously to increase likelihood of survival. 

What triggers these biological special processes are a specifc, highly acute, completely unexpected, shock which is registered across the psyche, brain and body simultaneously. 

Once the shock has happened, depending on how it was perceived, tissue augmentation will begin immidiatly in the area that is associated with the shock in both the brain and body. 

For example, if a mother bear sees her cub get injured, it will trigger a response in the brain and body that starts the proliferation of breast cells, that will allow for more nutrients and more milk to be released to aid the cub. 

As humans, these biological processes are still present. And due to our understanding of language and symbols, we can transmute non biological issues into biological issues, if the conflict is shocking enough. 

So if you take the above example, if a woman sees her young child get hit by a car, this will illicit the same response. The proliferation of breast tissue to aid the child with increased milk and nutrients. However, this still happens even if the woman is not currently breast feeding. It’s an inherent evolutionary biological response. 

But modern medicine, will negate this entire process, and when the woman goes to the doctor, may be diagnosed with breast cancer to the growth in breast tissue. 

Then starts the money sucking “cure” process. 

It should also be noted that the shock of the cancer diagnose can also create another one of these shocks leading to “more cancer” and more treatment. 

Had the women been left alone, and had she resolved the conflict I.e the child recovered, the body would naturally remove the excess tissue via internal fungi and bacteria, and no one would have known any better. 

There is a science that can literally qualify any symptom and pinpoint it directly to a pre programmed response due to a conflict based on the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm) which are the basis of all tissue in the body. 

It’s called German new medicine and it allows you to live life without fear.",conspiracy

Marsalek had previously made significant sums of money in the form of bitcoins from Dubai to Russia.

Wirecard had admitted in June that the annual balance sheet is missing 1.9 billion euros and that the money probably does not even exist. The stock exchange price of the Dax group crashed , the company filed for bankruptcy. In the case, the public prosecutor's office in Munich I.

The investigative platform Bellingcat previously reported that Marsalek had flown from Klagenfurt via the Estonian capital Tallin to Minsk in Belarus on the day he was released.

Because of the political conflict between the Russian leadership and Belarusian head of state Alexander Lukashenko, it was too risky for the GRU to leave Marsalek in the neighboring country. That is why he was taken to Russia.

This is where it gets interesting:

He bought airplane tickets and had someone in the Philippines falsify immigration records to mislead investigators he was in Asia. In various post-disappearance chats with friends and former colleagues, he alluded that he is in an East Asian time-zone, or that he is sipping cocktails on a sunny island. However, it was one answer to an unexpected question that led us to his actual destination – and his likely whereabouts today. In a chat with a former colleague, reported by Handelsblatt, he was asked, sympathetically, if he was in a “politically stable environment”. Marsalek laughed this question off, saying “do not worry, the same people have been in power for the last 25 years”.

Very few jurisdictions around the world can boast this degree of stability. (Russia is not one of them, as Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, i.e. 5 years short of his description). And while many rushed to seek his traces in African, Latin America or Asian regimes with longevity, we remembered of a bastion of stability that is much closer to Jan Marsalek’s home. In Belarus – only an hour’s flight from Germany – the same president, Aleksander Lukashenka, has been in power for the last 25 years (in fact, turning 26 years in 2 days).

Given that immigration data for Jan Marsalek from Philippines had been fabricated, it would be a legitimate question if there a risk that the border-crossing data from Belarus and Russia might also be tampered with, to create a further false lead. While this is technically possible, FSB has complete control over the Russian border service, and thus over the centralized Russia-Belarus border database. Therefore, any manipulation of data would have to be done at the behest of, or at least with the consent of, the FSB. If this were to happen, this would indicate a direct collaboration between Jan Marsalek and the FSB – which would, ironically, arguably be an even more newsworthy story than locating Marsalek in Belarus.

One of the world's most wanted men is hiding under Belarusian dictator Lukashenko.

When Lukashenko assumed office, he had the following cabinet in 2000:

Chairman of the Council of Ministers
Vladimir Putin
Mikhail Kasyanov
Mikhail Fradkov
Viktor Zubkov
Dmitry Medvedev
Mikhail Mishustin

All known as corrupt Russian mobsters with ties to political and intelligence agencies. Worth billions. Jan Marsalek is without a doubt controlled by GRU, and has a vested interest in being shielded in Belarus, which one can assume Putin allows.

Marsalek pulled a billion dollar heist and gets to coast in a private manor filled with all the hookers money can buy. Putin keeps Lukashenko in power for various political reasons and lines his pockets with a few hundred million.",conspiracy

Latest update on liquid insertions to ~~cause havoc &amp; make money~~ ""cure all ills"", comes in the form of yet another ""Emergency Use Authorization"" for an ""unapproved product"" [pp 1]

It's (always) striking when:

&gt; *""In clinical studies,* ***severe allergic reactions,*** *including
anaphylaxis, have been reported following the administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine""*

[pp 3]

is followed up by sidenotes such as:

&gt; *... cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to recipients.*

&gt; *""Serious adverse events are defined as:*

&gt; *• Death;*

&gt; *• A life-threatening adverse event;*

&gt; *• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;*

&gt; *• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions;*

&gt; *• A congenital anomaly/birth defect;*

&gt; *• An important medical event that based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the individual and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.*

Question:

First SAR is ""Death"".

Severe: Yes. But listing it as such; did it occur?

Or just Standard Precaution just in case?

I smell carpet rolling over a mishap not to be investigated.

But no deaths due to the actual injection is listed in the document. Worth lending an eye to.

Moving along:

***

[pp 5]

Two points to their ""credit"" - pt 2 on [pp 4]:

1)

&gt; *2. The vaccination provider must communicate to the individual receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine or their caregiver, information consistent with the “[Fact Sheet for Recipients](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download?utm%E2%80%94medium=email&amp;utm%E2%80%94source=govdelivery)""*

2) (From the Recipients-paper)

The injection does not contain aluminium-, nor mercury salts - nor mRNA tweaks.

This is a first. But see the very last paragraph on this post before nodding.

***

Which is why there are two fact-sheets; they will *not* give a recipient all the info in here contained.

Which means: injectors will say what they want - have you injected, and move you down the (dis)assembly-belt to prod the next guy.

***-NEXT!***

***

For order's sake:

&gt; *""To the extent feasible, report adverse events to Janssen Biotech, Inc.*

&gt; *e-mail* | *Fax number* | *Telephone numbers* |
---|---|---|
*JNJvaccineAE@its.jnj.com* | *215-293-995* | *US Toll Free: 1-800-565-4008 US Toll: (908) 455-9922""* |

[pp 5]

***

[pp 6]

&gt; *""There is no approved alternative vaccine to prevent COVID-19""*

***

&gt; *""Although limited scientific information is available, based on the totality of the scientific evidence available to date, it is reasonable to believe that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine* ***may*** *be effective for the prevention of COVID-19 ...""*

***

The injection may be so safe, it needs yet another paragraph:

&gt; *""THE COUNTERMEASURES INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM*

&gt; *The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a federal program that has been created to help pay for related costs of medical care and other specific expenses to compensate people injured after use of certain medical ountermeasures.""*

[pp 6]

***

[pp 8]

&gt; *""• The Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine does not contain a preservative.""*

A plus, I guess.

***

But fret not:

[pp 9]

&gt; *""It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults, and hospitalized or fatal cases of COVID-19 following vaccination with the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.""*

Notice how they wrap the insides out by twisting *""fatal cases of COVID-19 following vaccination""*?

Me neither. How. Fucking. Cute.

***

&gt; *""A total of 43,783 individuals were enrolled in this study, of whom 21,895 adults aged 18 years and older received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine""*

(People of several countries and rainbow-persuations, ages 18-100 : mean; 52 yo.

21,895 test subjects - 21,888 placebo)

[pp 10 &amp; 12]

***

[pp 12] continued

&gt; ***""Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and other events of interest***
""SAEs, excluding those related to confirmed COVID-19, were reported by 0.4% (n=83) of individuals who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine (N= 21,895) and 0.4% (n=96) of individuals who received placebo (N= 21,888)*""

I.e; More serious advents in the placebo-group than in the ""Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine"".

What ever else beside saline-water was in the placebo, I ask.

***

[pp 12] continued

&gt; *""Additional adverse events of interest, including but not limited to allergic, neurologic, inflammatory, vascular, and autoimmune disorders, were analyzed among all adverse events ...""*

[pp 13]

&gt; *""An SAE of* ***severe pain*** *in the injected arm, not responsive to analgesics, with immediate onset at time of vaccination, and that was ongoing 74 days following vaccination was reported in an individual who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. An SAE of* ***severe generalized weakness, fever, and headache,*** *with onset on the day following vaccination and resolution three days following vaccination was reported in an individual who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.""*

&gt; *""Both SAEs are likely related to the vaccine.""*

followed by:

* 11 people developed blood-clots

* 4 got seizures

* 6 developed tinnitus

As usual:

&gt; * *""For these events, a causal relationship with the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine cannot be determined.""*

In other words, if poor little you have pain afterwards, it's likely the ""vaccine"".

But if you dare develop life-threatening symptoms, such as blood-clots, it's your fault *""confounded by the presence of underlying medical conditions""*.

***

Pregnancy [pp 16]

&gt; *""Available data on Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.""*

They tested human 0.5ml doses on rabbits prior to-, and after mating:

&gt; * ""*No vaccine related adverse effects on female fertility, embryo-fetal or
postnatal development up to Postnatal Day 28 were observed.""*

Rabbits have short pregnancies compared to women, and woman may develop other issues down the line, not yet registered.

Don't fuck with an unborn child. There's no data regarding breast-feeding or lactation either.

***

[pp 20]

182 people got COVID after ""vaccination""...

14 severe/critical.

Mostly between 18-59 yo.

All survived.

5 placebo-recipients reported dead from COVID.

***

And so we're clear:

This is another cocktail: The familiar spike-proteins suspected to be the shell of the original virus, have been added to Adenovius 26.

Aka: [The common Cold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoviridae).

[pp 17]

You see, they have so much actual COVID virus on ice, they had to make a Flu with the usual Spike-Protein to make a vaccine with it.

So... Despite no heavy-metals nor mRNA;

* they effectively just made COVID-21.

And inject it into people, calling it a vaccine.

For a virus. That never mutates.

Ever.

I smell another strain being let lose quite soon.

(And thus: another vaccine in 2022.

And 2023...

And ... just jump off a cliff already)

464,We can’t keep doing this. There’s a simple solution to fixing American society.,"I think we can all pretty much all agree that there are some serious problems with American society, and that we have been on a steady trajectory of ignoring them and/or making them worse. The fact that we have been moving in the wrong direction for so long comes with a certain momentum that limits the range of possible futures we might encounter. At this point, the bullseye of what we can expect is pointing somewhere in the cyberpunk or post-apocalyptic genre. With utopian futurism somewhere off the edge of the dartboard, if it’s still even within the range of possibilities.

So, I would strongly suggest that what is needed now is radical change. However, I would prefer it not be violent revolution, because aside from that being horrific, it would likely make the situation worse before it gets better, and likely just delay solutions to what needs solving.

When I stay up at night wondering what will be the ultimate fate of this society, there is only one outcome that gives me hope. A populous uprising, through democratic means, that forces our government to change into one that benefits the common people over the interest of the elites.

The thing we are fighting, the source of all of these problems, is corruption, primarily that which has captured the two major governing parties. How well we solve this problem today will dictate how well all of the other problems rampant in our society are allowed to be fixed tomorrow.

I am working locally to institute new legislation to reform our elections, which will allow for new parties to replace the current establishment, or at least threaten them into action. However, the two-parties are largely united against this reform since it undermines their base of support. So, I have dreamt up an idea for a movement to force that change to occur faster.

It’s called Split Your Vote. It’s a bipartisan movement for people who are dissatisfied by their representation under the two-party system and want to support the growth of alternative options. Right now, support for both parties is at an all-time low, yet people are forced to support them because they see the other party as a worse alternative, so are trapped into voting for the lessor of two evils.

I’m encouraging people to pair up with trusted friends or family who are going to be voting opposite them and see if they can come to an agreement to both support third-party candidates instead. Since their votes would have cancelled out anyway, this is a way of supporting alternatives without the worry of throwing off the ratio of the two-party race. I’m hoping to generate some momentum for a mass migration of people withdrawing their support from the two-party establishment.

You can read more at [www.splityourvote.com](http://www.splityourvote.com/). If you want to help you can read through the site about how to take the pledge to join. I also just set up a subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitYourVote/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SplitYourVote/) if you want to assist promoting the movement.

TLDR: Society is broken because of corruption in the two major political parties, so let’s try and replace them both by triggering a mass migration away from the current establishment. The methodology of which will be people pairing up across the aisle and voting third-party, since then their votes would have cancelled out anyway, they don’t have to worry about throwing off the results of the two-party race.",conspiracy

I'll give some reasons. First is ego, t.v shows glorifying these people makes us want to emulate their behaviour, not benevolent by any means and is just virtue signaling.
Secondly, these people need to be clean. So why wear scrubs on the bus on the way to work? Why wear dirty scrubs on the way home in public.

520,WWII death tolls are completely exagerrated,"No idea why, but do the math yourself. The death tolls don't add up. Take the biggest battle ever, Stalingrad. We're told over 1 million russian troops were killed. Believable. In an area of about 10 square miles. Ok, a lot less believable. Then factor in that the majority of those million troops were being shuttled across the volga on tiny, slow boats. While russia was experiencing a shortage of fuel. Not believable at all. Well, maybe the germans killed the 1 million on their way across the volga? Could happen, if they had air superiority and could actually man their artillery (they couldn't, commanders at the time cited that as a huge reason for not being able to take the city; not to mention they were literally starving to death and couldn't supply their army with food, much less ammo to kill 1 million enemy). But that's just one example.
Look at iwo jima. We're told 20k japanese died there. Have you ever been there? 20k people wouldn't even fit there, let alone the 75k americans they were fighting. 
Official kia counts for individual battles don't even match up to the total for the war.

The only other explanation that physicians have given me is ""stress"". And trust me, I have been stressing. 

Anyway, I know this itself isn't a conspiracy. My point is that conspiracies are fucking with me not only mentally, but physically. I don't think I could ever fully ignore them though, I've been redpilled for about a year now and there's really no going back. I guess this means I should really just unplug for a bit.

524,The Cull,"#Submission Statement

When you know you are being lied to and you want to get to the truth, first you must dismantle the narrative. Look for what they talk about constantly. That is the smokecreen. That is the distraction to focus your attention in the wrong direction.

Next look for things they rarely mention. That is where you start digging. So, let's apply that to covid. You want the truth? Buckle up.

So, we know right from the start the health agencies were all ready to gush information about lung inflammation and the infection via ACE-2 receptors. If that was the prepared distraction, what were they using it to distract from? They were hiding a second method of infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has an alternate binding site that targets neuropilin 1 and neuropilin 2 receptors. You know what also does that? Rabies.

Neuropilin are the gateway to the central nervous system and the brain. Pathogens can use them to breach the blood brain barrier that prevents most diseases from infecting neural tissue. When you see Covid patients talking about the loss of their sense of smell for an extended length of time? That is called Anosmia. It means the virus has infected their brain and is damaging their temporal lobe. 

If all of this is not bad enough, there is more. The SARS-CoV-2 virus also has prion domains in it's spike protien. Prions are self replicating, infectious, malformed protiens that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is a neurodegenerative, 100% fatal brain disorder and we can see that virus is carrying those prions directly into neural tissue.

At least one neuro-scientist has stuck his neck out to talk about this. Kevin McCairn Ph.D. talks about it in this video. You ought to watch it and then you won't be wondering why people with inside information are double masking.

&gt;Summary: Black workers from the South migrate North during WWI to look for jobs left vacant by people going off to war. They were often relegated to the most undesirable jobs and faced some prejudice. Some of them join the local labor unions and find themselves being paid substantially more than they would have if they had stayed in the South. After the war ends, the labor union loses influence as there are men who want their jobs back that these workers filled. We see employers using race to try to break up the union and there are accurate depictions of the Chicago race riots that occurred in 1919. There were massive strikewaves after WWI when many workers were laid off or had their wages cut. This film is useful to anyone interested in the labor movement.",conspiracy
539,Flu Disappeared But No Talk About New Testing,"I don’t think many in this sub are buying that the masks and distancing have made the flu disappear, to which I agree, but I wanted to bring another possible reason for this ‘disappearance’ to anyone unaware that the previous standard testing methods for the flu viruses has been changed. It’s a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the few MSM mentions I have found says “many labs are using a CDC-developed ""multiplex test"" that checks specimens for both the coronavirus and flu”. [https://www.foxnews.com/health/amid-covid-19-pandemic-flu-has-disappeared-in-the-us](https://www.foxnews.com/health/amid-covid-19-pandemic-flu-has-disappeared-in-the-us) (Article also mentions some doctors are not even testing for flu because they don’t **think** it’s present!)

&amp;#x200B;

And from the CDC: CDC’s Influenza SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Assay and Required Supplies: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/multiplex.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/multiplex.html)

&amp;#x200B;

These tests were granted Emergency Use Authorization. (The FDA Letter of Authorization is downloadable here: [https://www.fda.gov/media/139744/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/139744/download)). Of note, like other EUA products, is “This test has not been FDA cleared or approved”.

&amp;#x200B;

And from Twist BioScience, one of at least several companies making the tests, referring to increased use of the tests: “Supplied the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with a customized version of Twist SARS-CoV-2 Synthetic RNA Controls for use in the CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay, an assay that tests for influenza A, B and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously. In addition to using the assay at its primary site, CDC intends to distribute this multiplex assay to additional public health laboratories for testing across the United States.” [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005935/en/Twist-Bioscience-Reports-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Financial-Results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005935/en/Twist-Bioscience-Reports-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Financial-Results)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - New tests being used, not FDA approved or cleared, that find rona but no flu. Most MSM and officials are pointing to masks, lockdowns, distancing and hand washing as reason flu has disappeared but none point out testing has been changed. Coincidence?",conspiracy

Journalist Files Charges against WHO and UN for Bioterrorism and Intent to Commit Mass Murder
Natural News.com ^ | June 25, 2009 | Barbara Minton, Natrual Health Editor

Posted on 25/06/2009, 14:08:37 by NorwegianViking

(NaturalNews) As the anticipated July release date for Baxter's A/H1N1 flu pandemic vaccine approaches, an Austrian investigative journalist is warning the world that the greatest crime in the history of humanity is underway. Jane Burgermeister has recently filed criminal charges with the FBI against the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations (UN), and several of the highest ranking government and corporate officials concerning bioterrorism and attempts to commit mass murder. She has also prepared an injunction against forced vaccination which is being filed in America. These actions follow her charges filed in April against Baxter AG and Avir Green Hills Biotechnology of Austria for producing contaminated bird flu vaccine, alleging this was a deliberate act to cause and profit from a pandemic.

Summary of claims and allegations filed with FBI in Austria on June 10, 2009

In her charges, Burgermeister presents evidence of acts of bioterrorism that is in violation of U.S. law by a group operating within the U.S. under the direction of international bankers who control the Federal Reserve, as well as WHO, UN and NATO. This bioterrorism is for the purpose of carrying out a mass genocide against the U.S. population by use of a genetically engineered flu pandemic virus with the intent of causing death. This group has annexed high government offices in the U.S.

Specifically, evidence is presented that the defendants, Barack Obama, President of the U.S, David Nabarro, UN System Coordinator for Influenza, Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO, Kathleen Sibelius, Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services, Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Department of Homeland Security, David de Rotschild, banker, David Rockefeller, banker, George Soros, banker, Werner Faymann, Chancellor of Austria, and Alois Stoger, Austrian Health Minister, among others, are part of this international corporate criminal syndicate which has developed, produced, stockpiled and employed biological weapons to eliminate the population of the U.S. and other countries for financial and political gain.

The charges contend that these defendants conspired with each other and others to devise, fund and participate in the final phase of the implementation of a covert international bioweapons program involving the pharmaceutical companies Baxter and Novartis. They did this by bioengineering and then releasing lethal biological agents, specifically the ""bird flu"" virus and the ""swine flu virus"" in order to have a pretext to implement a forced mass vaccination program which would be the means of administering a toxic biological agent to cause death and injury to the people of the U.S. This action is in direct violation of the Biological Weapons Anti-terrorism Act.

Burgermeister's charges include evidence that Baxter AG, Austrian subsidiary of Baxter International, deliberately sent out 72 kilos of live bird flu virus, supplied by the WHO in the winter of 2009 to 16 laboratories in four counties. She claims this evidence offers clear proof that the pharmaceutical companies and international government agencies themselves are actively engaged in producing, developing, manufacturing and distributing biological agents classified as the most deadly bioweapons on earth in order to trigger a pandemic and cause mass death.

In her April charges, she noted that Baxter's lab in Austria, one of the supposedly most secure biosecurity labs in the world, did not adhere to the most basic and essential steps to keep 72 kilos of a pathogen classified as a bioweapon secure and separate from all other substances under stringent biosecurity level regulations, but it allowed it to be mixed with the ordinary human flu virus and sent from its facilities in Orth in the Donau.

In February, when a staff member at BioTest in the Czech Republic tested the material meant for candidate vaccines on ferrets, the ferrets died. This incident was not followed up by any investigation from the WHO, EU, or Austrian health authorities. There was no investigation of the content of the virus material, and there is no data on the genetic sequence of the virus released.

In answer to parliamentary questions on May 20th, the Austrian Health Minister, Alois Stoger, revealed that the incident had been handled not as a biosecurity lapse, as it should have been, but as an offence against the veterinary code. A veterinary doctor was sent to the lab for a brief inspection.

Burgermeister's dossier reveals that the release of the virus was to be an essential step for triggering a pandemic that would allow the WHO to declare a Level 6 Pandemic. She lists the laws and decrees that would allow the UN and WHO to take over the United States in the event of pandemic. In addition, legislation requiring compliance with mandatory vaccinations would be put into force in the U.S. under conditions of pandemic declaration.

She charges that the entire ""swine flu"" pandemic business is premised on a massive lie that there is no natural virus out there that poses a threat to the population. She presents evidence leading to the belief that the bird flu and swine flu viruses have, in fact, been bioengineered in laboratories using funding supplied by the WHO and other government agencies, among others. This ""swine flu"" is a hybrid of part swine flu, part human flu and part bird flu, something that can only come from laboratories according to many experts.

WHO's claim that this ""swine flu"" is spreading and a pandemic must be declared ignores the fundamental causes. The viruses that were released were created and released with the help of WHO, and WHO is overwhelmingly responsible for the pandemic in the first place. In addition, the symptoms of the supposed ""swine flu"" are indistinguishable from regular flu or from the common cold. The ""swine flu"" does not cause death anymore often than the regular flu causes death.

Burgermeister notes that the figures for deaths reported for the ""swine flu"" are inconsistent and there is no clarity as to how the number of ""deaths"" has been documented.

There is no pandemic potential unless mass vaccinations are carried out to weaponize the flu under the guise of protecting the population. There are reasonable grounds for believing that the mandatory vaccines will be purposely contaminated with diseases that are specifically designed to cause death.

Reference is made to a licensed Novartis bird flu vaccine that killed 21 homeless people in Poland in the summer of 2008 and had as its ""primary outcome measure"" an ""adverse events rate"", thereby meeting the U.S. government's own definition of a bioweapon (a biological agent designed to cause an adverse events rate, i.e death or injury) with a delivery system (injection).

She alleges that the same complex of international pharmaceutical companies and international government agencies that have developed and released pandemic material have positioned themselves to profit from triggering the pandemic with contracts to supply vaccines. Media controlled by the group that is engineering the ""swine flu"" agenda is spreading misinformation to lull the people of the U.S. into taking the dangerous vaccine.

The people of the U.S. will suffer substantial and irreparable harm and injury if they are forced to take this unproven vaccine without their consent in accordance with the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, National Emergency Act, National Security Presidential Directive/NSPD 51, Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-20, and the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza.

In the U.S. since 2008, Burgermeister charges that those named in her allegations have implemented new and/or accelerated the implementation of laws and regulations designed to strip the citizens of the U.S. of their lawful constitutional rights to refuse an injection. These people have created or allowed provisions to remain in place that make it a criminal act to refuse to take an injection against pandemic viruses. They have imposed other excessive and cruel penalties such as imprisonment and/or quarantine in FEMA camps while barring the citizens of the U.S. from claiming compensation from injury or death from the forced injections. This is in violation of the laws governing federal corruption and the abuse of office as well as of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Through these actions, the named defendants have laid the groundwork for mass genocide.

Using the ""swine flu"" as a pretext, the defendants have preplanned the mass murder of the U.S. population by means of forced vaccination. They have installed an extensive network of FEMA concentration camps and identified mass grave sites, and they have been involved in devising and implementing a scheme to hand power over the U.S. to an international crime syndicate that uses the UN and WHO as a front for illegal racketeering influenced organized crime activities, in violation of the laws that govern treason.

She further charges that the complex of pharmaceutical companies consisting of Baxter, Novartis and Sanofi Aventis are part of a foreign-based dual purpose bioweapons program, financed by this international criminal syndicate and designed to implement mass murder to reduce the world's population by more than 5 billion people in the next ten years. Their plan is to spread terror to justify forcing people to give up their rights, and to force mass quarantine in FEMA camps. The houses, companies and farms and lands of those who are killed will be up for grabs by this syndicate.

By eliminating the population of North America, the international elite gain access to the region's natural resources such as water and undeveloped oil lands. And by eliminating the U.S. and its democratic constitution by subsuming it under a North American Union, the international crime group will have total control over North America.

Highlights from the complete dossier

The complete dossier of the June 10th action is a 69 page document presenting evidence to substantiate all charges. This includes:

Factual background that delineates time lines and facts that establish probable cause, UN and WHO definitions and roles, and history and incidents from the April, 2009 ""swine flu"" outbreak.

Evidence the ""swine flu"" vaccines are defined as bioweapons as delineates in government agencies and regulations classifying and restricting vaccines, and the fear of foreign countries that ""swine flu"" vaccines will be used for biological warfare.

Scientific evidence the ""swine flu"" virus is an artificial (genetic) virus.

Scientific evidence the ""swine flu"" was bioengineered to resemble the Spanish flu virus of 1918 including quotes from Swine Flu 2009 is Weaponized 1918 Spanish Flu by A. True Ott, Ph.D., N.D., and a Science Magazine report from Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger et.al.

The genome sequence of the ""swine flu""

Evidence of the deliberate release of the ""swine flu"" in Mexico

Evidence as to the involvement of President Obama that delineates his trip to Mexico which coincided with the recent ""swine flu"" outbreak and the death of several officials involved in his trip. Contention is made that the President was never tested for ""swine flu"" because he had been previously vaccinated.

Evidence as to the role of Baxter and WHO in producing and releasing pandemic virus material in Austria includes a statement from a Baxter official stating the accidentally distributed H5N1 in the Czech Republic was received from a WHO reference center. This includes delineation of evidence and allegations from Burgermeister's charges filed in April in Austria that are currently under investigation.

Evidence Baxter is an element in a covert bioweapons network

Evidence Baxter has deliberately contaminated vaccine material.

Evidence Novartis is using vaccines as bioweapons

Evidence as to WHO's role in the bioweapons program

Evidence as to WHO's manipulation of disease data in order to justify declaring a Pandemic Level 6 in order to seize control of the USA.

Evidence as to the FDA's role in covering up the bioweapons program

Evidence as to Canada's National Microbiology Lab's role in the bioweapons program.

Evidence of the involvement of scientists working for the UK's NIBSC, and the CDC in engineering the ""swine flu"".

Evidence vaccinations caused the Spanish killer flu of 1918 including belief of Dr. Jerry Tennant that the widespread use of aspirin during the winter that followed the end of World War I could have been a key factor contributing to the earlier pandemic by suppressing the immune system and lowering body temperatures, allowing the flu virus to multiply. Tamiflu and Relenza also lower body temperatures, and therefore can also be expected to contribute to the spread of a pandemic.

Evidence as to manipulation of the legal framework to allow mass murder with impunity.

Constitutional issues: the legality vs. illegality of jeopardizing the life, health and public good by mass vaccinations.

The issue of immunity and compensation as evidence of intent to commit a crime.

Evidence as to the existence of an international corporate crime syndicate.

Evidence of the existence of the ""Illuminati"".

Evidence as to the depopulation agenda of the Illuminati/Bilderbergs and their involvement in the engineering and release of the artificial ""swine flu"" virus.

Evidence that weaponized flu was discussed at the annual Bilderberg meeting in Athens from May 14-17, 2009, as part of their agenda of genocide, including a list of attendees who, according to a statement once made by Pierre Trudeau, view themselves as genetically superior to the rest of humanity.

Media is keeping Americans clueless about the threat they are under

Jane Burgermeister is a dual Irish/Austrian who has written for Nature, the British Medical Journal, and American Prospect. She is the European Correspondent of the Renewable Energy World website. She has written extensively about climate change, biotechnology, and the ecology.

In addition to the charges currently under investigation that she filed against Baxter AG and Avir Green Hills Biotechnology in April, she has filed charges against WHO and Baxter among others concerning a case of exploding ""swine flu"" vials meant for a research lab on a busy IC train in Switzerland.

In her view, control of the media by the ruling elite has allowed the world crime syndicate to further its agenda unabated while the rest of the people remain in the dark about what is really going on. Her charges are an attempt to get around this media control and bring the truth to light.

Her greatest concern is that ""in spite of the fact Baxter has been caught red handed nearly triggering pandemic, they are also moving ahead, together with allied pharma companies, with supplying the vaccine for pandemics."" Baxter is hurrying to get this vaccine to market some time in July.",conspiracy

623,A question on the time keeping of ancient sites and cathedrals and passing of knowledge.,"TLDR/Question: Why is such knowledge kept hidden? Is it standard for most of the civilization to be unaware? If so, why? If not, why have the elite stopped the flow information? What changed? 

----

BACKGROUND:

Many ancient sites and cathedrals hold within their geographic location, physical dimension and construction, a reference or relationship to mathematical universal constants and cycles of our galaxy, planet and solar system. Most notably, the Precession (approx. 26,000 years) and a Zodiac (approx. 1/12 of a Precession). 

The most understood link of these times seems to correlate with the change of climate and the impact of human civilizations across the globe; similar to descriptions of cataclysms and disasters found in myths, stories, and many religions. 

Regardless of what the time keeping matched with, these sites were developed in different eras and peoples, yet they all count the same thing in a similar manner. The civilizations are separated by time and cultures but the knowledge still remained. This knowledge was either rediscovered every time (unlikely) or being passed down. I believe the latter is more likely because the methodology (geographic significance and Giza profile) to achieve the same time keeping remained constant despite contemporary differences and technological capabilities. From this point, you can infer there was some greater practice to carry on this knowledge for whatever reason.

Now here's where it connects back to conspiracy theory. Whatever the event(s) may have been, the successors/survivors must have at least included the people with such knowledge. It is often theorized the modern day elite are more aware than what has been discovered. If this is the case, it would follow the elite are part of the the lineage (not necessarily in the ancestral sense) of these timekeeping bearers. 

Question: Why is such knowledge kept hidden? Is it standard for most of the civilization to be unaware? If so, why? If not, why have the elite stopped the flow information? What changed?

Note: This question is applies to a wide range of topics.",conspiracy

I believe that the spokesperson, Nancy Lieder, a human representative and explainer to the rest of us, has been sharing Zeta information since the mid 1990s. It's one of the longest running conspiracy theory, warning type rabbit holes that I have explored. At first I was intrigued. The overlap to Alien reveals, the Nibiru planet legend, Pole Shift science, and other bits and pieces made it fun to devour. I followed their website, (zetatalk . com) and continue to read updates to this day. Over time, I noticed how the platform included more and more political pieces. I also noticed how the predictions, the dire warnings of the end of the world, or at least the drastic changes associated with the Events, shared dates that continually pushed forward into the future. Goal posts moving seems to be an ongoing theme, not just with this prediction oriented group but with many of the prophet type conspiracies. I never knew back when I was a young conspiracy aficionado , learning about Y2K, Zetas and Nibiru, and the December 21, 2020 end of the world, and others, that the information would end up being so fluid, and the deadlines so easily moved.

I really like the idea that the soul gets to choose Service to Self or Service to Others. That's something I learned during this adventure. It doesn't matter if the soul originated in our timeline or another, our dimension or another, or if you believe there are thousands on thousands of 'others' out there with souls, the rules are basic. Serving self, or serving others. 

Just because I question the date setters doesn't necessarily mean I'm questioning the data presented. I can have a faith that's solid even when the humans who present their point of view end up being sketchy with details. But at what point do the details' accuracy end up cancelling the whole deal?

Y2K never came to fruition. December 21, the stars didn't align in such a way that tumbled some of the stars into our oceans. So those are clear examples of answers. With the Zeta predictions, the information has appeal. Some of the legends overlap other rabbit hole explorings I've done. But ultimately...?

Have you ever researched Nibiru? Considered the science behind Pole Shifts, the giant calderas erupting in Yellowstone, the Biblical predictions and dates associated like the December 21, 2020 thing? Then had those ideas twisted or simply not proven true, and had you question your overall investment in the conspiracy travels your mind enjoys?",conspiracy

659,"500,000 COVID deaths, but over 300,000 could have been prevented","  

**The Story of how FAUCI and Public Health Blocked Early Home COVID Treatment and Killed Over 300,000**

Joel S. Hirschhorn

Americans have every right to be in a fit over the news that 500,000 Americans have died from the COVID-19 infection. Hard to imagine worse news. What is missing from this news is that way over 300,000 of these deaths could have been prevented through the widespread use of cheap, safe and proven early home treatments that in the US and worldwide have been used successfully. Details on these treatments and the generic medicines, including hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, and supplements, including zinc, quercetin and vitamin D, used by courageous doctors are in the new book **PANDEMIC BLUNDER – FAUCI AND PUBLIC HEALTH BLOCKED EARLY HOME COVID TREATMENT.**

One of the pioneers that created a widely used protocol nearly a year ago, Dr. Zelenko, wrote the Foreword for the book.

The book is discussed in a new [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/user-694711047/the-media-and-fauci-blocked-successful-covid-19-treatments-guest-joel-hirschhorn) that tells the story of why the book was written, mainly to save lives. And it is now available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pandemic-Blunder-Public-Blocked-Treatment/dp/197723822X/ref=nav_ya_signin?dchild=1&amp;keywords=Pandemic+Blunder&amp;qid=1612289098&amp;sr=8-1&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;captcha_verified=1&amp;) as a cheap Kindle edition and a paperback,

Pandemic blunder is defined as the failure of the United States public health system and federal agencies to support and promote early home/outpatient treatment for the COVID-19 pandemic disease. Considerable medical information and data convincingly show that when given early a number of proven safe, cheap generic medicines and protocols knock out the coronavirus. Early means within the first few days of getting symptoms or a positive test. Risking condemnation, a relatively few pioneering and courageous doctors have been using innovative approaches to prevent their covid patients from needing hospital care and facing death. Many expert views of doctors support the view that 70 percent to 80 percent of covid deaths could have been prevented – and still can for future victims of the disease. But the vast majority of US doctors are following the dictates of NIH and FDA that behind the scene are driven by Dr. Anthony Fauci, who does not deserve the endless praise by the mainstream press. Major medical societies also follow the misguided actions by the federal agencies.

This book does more than describe the pandemic blunder, particularly in terms of the influence of Dr. Anthony Fauci. It can help Americans protect their lives by not being victimized by disinformation and propaganda from leftist media. Pandemic management has failed because of corrupt forces aiming to make billions of dollars from expensive medicines and vaccines. There has been widespread dereliction of duty on the part of many local, state and federal government officials that continue to refuse all the data supporting early home treatment and prevention. Contrary to the entire history of medicine early treatment of any illness or disease has been subverted to promote expensive hospital treatment that has resulted in the 500,000 COVID deaths. This is medical malpractice at a historic high level. All those refusing to support early home treatment are guilty of criminally negligent homicide, a claim that many have made against New York governor Andrew Cuomo.

The way to change the government restrictions on early home treatments for COVID is for the public to fully understand what has been denied them and to demand the medical freedom of all doctors to use what is best for their patients.",conspiracy
660,Covid and the new concept of social bubbles,"Today I learned about something new they are implementing. It's called : social bubbles. 

[It's explicitly described on the Indiana gov. website](https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/files/20_COVID-19-social%20bubbles%2011.16.20.pdf)

Political leaders in France and Belgium talked about it, and are trying to implement it, tO sToP tHe PaNdEmIc.

How can qualified actual MD recommend social bubbles/pods is beyond me. It makes me lose the faith I have in mainstream medicine, that is already all gone anyway.

[Remember this interesting interview of Vaclav Klaus, former PM of the Czech republic ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmYFQRGPNnY). He says at 4:00 in the interview that the first thing they noticed during the communist era is they were trying to isolate people, ""erase as much as possible horizontal relations"". He says it's all about fear and control.

Covid is the pretext to implement communism, at a global scale this time, so we have nowhere to escape.

When you comply, and if you take the vaccine, you're stuck, you will have no choice but to get along with these rules. Especially when they combine it with CBDC. You won't even be allowed to see your own child or your grandma, because that would mean too many people in your social bubble LOL. Before you know it, what makes you human (personal interrelationships) is no more. Before you know it, you're on xanax. And once they control you this way because you're so weak emotionally, you will accept anything they require that will restrict you rights even more, and you will thank your persecutor for it, because they will allow you to exceptionally add 1 or 2 more individuals in your social bubble in return.

#  Anti-Bolshevik Vade-Mecum	 

&gt;*Office of the International Entente Against the Third International*   
Geneva, March 1926   


[The Red Terror](https://cdm21047.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/russian/id/6384)

&gt;The terrorist doctrine of the leaders of the Bolshevist International: 

* Ninety per cent of Russians may perish so long as ten per cent. remain at the time of the world revolution. (Lenin.) 
* You object to the gentle terror which we practice against our class enemies, but know this, that in a month at latest this terror will take on a crueller form. (Trotsky.) 
* Pitiless repression is necessary, banishing all sentimentality. (Lounatcharsky \[ Lunacharsky \]) 
* We represent organised terror... we know no quarter. (Dzerginsky. \[ Dzerzhinsky \]) 
* We shall carry on organised terror. If you notice a bourgeois escaping the eye, vigilant, as it is, of our organisation, catch him and kill him with your own hands. If you see a revolutionary socialist of the right, a menchevik \[ menshevik \], or any kind of traitor, succeed in hiding himself kill him too.(Lassovsky.) 
* We were terrorists at the beginning of the revolution and even before, and we always shall be. We need leaders who feel nothing but mortal hatred towards the bourgeoisie; who organise and prepare the proletariat for an implacable struggle; who do not hesitate to use the most violent means towards those who stand in their way. It is the bitterest civil war that history has ever known. (Zinovieff. \[ Zinoviev \]) 
* The Cheka does not judge its enemies; it strikes them down without pity and suppresses any who are not on the same side of the fence. (Latzis.) 
* With the Red Army, the detachments of the extraordinary commission constitute the glory and beauty of the communist party. (Zinovieff.)   


&gt;The Cheka, which is now known as the G.P.U., is the instrument through which the bolshevist leaders carry out their terrorist doctrines. It is at one and the same time a surety police, a political police, an organ of counter-espionage, and an extraordinary tribunal, without public ministry or defence, or judges worthy of the name. It possesses special detachments in each centre, has a special service of executioners and administers the prisons.   
&gt;  
&gt;All the organisms of the Cheka are directed by members of the communist party. The special personnel is recruited among liberated convicts, robbers and assassins, among the agents of the ""Ochrana"", among degenerates and intellectual perverts.   
&gt;  
&gt;The personnel of the Cheka is composed of Jews, Russians, Letts, Poles, Armenians, Hungarians, the scum of every race.   
&gt;  
&gt;It is the élite of evildoers to whom the soviet government has given power of life and death. It is this Cheka, this G.P.U. which has been and is still the pillar of bolshevism. Bieloborodoff, Dzerjinsky's assistant, has declared: ""Terror is at the base of the soviet power.  
&gt;  
&gt;If we suppress the Cheka,"" said the congress of the Russian communist party, ""the power of the soviets cuts the branch on which it sits.   
&gt;  
&gt;This formidable organisation is divided into a number of sections, sub-sections and organs of various descriptions: general sections for action, information, finance, transport, etc. They are all under the orders of Unschlicht, who comes immediately under Dzerjinsky \[ Dzerzhinsky \]. The G.P.U. has numerous sections in nearly every foreign country charged with spying and terrorist activities. 

[Head of the CheKa, the monster, Dzerzhinsky](https://preview.redd.it/8b1ugyciq1k61.png?width=329&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=baca1dfcebec6c46e22cf9a24082ca5bc1012fd3)

&gt;The chief of the Cheka, Dzerjinsky, who in addition occupies one of the highest posts in the soviet administration, is the most odious of the whole band of bolshevik criminals. The streams of innocent blood which he has caused to flow, and the innumerable tortures he has inflicted on millions of victims will never be forgotten.   
&gt;  
&gt;Here, in a few words, are some brief sketches of some of Dzerjinsky's \[ Dzerzhinsky's \] underlings (Dzerzhinsky was a Polish Jew whose father changed the family name in a successful bid for Polish nobility).   
&gt;  
&gt;Sarokine is a rough and uncultivated person who plays the dandy. He treats prisoners as slaves and dirt, but he rarely shoots them himself.   
&gt;  
&gt;Advokine is fond of dress. All he wears is noticeably new and his hands flash with jewels. He is a cocaine addict.   
&gt;  
&gt;Tschernavski, cocaine maniac, had always to kill a certain number of victims or he was not happy.   
&gt;  
&gt;Rosa Schwarz at Kieff \[ Kiev \], who counted her victims by hundreds, took cocaine, and, cigarette in mouth, went to see the prisoners naked in their cells and killed them with a revolver shot or burned their eyes with her cigarette.   
&gt;  
&gt;Deutsch, who, at Odessa, organised the shame of women and assassination of men, was decorated with the order of the Red Flag.   
&gt;  
&gt;Terrihochoff, shot prisoners by moonlight in the gardens of the Cheka.   
&gt;  
&gt;Who were the chiefs of the Cheka at Odessa? Several Jews, some Chinese and a negro whose speciality was to pull the tendons of his victims while watching their faces and showing his white teeth in a broad smile.   
&gt;  
&gt;One could continue this enumeration indefinitely.   
&gt;  
&gt;The agents of the Cheka — subalterns, commandants, gaolers, executioners, feared by all, wearing Wellington boots and leather jerkins, and carrying revolvers at their waists — go wherever they please. They have free railway passes and free food and lodging. They lead a life of debauch and are bound to their immediate chiefs and the soviet government by the terrible fellowship of crime.",conspiracy

695,"The ""loose control"" theory","This is basically a theory that I've come up with after watching everything unfold the past 5-6 years.  Basically, the idea is that there are groups of elites who have agendas and different things they want to do for personal reasons or otherwise, but they don't necessarily have ""absolute"" power over everything.   They just have enough power to generally accomplish what they need to.   For example, a common theme is people saying how every single election is rigged and there is no way someone gets in if they weren't chosen.   However, if you actually look back at the past 20 or so years of elections pretty much always Soros got his guy in as the democrat nominee as well as the republican nominee.  There is no real difference whether John Mccain or Obama won the presidency when they're both working for the same person, so there was no need to rig anything beyond that point.  

The second thing I want to talk about is who gets ""suicided"".   Generally the people who actually end up going this route are unimportant people to the public who get close to exposing something actually serious.   Dissenters with unpopular opinions almost NEVER get suicided even if they might be annoying, they just get discredited.  This leads me to believe that there is generally not a group crushing all dissent with absolutely no mercy, but if you get too close to dangerous territory you're gone.  

I feel like if you actually take a look at everything and view it through this lens of being part of an agenda or plan but not part of a perfect plan, it makes a lot more sense.  For example, if you get 100 elites in a room and get them to talk about depopulation, I doubt you can get all of them to actually agree on it or the best method.   People are too independent and selfish and it only makes sense that some of them will dissent or do things for various reasons.",conspiracy

The problem is, nobody asked them to do that, just like how nobody asked for most ""woke"" changes that corporations are making. The real reason they're doing this is, as always, because of money. Millennials are more ""woke"" than their parents, and now they're the ones buying toys for their own kids, so companies like Hasbro are trying to win out that demographic with socially conscious toys.

In this regard, it's kind of an unintended conspiracy, because while Hasbro's objective is profit, the end result is social division. Personally, I don't really care which imaginary chromosomes the plastic potato has, but I wish people would see through the bullshit smokescreen and realize that these actions are corporations capitalizing on conflict, and not something the left is actively trying to do or care about.

There are plenty of examples of actual forced ""wokeness"", but examples like these take away from them, and fuel a cycle of division and conflict from which large corporations are extracting millions of dollars.

Here me out 

New Zealand after having a event full consists of a T20 match in a stadium ,the stadium went full . All people came out to watch and seats were full . (Re-open lockdown)

Now after the match everyone thought well what a match ,I should have gone  to the next match seeing the result win by 5 runs when both teams total scored 400 runs in 40 overs . (Those who don't know Cricket its basically in anlaogy wise 1 chance you can score upto 6 points  ,1 over has 6 chances )( lot of money for corporation)

But here comes the divide part the people(let's call them A) who didn't went might after seeing the whole packed stadium( let's call them B) may have started doubt of these lockdown ,covid , vaccination efficacy ,vaccine liability, vaccine side effects ,masks not required etc because common sense is when you saw it in front of your own 👀.(people in doubts)

But suddenly those people doubts of these things are removed by government putting a 7 day lockdown after the match and next match goes without audience. (Conquer A doubts ) now  back to believing that lockdown was right in first place and people like B are stupid breaking these lockdown etc (loss of jobs and economy and increase in brainwashing to believe )

we know that players(let's call them C) are unaffected because of the money related to TV companies related where people can't answer why not a single player died . I think they are immortal to covid . (Common sense which people ignore )

726,Rand Paul is very worried about mutilating children's genitals... so why doesn't he talk about circumcision?,"Circumcision is permanent genital mutilation.  It far more common than any transgender-related procedure, and it's performed on infants, not teenagers. If a teenager can't consent to transgender treatment, how can a baby consent to have his genitals permanently disfigured? 

It is even legal for religious officials with no medical training to perform circumcision and place their mouths on the bleeding genitals of an infant, despite the strong possibility of that could infect the infant with herpes or another disease.

If you're worried about children being raised as the wrong gender, consider David Reimer. David was the victim of a botched circumcision (much more common than you would think) and doctors recommended that he be raised as a girl. David experienced intense depression and gender dysphoria and transitioned back to male as a teenager. Eventually he took his own life.

Rand Paul is a coward. He wants to talk about transgender issues because that will get him praise from the right-wing press, but going after circumcision would have the exact same conservative outfits label him an anti-Semite and cause him to lose access to certain funding networks for his re-election campaigns. He pretends to be a principled doctor standing up for the rights of children, but he won't take a stand against mutilating the genitals of babies. He's just another politicians trying to get some good TV coverage for his inevitable presidential campaign.

Many of us start out as innocent little truth hunters but end the journey as deluded Bigfoot enthusiasts or part time magickal practitioner in lieu of actually having an interest in objective truth.

The mystics and shamans of the annulus of history show us that there is a path to be follow, we just happen to live in a time when discerning this truth from the nonsense is becoming harder and harder due to the advancement of what we like to call technology.

Opinion has trumped fact which in turn has left the common man trapped in a cage of his own making adorned with the colours of his chosen clan. Posters on the wall, bookshelves full of dusty tomes, clothing displaying team iconography all reinforce this comfortable yet oppressive womb like headspace the majority of consumers reside in.

Brush off identification and ask yourself what is the truth.

Due to this ongoing situation I have taken it upon myself to attempt to find a remedy.
This effort has culminated in what I have dubbed “The New Shamanic”.

In short, The New Shamanic is a body of work that will span many different types of media in the attempt to provide the consumer with an arsenal of philosophical and artistic tools to navigate the ever deepening myriad of mental issues human beings have to put up with on a daily basis.

If any of this sounds like something you’d be interested in taking a part of then please don’t hesitate to get in contact as I am looking for like minded individuals to add to the team in 2021 so a real effort can be made to relinquish the droves of uninspired workers of their apathy so that by 2025 the majority of “common joes” can harness their artistic capabilities.

795,"The exact process by which currency is created and manipulated is not generally well understood, but might be the most important aspect of maintaining cabal power. How currency is actually created. (Repost of /u/letsbebuns)","I propose that it would be superior to fix the currency system and replace it with something honest. Open-source rules that are clear and simple and available to all for viewing.

While some people have proposed eliminating currency altogether, I think that completely eliminating currency would result in:

1) a lot of problems in the transition period

2) a lot of human behavior problems in the post-scarcity period

3) How does one eliminate currency without slipping into communism, which doesn't work?

I propose that fixing the currency system is easier to implement than eliminating it entirely. Currency is nothing but tokens, representations of value. An honest currency system has not been tried in our lifetime! We have no frame of reference for what it would be like to earn a little bit of money and have it keep its value forever.

The major problems with currency are like this:

#DEBT BASED CURRENCY:

All ""money"" currently in circulation is debt. Federal Reserve Notes (FRN) are purchased by the government from a private bank called the federal reserve. The supreme court (united states vs gonzalez) decided that the federal reserve is a privately owned bank in 1983. So when the govt needs to enter more money into circulation, even though they have the legal authority to issue it (scrip) straight out of the treasury, or to mint it through the bureau of printing and engraving, instead they go to this private bank and take out a loan. The loan has interest attached to it. That money enters circulation, and the debt runs.

This is problematic for several reasons. First of all, it's unnecessary debt. The govt gave away their power to print money to someone else (they are authorized to print money but not to give the power away) and then they go into debt to receive something that they gave away in the first place.

Second of all, that means that whatever value enters circulation, then that means an equal amount of debt plus interest. (.6%)

What does this mean?

It means the US govt owes more money than is in circulation. They owe over 100% of the money in circulation. This is why it is said that the currency of the USA is ""DEBT BASED CURRENCY""

#FRACTIONAL RESERVE LENDING:

The above is bad enough. But now hear this: You give bank $100. They have $100 on the books now. Under fractional reserve lending, they are legally able to CREATE money out of nothing based on their holdings.

If a new person comes in and wants a loan, they are able to create new money (debt) at a 9:1 ratio. This is confusing, but it means from the original $100, they are able to lend out $90 of it, earning interest on that 90$, while at the same time telling the original investor that their entire 100$ is still in the bank.

If that guy who took the loan for 90$ goes and puts it in another bank, that bank can also make more loans at the same 9:1 ratio. Meaning they can loan out $81 dollars while still telling the guy they have the original $90 still on the books. If the guy who took out the loan for $81 dollars wants to put that in a new bank, the new bank can loan $73 while still telling him they have the original $81 on the books.

If you continue these loans until the amount is too low to loan, then from that original $100 dollar investment, the bankers can spawn almost $1,000 in new currency. The problem is, all of this new currency is in the form of a loan to a bank. It's $900 of new debt entering the economy on a $100 real money investment. They loaned out money they never had and are collecting interest on it!

And this is separate from the fact that ALL the currency is backed by debt, as shown in the first section. These two issues COMPOUND each other.

#FIAT CURRENCY

Fiat is latin for ""Let it be"" and ""Fiat Lux"" means ""Let there be light"". In the world of currency, Fiat currency is called such because it is designated currency by an authority, not because it has an intrinsic value. When items have an intrinsic value, they are not a FIAT currency. Fiat currencies are entered into circulation by an authority, not by nature.

Fiat currencies are not always bad, but they have the potential to become bad, because they are synthetic and made by man. Therefore the rules which govern them are obviously subject to the appetites of man. You can make any rule you want and add it to a fiat currency.

In the USA, the constitution requires the government to use gold and silver. However, the government of previous generations (before any of us were alive) didn't follow this and created a situation where the economy was inflated with fiat scrip. Due to the presence of so much scrip, the economy can probably never go back to the way it used to be. It has been artificially inflated way too high and the correction would be egregious.

Most modern thinkers agree that the best way to handle the fiat currency situation is not to enforce the old ways, but learn the lessons from them instead. Study the Tallystick system, perhaps the most famous currency system of the ancient world, wherein the King took boughs of wood and carved unique lines into them. Then, he split the bough in half and kept one side in his castle while entering the opposing side into circulation among the people. Pretty good so far, right?

The final step was to make the king's taxes payable in the tallystick. You could discharge your monetary duty to the king by simply giving him a stick (which had originated with him). This instantly made the sticks very valuable and people accepted them as currency overnight. No gold necessary - just a stick. The tallystick system flourished for over 700 years.

#SOLUTIONS

1) Obviously the biggest problem is that the federal reserve met on christmas eve 1913 without a quorum present in senate and passed their unlawful charter. Since then americans have not owned their money, but instead they borrow it from a private bank and they pay interest for the privilege of using currency. Seeing as how the Divine Creator as well as the United States Constitution allows for the government of the people to handle this themselves, there is really no reason to rely on a ""for profit"" bank to provide this service.

2) The second biggest problem is that the currency doesn't hold its value and is debt-based. This is by design. It's annoying, because, let's say you work 8 hours and you can buy 8 sandwiches as a result. However, you stick that money under your mattress for 6 months, and suddenly you can only buy 7 sandwiches with that money. If you wait years, you might only be able to buy 4 sandwiches instead of the original 8. That's pretty jacked up, because the number of hours you worked to earn that purchasing power didn't change. You worked the number of hours necessary to purchase 8 sandwiches! You don't get your time back when inflation strikes...

It's actually really easy to keep a currency at the same value. Silver has kept identical purchasing power for the last 100 years. You could buy the same amount of sandwiches with a silver quarter in 1925 as you can today. The only thing that changes is the value of silver in FRNs. The value of silver is not changing - the value of the FRN is. Crazy, right?

I don't recommend going to a global standard of metals for exchange, but the lessons that can be learned there are invaluable. They prove it's possible to keep purchasing power identical for 100+ years.

And the currency needs to go back into the hands of the people's government. Eliminate the private banks from government entirely.

3) Eliminate Usury from the issuance of currency entirely. THIS ALONE WOULD BE LIKE GIVING THE WORLD TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS

There is a lot more but this post is getting a bit long. Basically the problem is not money, but the fact that the money has been completely corrupted and used as a weapon.

As you can see here, the entire currency system is set up from top to bottom to steal from people.

Fixing the inherent theft is the superior path.

But I watched one of his most viewed live performances of this song and something seemed strange about it. 

He seems very hesitant to say ""My Way"". At one point even pauses, and shakes his head ""no"" just before saying ""My Way"". 

And if you listen to they lyrics. It's no so much that he did it ""His way"", rather he did ""what he had to do"". 

There is a deep rabbit hole around celebrities and ""Selling your soul"". Sinatra being one of the biggest recording artists of all time, if the theories are true, would have certainly been part of that. (Whatever that may be).

1:13 He says ""I did what I had to do""

1:42 He stops, looks to his left, and takes a longer pause than should be taken for the song before saying ""My way"". 

Knowing what we know now about how the music industry works, and how awful it is to the artists. Could this live performance have shown Frank having some difficulty singing the song while knowing he was never in charge of his actions or career?

874,My theory that the House Majority Leader's plane was bombed in 1972 and the CIA covered it up,"### Preface

**Note** – I cannot emphasize enough that **this is a highly speculative theory with very little supporting evidence.** That said, it's at least plausible so I'm posting here for my own reference in the future, for your feedback, and for others to build upon.

**Background** – If you aren't familiar with the story, a twin-engine Cessna 310 transporting two congressmen (one was the House Majority Leader) went missing somewhere between Anchorage and Juneau on October 16th, 1972.

**Bomb Theory** – The easy explanation is that it crashed due to weather, mechanical failure, pilot error, etc. That's still the leading theory but there is [some evidence](https://www.planeandpilotmag.com/news/pilot-talk/2020/09/23/did-a-bomb-bring-down-the-begich-boggs-flight/) to suggest that the plane was bombed by the mob in an attempt to gain control over Alaskan politics during the lucrative oil boom that was happening at the time. Even if the wreck had been found, it would look like an assassination of the House Majority Leader (who also served on the Warren Commission) while the actual target (the congressman from Alaska) would be presumed to be collateral damage.

**Sources** – Everything I know stemmed from the recent [Missing in Alaska podcast](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-missing-in-alaska-62503099/), which chronicles something like 7 years of the host investigating this story. I'm not part of the podcast, just a fan. If reading is more your thing, here is probably the most up-to-date and comprehensive article available: [1972 Cessna 310C Alaska Disappearance](https://www.planeandpilotmag.com/news/pilot-talk/2020/09/21/1972-cessna-310c-alaska-disappearance/)

-----

### Assumptions

My theory relies on the sole assumption that the plane should have been found. To quote the Missing in Alaska podcast, Tail End episode, 2:45 timestamp:

&gt; In 1972, Air Force Major Henry Stocker, the search commander, told reporters ""95% to 99% of what we are looking for, we locate."" ""Of the previous 1,200 planes to disappear,"" one official said ""only three had never been found."" ... An Air Force document I obtained says ... ""Their probability of detection of the aircraft, if intact in the search area, was in excess of 97%. The probability of locating aircraft wreckage or survivors without fires or signaling devices was in excess of 95% in all search areas and in excess of 99% in the highest probability area.""

You could call the accuracy of the above statements into question but I'm going to take them at face value for the purposes of this theory, which leaves me with the possibilities below.

-----

# Possibilities

1. It's just bad luck that the plane was never found.

2. The plane crashed outside of the search area.

3. The plane was searched for less effectively than previous missing planes.

4. The pilot did not want to be found.

5. The plane was found but kept secret.

Here are my thoughts on each of those possibilities:

1. **Bad luck** – It is certainly possible that the plane simply crashed going through Portage Pass, slid into a crevice, and was never seen again. Some variant of crashing in a hard-to-find way is generally accepted as the most likely explanation. There was bad weather that would have contributed to a crash and also hindered search efforts. That said, the pilot was highly experienced and there's reason to believe that the plane may have had several de-icing and anti-icing devices. Not to mention this was one of the largest search efforts ever at the time. All of this is covered in great detail in the podcast so I won't dwell on it. Suffice to say, it is an unlikely combination that this particular plane crashed in the first place AND was never found during the massive search or in the 48 years since.

2. **Outside search area** – The pilot would sometimes stray from proper flight paths but the search area was expansive and as far as I'm aware, there's no reason to believe the plane crashed outside of the enormous search area.

3. **The search was lacking** – The search was exhaustive but it may have been inferior to other missing plane searches due to weather or if the plane crashed in a way that searchers weren't expecting. If it exploded due to a bomb, for example, the wreckage might be hard to recognize. Also, the plane probably didn't have an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) but the quote above specifically mentions a 95% or better chance of finding the plane wreckage even without signaling devices or survivors. All things considered, I think the search was at least as comprehensive as other missing plane searches, if not significantly more comprehensive.

4. **Pilot didn't want to be found** – This would either mean the plane landed somewhere and all four occupants lived the rest of their lives in secrecy or that the pilot was suicidal and crashed in a hard-to-find place on purpose, possibly outside the search area. I'm mentioning it here for completeness but there is no evidence at all to support either of these possibilities.

5. **Plane was found but kept secret** – In my opinion, this is the only viable explanation aside from #1 above. Possibility #1 is the simplest (Occam's razor) but it has already been explored in great detail by my sources.

For this theory, I will look at possibility #5.

-----

### Theory: The plane was found but kept secret.

Consider the following timeline, all times in Alaska Time and sources cited at the end:

* Oct 16, 8:59am – Cessna 310 departs Anchorage for Juneau ([NTSB Aircraft Accident Report](https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR7301.pdf))

* Oct 16, 9:09am – Last known communication with the plane (NTSB Aircraft Accident Report)

* Oct 16, 1:45pm – Search efforts for the aircraft begin (NTSB Aircraft Accident Report)

* Oct 17, 4:30pm – A tipster in California calls the Coast Guard, saying his friend has access to experimental electronic equipment and that the plane is close to Malaspina Glacier. The tipster is very specific, describing the exact location and even the number of survivors. This tip was followed up on and taken seriously due to his rational demeanor and military ties (Missing in Alaska podcast, The Search episode, timestamp 36:45 + [email correspondence](https://i.ibb.co/gMXQQj6/MIA-Email.png) with the host to clarify the likely time of the call)

My theory is that the California tipster was leaked the location of the crash by a friend in the CIA or some other member of the US Intelligence Community. In 1972, the Cold War was in full force and the US Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) network was well developed, including hydrophone arrays along the California coast as well as Adak, Alaska. This is the same Pacific Ocean network that was used to locate the Soviet submarine K-129 four years earlier. From the [SOSUS Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSUS):

&gt; Acoustic data from four Air Force AFTAC sites and the Adak, Alaska SOSUS array triangulated a potential event location to within 5 nautical miles, a site hundreds of miles away from where the Soviet Navy had been searching.

In addition to this network, there appear to be many other SOSUS-related projects that were being tested in the waters surrounding Alaska during that time. This makes sense with how close it is to Russia. Of particular interest are:

* [PARKA II &amp; Sea Spider](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b020846.pdf)

* [Missile Impact Locating System (MILS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Impact_Location_System)

Some of these hydrophone projects may even remain classified to this day, since submarines near the US mainland are still very much a military concern. For that reason, it's impossible to know how sensitive the sensors might be and how close they might have been to the crash site. That said, I think it's plausible that the plane would have been picked up by one of these sensors if it crashed into the water. A good portion (if not most) of the flight path crossed over the water. The CIA wouldn't bother to pour through hydrophone data for any other missing plane but with the House Majority Leader missing, it's almost certain that they would have. They pulled out all the stops for this search, including the SR-71 spy plane and highly classified spy satellites:

* [GIF](https://i.ibb.co/x5NCtk9/KH-9-Oct-17-20-1972.gif) showing 3 groupings (72 photos in total) of the search area taken two days after the plane's disappearance by a KH-9 spy sat. That area of Alaska wasn't photographed by a KH-9 again until four photos were taken in 1976 and the area was never photographed in such detail again during the entire run of the KH-9 program, which ended in 1984.

-----

### Why was it kept secret?

So if the CIA knew where the plane was, why didn't they tell anyone? Well here are the possibilities, assuming the CIA found the plane:

1. There was a bomb on the plane and it was planted by the CIA. The mob had nothing to do with it and the CIA kept the plane secret to cover their operation.

2. There was a bomb on the plane and it was planted by the CIA. The mob was manipulated to make it look like they did it and the CIA kept the plane secret to cover their operation.

3. There was a bomb on the plane. The CIA directly worked with the mob to facilitate the bombing and then kept the plane secret to cover their operation.

4. There was a bomb on the plane. The CIA didn't communicate with the mob but took steps to ensure that the bombing happened and then kept the plane secret to cover their operation.

5. There was a bomb on the plane. The CIA were aware of the plot but let it happen because it benefited them in some way. They kept the plane secret for fear that the high-profile assassination of the House Majority Leader would be blamed on them.

6. There was a bomb on the plane. The CIA was unaware of the plot and kept the plane secret for fear that the high-profile assassination of the House Majority Leader would be blamed on them.

7. There was **not** a bomb on the plane. The CIA found the plane and kept it secret for an unknown reason.

So it boils down to whether there was a bomb on the plane, how involved the mob/CIA was in the bomb plot, and the CIA's motivation for keeping the plane wreckage a secret. Again, I am listing all possibilities for completeness but I think #6 and #7 are by far the most likely. It's possible the CIA actually conspired to bomb the plane but that's a pretty serious accusation. And let's be clear, this is all under the huge umbrella assumption that the CIA found the plane in the first place, which I fully admit is a dubious and unsupported claim.

If the CIA did find the plane, though, I don't think they had any idea it was going to go missing. For evidence of this, look at the [GIF](https://i.ibb.co/x5NCtk9/KH-9-Oct-17-20-1972.gif) I linked to above. You can see that they didn't photograph the Prince William Sound part of the search area between Anchorage and Cordova. That makes me think that they missed the opportunity to photograph that area, since the 16th and 17th would have been the only chance, due to the satellite's orbit. If they had been privy to the bombing ahead of time, surely they would have photographed that area as well.

-----

### Watergate and public perception of the CIA

To recap, I think the most likely of the seven possibilities above is that the mob bombed the plane and that the CIA was able to find it afterwards using high-tech equipment. But that equipment was all highly classified at the time. Even the implication that SOSUS existed would have been a threat to national security. They could have tipped off the rest of the search organizers anonymously but then they wouldn't get any credit for the find. In fact, they would get the opposite since evidence of a bomb on the plane could make it look like the CIA played a part in the demise of the House Majority Leader. In 1972, the CIA was already cast in a bad light because of their role in the Watergate scandal, just four months before the plane went missing. From the [CIA Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency):

&gt; Hastening the CIA's fall from grace was the burglary of the Watergate headquarters of the Democratic Party by former CIA officers, and President Richard Nixon's subsequent attempt to use the CIA to impede the FBI's investigation of the burglary. 

The botched 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion was also lingering and the 70s were generally peak CIA underwater craziness. Case in point, [Operation Ivy Bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ivy_Bells) in 1971 and [Project Azorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Azorian) in 1974. I even checked to make sure they wouldn't have used this occasion as a test run for Project Azorian but the Glomar Explorer didn't leave the East Coast until 1973 (page 22 of [this document](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328278722_Glomar_Explorer_and_Project_Azorian)). No matter though, I'm pretty sure they only would have needed a discrete [tugboat with a crane](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-dania-plane-crash-folo-20160904-story.html) to retrieve a Cessna 310 from the Alaskan waters. The area near Malaspina Glacier (and almost everywhere along the flight path) is very remote and they could have recovered the wreckage without scrutiny. It would have been an absolute cake walk and good salvage practice for the CIA, even without the Glomar Explorer.

-----

### Problems with this theory:

1. First and foremost, the much simpler explanation is that the plane crashed in a hard-to-find place. I realize that but I think I've shown that my CIA theory is at least mildly plausible.

2. I wasn't even alive in the 70s so I won't pretend to know whether the CIA would have been properly motivated to cover up a House Majority Leader plane crash in the way I'm suggesting. I think it's plausible but someone more knowledgable could weigh in on that. I just know they did some crazy stuff back then.

3. The California tipster gave the location of the crash AND the number of survivors. I wouldn't think SOSUS could detect whether there were survivors, much less the *number* of survivors. Maybe there was a hydrophone very close that was able to sense footsteps. Maybe they detected the initial crash with SOSUS and zeroed in with the SR-71 spy plane. Maybe the tipster embellished to give his claim a sense of urgency. Maybe he just misspoke. I don't have the original document so it's hard to look into it any further.

4. There is evidence to suggest that the plane didn't make it out of Prince William Sound, which is only about 100 miles from where it took off in Anchorage, Alaska. The strongest support of this is that there was no radio call later when there should have been if the plane was still flying. There's a few plausible reasons why there wasn't a radio call though and it's really anyone's guess as to exactly how far the plane got. For a detailed breakdown of where the plane might have gone down, see the Missing in Alaska podcast, Tail End episode, 4:37 timestamp.

-----

### Conclusions:

* I believe it is possible that the Cessna 310 that went missing in 1972 with the House Majority Leader on board might have been located by underwater hydrophone sensors that were highly classified at the time.

* If the cause of crash was a bomb, I believe the CIA might have been motivated to recover the sunken wreckage without alerting the public or the rest of the searchers.

* This would fit the reputation of the CIA at the time and it would explain why nothing was ever found.

* It could even explain the discrepancies in the NTSB Aircraft Accident Report, which didn't list the plane as having any ice equipment, as well as the lack of news coverage of the event. The CIA may have tampered with the investigation and suppressed the story.

* I'm speculating here but I think a bomb timer would have been set to go off half way through the flight time, which is approximately where Malaspina Glacier lies along the flight path.

* It's possible that the unconfirmed tail/empennage that was recovered near Hinchinbrook Island in the 80s drifted in the ocean currents into Prince William Sound over the years before being found: [Alaskan ocean current map](https://earth.nullschool.net/#2018/10/19/0400Z/ocean/surface/currents/orthographic=-146.84,58.32,2767/loc=-22.721,16.103).

* This theory unifies the two unlikely events that the plane went missing in the first place and that it was never found. If this theory is correct, a bomb caused the crash and that same bomb is also the reason that the recovered wreckage was never disclosed to the public.

* Here's my [previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/hvwrz5/help_find_a_photo_of_a_plane_that_went_missing_in/) on this topic, if anyone is interested.

### Point of clarification

Before anyone comments that Alaska is huge and remote and this plane could have easily gotten lost forever, I understand where you're coming from and I would intuitively agree. The whole point of this theory though is that it operates on the assumption that the plane should have been found. That way, this theory has already been discussed if new evidence suggests that the plane was in fact located. I don't even particularly believe this theory, that's why I'm calling it a theory and highly speculative at that.

That said, I do think there is substantial reason to believe that the plane should have been found. I'm no expert, I'm just going off of the information in the podcast and the very unambiguous statement by search officials that they had a greater than 95% chance of finding the plane. I don't feel that anecdotal evidence is very relevant. There are plenty of planes that have never been found but those were different circumstances at different times in different places. The only real insight we have as to the chances of finding the plane are the ones given by the search organizers because those people were evaluating the likelihood of finding this particular plane and they had a complete picture of the situation that we just don't have 48 years later.

Short of a new investigation with expert testimony and actual statistical analysis, I'm inclined to believe the quote that I used at the beginning of this post, which claims a 95% or greater chance of finding the plane. The closest thing to a modern analysis of the plane's chances of being found is the Missing in Alaska podcast and the host seems to agree that someone should have found something in nearly 50 years, especially considering the importance of this plane's passengers.

Also, the article I linked to at the beginning is a respectable flying magazine that appears to have worked with the podcast host and they are at least open to the idea that the plane didn't crash due to weather/pilot/mechanical error. The more mundane reasons could very well be the case and I even think it's most likely, I'm just saying it doesn't mean we shouldn't consider more exotic possibilities.",conspiracy

Without a doubt most of us would likely end up on such a list at some point in our lives no matter how brief. Not only that, these decisions are being made without a 2nd opinion-condemning some to death for the mistakes of possible negligent medical evaluation or Dr. 

In the leaked nursing home video from Germany, patients (with Dementia, but in good health otherwise) are forcefully given vaccinations by being restrained or held down by nurses, meanwhile Military personal in camouflage are standing by-but do not intervene. The Vaccine, Phizer's was forcefully adminstered to 31 patients, with-in 5 weeks, 8 have died, all had side effects, many very serious. To be clear, what is shown in these videos, IS ILLEGAL. There are attorneys who have spoken with the whistle blower and have stated they believe what they are witnessing is murders. I disagree, I believe what you are witnessing is a small picture of a worldwide mass murder program ongoing.

Highlights of the video can be seen here, if you are having trouble with 1 there are 2 each posted to a different provider. i reccomend the 1st video, but you might have to press play, and pause it for a couple minutes to buffer do to high demand. video starts at 2:12. below the video links are provided to each and every bit of information  contained within the video if you would like to research any subject deeper.

Over 1,000 deaths and many, many more severe injuries associated with covid vaccines in just two months; media has no problem.","[.](https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/news/india/images/2018/8/3/dead-crime-death-suicide.jpg)

Measles was touted as a national crisis in 2019. The outbreaks of measles made headlines daily.  Measles this and measles that. How many people died of measles in the U.S. during this media-proclaimed crisis?  **Zero**.  Zero people died and yet the media was losing its fucking mind over a total of 1,282 cases of measles across the entire country.  

**In the last two months, how many people have died just hours or days after injection with covid vaccines?**

I think the number of deaths associated with the covid vaccines in just two months has already surpassed the number of measles infections the media was losing its mind over for the entire year of 2019.  

TL;DR

2019:

1,282 measles **infections** and no deaths: media loses their shit.

2021:

Over 1,000 deaths and far more severe injuries associated with experimental covid vaccines in just two months, media ignores it and continues advocating for everyone to run out and get it.",conspiracy

913,The coming economic collapse and the new Monetary system!,"Most people are aware that we are printing money out at an alarming rate! The United States was already trillions in debt before this pandemic so don’t let them tell you the pandemic was the cause. Because it wasn’t! This is happening all over the western world one look at a debt clock for every country will tell you the same thing! The world is in debt! 

Iet me start off by telling you that minimum wage is a joke. The point of minimum wage was to pay a wage that someone could live off. 

Why does minimum wage no longer work? Because of inflation “inflation is where currency is devalued” aka it’s worth less than before. As the value of money drops and minimum wage stagnates it no longer protects you!

What about the 15 dollar minimum wage Bill the democrats are trying to get passed! This is extremely dishonest way of them pretending they actually care!  You see the real issue is inflation has caused the price of things to skyrocket! Our dollars value has been getting so low that if we adjusted for inflation on minimum wage today it would be $30 dollars an hour! Side note congress adjusts its pay according to inflation!

More information on inflation normally when you inflate the money by printing more money that will mean their is more money roaming around in the economy ! However that is no longer the case “look into the Panama papers” I suggest you watch the documentary! There are trillions of dollars being wealth hoarded in offshore shell corporations and bank accounts! So in reality the dollar is devalued for nothing! Their isn’t anymore money out in the wild stimulating the economy! It’s being held to retain its value within the country! 

You are probably wondering what I mean? Well think of it this way. if I print a bunch of money and than allow it to filter it’s way back to me and I have a system of people who hoard it, I can take all the money out of the economy that was printed. 

Yeah so? Meaning among the population the dollar will have the same value just the cost of everything goes up aka you don’t see more money within the system! That’s why they can still pay people 15 dollars when they should be getting paid 30! The dems and republicans are laughing because they printed out half the money we had Circulating in our economy already this year! Meaning the devalued your $15 in half so they are basically fighting to make minimum wage $7.50.

This system is illegal and is probably the most unethical evil thing done to people! But I fear the system is set to collapse! That is what was intended!

If the system was to self correct you would get hyper inflation “ they don’t want this” basically the money becomes worthless and takes a bunch just to buy a loaf of bread! Look up Zimbabwe money! If this happens that means everyone pays off their debt extremely easy! However it requires stupid amounts of money to buy anything aka 5 million dollars for a candy bar! Yeah! The cost or work, homes, cars etc everything goes up! Meaning a normal salary wouldn’t be 30,000 after this shit it! 

They don’t want that to happen debt is what makes you a slave, taxes make sure you can’t hold wealth and that you need to keep working just to stay afloat!

The main point in this! They want to hold onto your debt while the flip the board over and start a new game! And they are going to make you an offer! They are going to settle your debt and make you sign over your rights to own anything! You will have to rent everything! Look up world economic forum “build back better”

This new system you will get is called universal basic income! They will give you money, you can not hold onto money or create any wealth or saving! They want total control over their slaves! In this new system they will adjust value on things! The people who don’t take the deal will be forced to pay back their debt on money that is now worth a lot more! They think this is fair and just! 

You can bet your ass they will issue new laws and policy based on class warfare! The wealthy who stole and cheated and hoarded their wealth will get to keep what they stole and hoarded! It will only keep getting worse with generations! I think the first generation will get treated fairly nice however after 2 more generation they will drive the point home your a slave!
They will take meat away, make people eat ground up bugs “protein”, homes will be basically pods you sleep in. Everything will cost money that you can never own including your carbon footprint which will be the end of the year tax and will adjust to your UBI the next year! Meaning your still in debt slavery!

That’s if you take the deal! If everyone is wise to the game! They don’t win! The game resets itself and the wealth they stole and devalued means nothing! Once the monetary system collapses we have one chance to take everyone of them out of office in every country! Start over with a new system for ourselves!",conspiracy

964,"States that are mandatorily enforced to wear, ""Suffocation Devices,"" aka, ""Masks,"" VS. States that are not mandated to wear, ""Masks.""","This was brought to my attention a few weeks back when I was on Facebook and looking through peoples stories. One person's story that I was looking at, was from a girl I once went to Middle School with in Washington State; she currently resides in Arlington, Texas. 

Her story featured her and her sister at a local bar, tons of people at the venue, and everyone has a drink in their hand, dancing, &amp; having a good time. What struck me, was that no one, NO ONE, not even the bartenders, were wearing masks. I thought to myself, ""god that must be nice! I'd love to go back to a year ago when I wasn't forced to wear a suffocation device."" 

I currently reside in Washington State, and as many are NOT aware of, Washington State's Governor, Governor Jay Inslee (he's a pos weasle of a human being) issued a statewide mandate enforcing everyone to wear masks...everywhere. It's even gone as far as including businesses, government agencies, government buildings, restaurants, gas stations etc. to enforce any and all customers/potential customers to HAVE to be wearing a mask to even be able to enter their establishment. Just about every business in my local &amp; surrounding area(s) have a sign hanging in their window/on their door that states, ""NO MASK, NO SERVICE."" I think it's funny that I no longer see signs that state, ""NO SHOES, NO SHIRT, NO SERVICE,"" but only now see the signs about masks. That leads me to believe that even if one isn't wearing shoes &amp;/or a shirt, as long as they're wearing a mask, they'll be able to have service(s) provided to them and lol 

In tandem with that, I've also noticed a recent up kick in rising, ""COVID-19,"" numbers/death toll, particularly in Pierce County where I reside. I started conducting research on statistics/COVID numbers for States that are mandated to wear masks vs. States that aren't enforcing it's governed to wear masks...and that's when I experienced the damnedest realization: States like WA where I live, have much HIGHER COVID numbers than that of their Southern counterparts, such as: Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, Oklahoma, etc. 

Very ironic that States where they aren't making people wear masks, and it appears that most people aren't, have significantly LOWER COVID outbreaks/numbers than somewhere where its' people are involuntarily forced to wear them. 

So, what does that tell me? It tells me that the CDC is lying to everyone, and that masks did not/do not work LOL

Just for clarification purposes, I was/I am aware that masks, COVID-19, CDC are all a bunch of bullshit.

One last thing to add, and something that's very, VERY creepy - if you go to the Google search bar and type in ""Your City, Your State COVID 33,"" you'll see a TON of news articles for your area that are linked to 33 somehow.

I’ll leave that up to the viewer (though I personally understand it to be a real thing). But what I’m talking about is the blatant ignorance that makes the news/mainstream sources of information these days. There is a lot of criticism against American for its high case rate. Yes the numbers are high, but when you start comparing it to other countries (“America ranks #1 in etc etc) then its ridiculous. How can you rank numbers when countries like Bangladesh only report “5000” cases, a place where people literally live on top of each other? Or China, which is still in the 80,000s? It’s ridiculous, and any other objective ranking would’ve thrown out the entire dataset when huge disparities like that are noticed. 

Yet these are the numbers paraded around. And it’s very interesting that the west has higher numbers, when the very place that the virus is known to have originated from remains low. And if you are to assume that those numbers are somehow authentic (like what the newsmakers seem to be portraying), then it’s still very weird that the traditional advanced countries have the highest numbers.

994,Conspirituality: The Truth of the Inner Reality &amp; the Outer World Are One,"Recently there has been concern by those who love to find things to be concerned about that the realms of spirituality and conspiracy are merging. These people see this as a dangerous trend and a threat to our society.

These people think this way because they understand neither spirituality nor the truth of (some) conspiracies. 

Spirituality and conspiracy theories tend to go together because they are both concerned with finding the truth. 

Spiritual truth is the inner reality of the individual.

Conspiratorial truth seeks to know the outer reality of the society.

For the human being, finding themselves within a strange and mad world while not knowing who they truly are - they are called to walk both of these avenues of truth.

# To Be Truly Awake, You Must Know Oneself AND The Matrix

Spiritual awakening requires understanding the truth of your Self and your world. 

You must know your inner consciousness and also the reality you live within.

If you are not awake to the truth of the world you live in, then you are not truly awake.

And if you are not awake to the truth of your very own self, then you are not awake either.

In the movie The Matrix, Neo took the red pill and woke up to the truth of the world he lived within. But this was just the first step of understanding. 

He was not fully awakened and enlightened as “The One” until he had the inner transformation and came to know who he truly was and that he was the creator of his reality. 

Coming to realize the truth of one’s predicament in this Matrix of the human world on Earth is just the beginning - walking the spiritual path to discover empowerment, liberation, and the truth of life is the real goal. 

# Inner &amp; Outer Truth

When you follow an authentic spiritual path, you learn to question all of what you have believed to be true about yourself.

* You clean up your physical body from ingesting toxins and from engaging in unhealthy habits. 
* You observe your actions, thoughts, emotions, and beliefs to see if they are aligned with truth and what you prefer to be. 
* You undergo a process of unlearning and removing from yourself all the conditioned beliefs about yourself implanted in you from the world around you. 
* You liberate yourself from abusive relationships and relationships founded upon lies, coercion, secrets, etc.
* You leave behind external religion and create/discover true spirituality.

The process of waking up to the truth of the world and therefore transcending it is also the same practice, just applied to the world you exist within.

* You observe the actions, words, and intent behind the structures of power and influence in our world and examine what their true agendas are and the fruits of their efforts.
* You unlearn what you have been taught in school, from the media, from the scientific establishment, from the politicians and realize that not only is what they are saying fundamentally untrue - but the entire system is founded upon lies, a belief in the legitimacy of authority, etc.
* You free yourself from the abusive relationship with your government and other external control systems in your life. You learn to be responsible and sovereign without external dependency.
* You realize that money is a religion, government is a religion, modern science is a religion - all belief systems that, when investigated, are illegitimate and keep humanity enslaved.

The two go hand in hand - inner awakening and outer awakening. Inner sovereignty and outer sovereignty.

The more you do your inner work, the more the external world will become transparent, and you will easily see every person and every system that is out of alignment with Truth. 

# Going Down The Rabbit Hole

When you go truly deep within yourself and this reality, you begin to encounter how truly, “truth is stranger than fiction.”

As you investigate the nature of humanity, our origins, and our current state - you come upon evidence and accounts that point to truths about humanity that would put 90% of people in the hospital in a state of shock and disbelief.

Like people in the Matrix movie, most people don’t want to know the truth, and if they were forced into seeing it, they would deny it, attack the one attempting to show them, and possibly go insane. 

Like Plato’s dwellers in the cave - any reality outside of the shadows upon the wall is laughed off and dismissed as a “crazy conspiracy theory.”

For the one who unshackles themself and walks out of the cave and into the light of day, the true nature of reality is both a spiritual truth and a grand conspiracy.

# All Truths Lead to One Truth

At the deepest level, spirituality and conspiracy combine.  If you investigate either one deeply, you will encounter the other. In investigating the truth of oneself, one naturally comes to see the truth of the world - for the world is a mirror of yourself. 

All the same themes are being played out in the world as in your consciousness. Human beings are struggling with the same things the individual is learning to evolve beyond.  For the collective is a fractal of the individual.

The one with an integrated spiritual insight understands that the human experience is one grand conspiracy on many levels.

They will realize that the world they thought they lived in is the creation of their own consciousness, is a multi-dimensional mirror of themselves. They will see that it is an illusion, a dream, and nothing within it can enslave them other than their belief in limitation and lack. 

They will understand that human beings are conspiring together to create a certain reality-experience here on Earth. For thousands of years, that experience has entailed a group of negatively polarized beings playing the role of rulers and manipulators of mankind.  However, this has been all part of the game, the play, the theatre and served the purpose of learning and exploration. 

That game is coming to a close, and much is being revealed. Hence the rising trend of conspiracies and spirituality merging together and appearing in the mainstream consciousness. 

Conspiracies and spirituality are going mainstream because we are reaching the end of the Grand Illusion - Humanity’s prolonged state of ignorance, hypnosis, and sleep.

We are in the time of The Revealing and The Great Shift, where humanity en masse awakens to long forgotten and suppressed truths and makes a quantum leap in evolution. 

Not all spirituality is authentic. Not all conspiracies are true. 

But it is the nature of our earth experience and the greater reality that everything is both a spiritual experience and a conspiratorial unfolding. These two elements are coming together now in the year 2021 as a central theme in the Story of the New Earth.

[Here goes my diary entry of 23/12/2020]
So, I'm currently in a rental house in India and its 3:48 AM rn. And it is rumored that something known as ""बिना सिर वले घोरे का रक्षक/मालिक"" which translates to The protector or the owner of the headless horse used to appear once in a year and whoever watches it cleaning its horse, dies with a high fever within no time. I was creeped out while listening to the rumors from my roommate, but in the end I laughed it off and said that nothing to worry bout it cause they're just rumors. He said that they aren't just rumors cause there was really a guys whose beloved horse's head was cut of as he didn't pay enough tax. I was totally creeped out upon listening to the rumors and stories. Feeling sleepy GTG, GN 🌑

[Diary entry of the next day]
What I'm saying is that it is a usual trait for Indian Legends to show themselves whenever someone doesn't believe that they did exist, for example we can take the story of Lokenath who was able to see Kaali mata(a goddess) an fun fact, Lokenath was the biggest atheist at that time and within no time he started praying Kaali mata which was a big shock for his family.

1010,"Use of ""spam"" text messages in social engineering.","

Here me out.  Give me a fair shake.  I want an honest, but objective, opinion.

I've been receiving lots of spam text messages lately.  Up until this point in my life, I've never really received spam via text message. Some here and there... Once or two random text messages every few months...but for the last few weeks I've been receiving four or five of them a day.  I try to block the numbers, but they keep coming up.

Since this ordeal started I've just assumed the links had malware or trojans in them.  I don't like them, but I'm not concerned enough to immediately do anything about the situation.  One thing I do notice, however, is that in the back of my mind, I feel like I'm being watched everytime I receive one of these things.  It's very subtle, but the feeling is definitely there.  I also notice that I think twice about what I post online when I've recently received one.


**My question:. Do you think that governments use ""spam"" text messaging systems to influence what people talk about and how people act?**

Like, no viruses or malware, the effects are meant to be purely psychological. Using A.I. and raw facebook data, mixed with camera and microphone data, the process could be automated, targeted, and completely deniable.  It's pretty obvious they can do it, but do they do it.

ORIGINAL POST:

First time poster here.

I don't know if this is a bit off topic maybe but I find it fascinating so I decided to share.

I like reading people's body language and the smile is a big one for me.

The most fun, life loving and positive people have a certain, characteristic smile.

It is all about the eyes. When these people are smiling, their bottom eyelids are making a little arch.

After many years of observation, I can confirm that these are great, pure and just life loving people.

A great celebrity example of that smile would be Emilia Clarke. I don't know her, but I'm sure she's a great person, just judging from her smile.

On the other hand we have, for example, David Miscavige, who is trying very hard, and yet he cannnot mask his dead eye smile.

The same goes with Hillary Clinton and her daughter and Nancy Pelosi (first persons off the top of my head).

You can see that clearly when you cover their smiles with your hand and notice, that the eyes don't match the smile at all. They are unable to fake a sincere smile, no matter how hard they try.

Are they evil? I don't know them. Maybe, maybe not. Fun exercise nevertheless.

I was watching one person's youtube channel because most of what they say is accurate.   But recently I've been getting a bullshit vibe from them.  Because I know how to use my psychic abilities I can usually tell when people are lying or at least repeating information that is bullshit.  And that is the vibe I got from this person.  And this person claims to be psychic and they can't sense that their information is bullshit even though I sense it clear as day.  I don't think so.

So youtube is crawling with shills.  And the one I'm talking about is clearly an outer gate keeper because his knowledge is pretty advanced.  Also he exposed three other shills.  Most likely to prop himself up so he could say I exposed other shills so I""m not a shill.  These people are very very clever  One of them I watched their videos for a decade before he turned and started promoting trump.  And he is another person who should know better.

So the level of bullshit is insane.  The lengths the elite go to try to bullshit people is totally insane.  They must have a government agency that manages these shills.  The department of shill.  It's crazy.  So I am tired of running into shills.  Is there no one who puts out information for the right reasons?  Because there are a lot of shills out there.",conspiracy

Dr. Gideon Polya, an Australian scientist, has for two decades kept track of these numbers as well as recorded the untold horrors of the “9/11 wars.” In June of last year, he published “US-Imposed Post-9/11 Muslim Holocaust &amp; Muslim Genocide.” The book includes forewords by Dr. Kevin Barrett and Søren Roest Korsgaard. Dr. Polya sent over 5000 emails to mainstream media outlets across the world without a single response. He, furthermore, also distributed more than 100 copies of his book to prominent scientists, journalists, politicians, and other people of prominence. Dr. Polya writes, “Despite thousands of Mainstream journalists around the world being informed over the last 40 days, the Silence has been Deafening.” Likewise, the International Criminal Court has likewise ignored repeated formal complaints against the war criminals of the US-Alliance. The short answer is that millions have died from violence or from war-imposed deprivation.

1070,Do you think a public person in the US would have a chance to speak like this? Here is an interesting opinion of a famous Russian director who is also well-known in Europe.," ""Ethical Reich of the West"": stage director Bogomolov wrote a manifesto

**“Modern Russia is certainly far from the Europe it was striving for. But the country obviously does not want to go to a new European freak show”, - Konstantin Bogomolov is convinced.**

**“Due to the coincidence of circumstances, we found ourselves in the tail of a crazy train, rushing into Bosch's hell, where we will be greeted by multicultural gender-neutral devils. You just need to unhook this carriage, cross yourself and start building your own world”, - the stage director said. This is an excerpt from a manifesto entitled ""The Abduction of Europa 2.0"", which Bogomolov wrote and, calling for public discussion, published in** **Novaya Gazeta****. The material contains his reflections on events in Europe, Western values, Russia and the new ethical Reich. We publish it in fragments.**

""... In the XX century, atomic energy, which is a man, went out of control. Nazism became human Chernobyl. The shock and fear of Europe before this explosion of primitive in man turned out to be too great.

Having freed itself from Nazism, the West decided to insure itself against a ""nuclear accident"" by eliminating a complex person.

That complex person whom Europe has formed over the long years of Christianity. The person that Dostoevsky described: both high and low, an angel and a devil, loving and hating, believing and doubting, reflective and fanatical.

Europe was frightened by the beast in man, not realizing that the beast is the same natural and organic part of man as the angelic. Unable to overcome the consequences of Nazism intellectually and spiritually, Europe decided to castrate a difficult person. Castrate his dark nature, immure his demons forever.

At one time, Kubrick shot ""A Clockwork Orange"" - a picture of brutalized young guys who, under the influence of drugs, terrorize London, brutally beating and raping peaceful inhabitants. When the leader of the gang is caught, he is offered to undergo experimental therapy for early release: fixing his eyelids so that they do not close, he is shown scenes of violence for hours to the music of his beloved Beethoven. As a result, the young man does not just get rid of aggression - he is sick of music, he cannot see a naked woman, sex makes him disgusted. And in response to the blow, he licks the boot of the striker.

The modern West is such a criminal who has undergone chemical castration and lobotomy. Hence this false smile of goodwill and all-acceptance, frozen on the face of a Western person. This is not the smile of Culture. It is a smile of degeneration.

**New Ethical Reich**

The West declares itself as a society “sharpened” for the realization of personal freedoms. In fact, today the West is fighting a person as a complex and difficult to control energy. In this struggle, the functions of the court, prosecution and isolation are not eliminated, but delegated from the state to society. The state, represented by the police and security officials, was “humanized” and “humanized”, but the conventionally progressive society took on the role of new storm troopers, with the help of which the same state is super effective in combating dissent.

The modern Western world is taking shape in the New Ethical Reich with its own ideology - “new ethics”. National Socialism in the Past. This is ethical socialism. Queer socialism. Siemens, Boss and Volkswagen turned into Google, Apple and Facebook, and the “Nazis” were replaced by a mix of queer activists, fem-fanatics and ecopsychopaths, just as aggressive and just as thirsty for a total reformatting of the world.

Traditional totalitarian regimes suppressed freedom of thought. The new non-traditional totalitarianism has gone further and wants to control emotions. Restricting the freedom of an individual's emotion is a revolutionary concept in the New Ethical Reich.

Feelings and thoughts have always been a private area of a person. He had no right to let go of his hands, but his heart and brain were free. This was the unspoken social contract of European civilization, which understood man as a vessel of emotions and ideas, where hatred is another side of love - albeit a difficult and dangerous, but a necessary and important part of the human personality.

In Nazi society, a person began to train like a dog to hate others.

In the New Ethical Reich, a person is trained to love and deprived of the right to freely hate.

You can no longer say ""I do not like ..."", ""I do not like ..."", ""I am afraid ..."". You have to correlate your emotions with public opinion and social values.

And social values have become the new Wailing Wall, where every unhappy, offended, or simply dishonest individual can not only bring a note, but also demand from the new God - the Progressive Society - to add his resentment, drama, fear or illness to the list of the new ethical UNESCO, giving it socially significant status, the allocation of a budget for it and the creation of a special quota in all spheres of public life. And anyone who says that offense is not worth a damn, the disease is curable, and personal drama is an intimate question, will become a victim of a powerful repressive machine - that very public opinion.

**Sexual counter-revolution**

The new Reich declared war on death. War to human nature, in which wilting and death are part of an incomprehensible divine plan. The pursuit of eternal youth has become an internal idefix of the new Western society.

And the reason is obvious: death is unpredictable and divine. And queer socialists, like the national socialists, like the communists, do not recognize any other power over themselves than the power of their Idea. Idea and Razio are their God. Or they are Gods themselves and consider man not as a secret, but as an object of experiment, meat. The war against death is a war against the mystery of being. A senseless and stupid war against eternity.

But where there is a war against death as a divine given, as a mystical outcome, a war against life is inevitable. For life is as unpredictable as death. Just as incomprehensible. This means that it is uncontrollable and dangerous.

Europe quickly went from the sexual revolution, which became the new European post-Nazi renaissance, to an all-out struggle with the energy of sex - the most vital, emotional and uncontrollable part of human existence.

For sex is freedom. Sex is a danger. Sex is an animal in man. But most importantly, sex is the birth of Life.

Christianity gave sacredness to the sexual act. Divinity and beauty. Erotica was a piece of art. Desire is a manifestation of inspiration. Sex is the sacred pleasure of Love. Birth is a miracle.

The new Reich considers sex to be a production and the genitals as a tool. And in accordance with the precepts of the socialists of the past and within the framework of the new queer socialism, it socializes the instruments of production and redistributes them, while the production itself optimizes and puts under state social control, making gender irrelevant.

The burnt-out Notre Dame in Paris is not a sign of the fall of Christian Europe under the pressure of Muslim. But a strange and mystical sign of the war of the New Reich with the sacred secret of life and death, revealed in the Cross.

**Borders and a new race theory**

The transboundary nature of society, globalization is part of the creation of a new totalitarian empire. In the old days, a dissident had the opportunity to leave his society and find a new one.

Borders insured the freedom of the individual: the diversity of ethical and value systems created an opportunity for a person to find his own - or one that would accept him as much as possible, or simply not interfere with life - an environment of habitation and realization.

The new ethical empire longs for expansion and unification of societies. Thus, a new global village is created, where the dissenting person cannot hide from the guardians of ethical purity.

Ethical purity has replaced racial purity. And today in the West it is not the shape of the nose and national identity that is examined under the microscope, but the ethical past of every successful individual: is there, in the depths of decades, some at least small but harassment, abuse, or just a statement that does not correspond to the new value system. And if there is, fall on your knees and repent.

**The Europe They Lost**

The revolution isolated Russia from the West for almost a century. Freed from Bolshevism, Russia in the 90s of the last century rushed to Europe. Russia sought acceptance, tried to study, dreamed of regaining the status of a European country. And to regain European values. The values of beautiful pre-war Europe. Europe, which was not afraid of a complex person in all its diversity. Respected his freedom to love and hate.

Europe, which understood that nature created man precisely as a complex, contradictory and dramatic creature, and did not consider herself entitled to interfere with a higher plan. Europe, for which the main value of a person was his individuality, expressed not in how a person has sex, but in how he thinks and creates. And the creativity itself consisted in the creation of pictures, music, texts, and not in reshaping one's own body and inventing new gender definitions.

Russia was looking for such a Europe through the 90s. She herself dreamed of becoming.

Is it necessary today to try to find allies where they do not exist?

Europe - an abandoned and plundered cherry orchard. The Firs are hiding from the crowds of migrants, the Ranevskys are sniffing cocaine for the remains of their health, Petya Trofimov writes Euro-laws, Anya realized that she is a queer person, and the surviving Gayevs, who are old man Biden, mumble their usual words about kindness and justice.

Modern Russia is certainly far from the Europe it was striving for. But she obviously does not want to go to the new European freak show.

Our progressives and Westernizers insist: Russia was and is a country of guards and slaves. This is largely true. But it is also true that long years of life in conditions of lack of freedom, the camp fear, snitching, and also silence and violence as ways of survival and ways of protecting the people from power and power from the people - all this requires not revolutions, but patience and therapy. Lancelot's drama is that he didn't really love either Elsa or those he was trying to save.

I detest the spirit of violence and the atmosphere of fear. But this does not mean that I will accept the transformation of the country of guards and slaves into a country where they knock not from fear, but from the heart, they are poisoned not from denseness, but from enlightenment, where multi-colored (including white) Shvonders from BLM enter houses and require professorship sit on one knee, share living space and donate money to help the starving Floyds.

Russia went through all this in the 17th. Feminitives, and other abuse of language, and an attempt to free oneself from gender or cultural identity, and meetings with discussions of moral character, and the massive demands of workers, and even children betraying their parents - this happened recently in the United States, when a democratic girl gave up their parents, the Trump police, after learning that they participated in the protests and the storming of the Capitol. It was all there. And how amazing it is to see the Western world, as if Vera Pavlovna is dreaming for the first time with sweet dreams, and how strange it is to observe the burning eyes and naive speeches of the new Russian commoners, who are conducting moral terror against dissenting people no worse than street riot police.

And there are many who disagree, and these are not at all ""dense"" orthodox. They are modern, cheerful and free people, educated and successful, open to new things, loving life in all its diversity. Russians, Europeans, Americans, secretly dreaming that these strange and dark times will pass. They are afraid to vote. They are afraid to become targets of network bullying in Russia. To be subjected to moral terror, to lose jobs and funding in the West.

They need support like air. It is necessary that their feelings and thoughts were formalized into a word, and the word was supported by will and organization. This means that it is time to clearly and distinctly formulate a new right-wing ideology, an ideology beyond radical orthodoxy, but strictly and irreconcilably defending the values of a complex world based on a complex person.

Russian raznochintsy tell us: Russia is at the tail of progress.

Not.

Thanks to a coincidence, we found ourselves in the tail of a crazy train, rushing into Bosch's hell, where we will be greeted by multicultural, gender-neutral devils.

This story is about one of them in particular, I'm gonna just call him B.

B was an ex secret service agent for the Clinton Administration. He was very close, enough to tell us that Hillary Clinton treated Bill Clinton like shit. He was also an ex police officer. He is one of the nicest guys I've ever met.

I recall they used to joke about getting a license plate with ""Q"" on it, saying it was a joke because of the way G would say, thank you funny. She would say it like ""than-quuu!"" One day before our time together was up, they pulled up to my house with a decorative license plate on the front of G's car. Just one big fancy letter ""Q."" 

Ok... This may be totally totally coincidental. This was back in 2011. But... B was an ex secret service agent after all. Also I may add, Q-anon started off I think as something true, but I believe it got highjacked by some people along the way. But.. dang.

President Trump clearly claims he defeated 100% of ISIS.  However, [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/world/middleeast/iraq-isis-strategic-dialogue-troops.html) from June 2020 clearly shows that ISIS was active after President Trump's claim of ""100%"" defeat.

By November 2020, ISIS was back in action performing large-scale terrorist attacks such as [beheading 50 people on a soccer field](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13154930/isis-behead-men-mozambique-kidnapping-woman/).

1145,My in-depth COVID theory,"**First, I'd like to remind everyone this is a THEORY, and so I'd like everyone to think about this with a grain of salt and an open mind. I am open for all discussion about my post!**

I'd like to start from the beginning, and talk about COVID itself. Honestly, I just can't say that it IS a manufactured bioweapon with a straight face. It's just too ridiculous and too obvious. However, I'd like to remind everyone that the doctor who first pointed his finger at it was threatened to keep quiet by the Chinese government, which does raise eyebrows. If it were a bioweapon however, I could think of 2 explanations. Firstly, it could be a globally approved bioweapon, developed by the elites to solve the overpopulation/climate change problem in a way that wouldn't cut their wealth. However, it breached containment before it was made deadly. My second thought about this would be that it could be a secret bioweapon, known only to China. China wanted to distract everyone and take over the world. I thought of this because I remembered that at the very beginning of the pandemic, fully equipped hospitals were popping up all over China, constructed in mere days. China was also the very first country to have the spread mostly under control. This effort might've been their realization that this was a now or never situation, and that if they recovered quickly they could start taking over. I mean, they weren't assembling the world's largest military for nothing, right? However my main take is that COVID is a virus with a natural origin that was being researched in the Wuhan laboratory, and once it was found out how contagious it was, it was pointed out to the authorities. Their government didn't want to cause mass panic, so they tried to solve it in silence, but it got out of control.

I personally think that governments are being absolutely incompetent on purpose. You know how they change the laws and restrictions day to day, often justifying them very vaguely, and sometimes even putting laws into effect that completely contradict other ones? In my mind, this is some form of ""spread control"". What I mean is that they balance the restrictions to keep an amount of the virus in circulation, while keeping fatalities at a near minimum as to not cause further panic. But why would they do this? It's very profitable! So much money to be spent by everyone to purchase things such as masks and sanitizers, only to be then framed ""obsolete"" to mandate a new required thing which people need to have, which means more sales, and more money. If we were to go back to the first theory about what is the purpose of the virus, you could have this same balancing concept except you'd replace profit with population reduction.

Now about another idea involving China. You know how nearly every country owes massive amounts of money to China? Well what if China suddenly went like ""okay, time to pay up""? This could explain why every single thing is being made so expensive and some things (for ex. US tax on online shopping) heavily taxed. Your government wants to strip you of all of your money to pay back their debt.

How about we talk education? You know how everyone's grades dropped once schooling went online? Hell, even my teacher told me EVERYONE's grades plummeted. My idea is that with all this ""new normal"" stuff and everyone accepting this, we can assume that our current lockdown way of living is most likely intentionally extended for as long as possible to decrease people's intelligence. We could argue that this is the intention, as we've seen that so many uneducated people have started arguing and hating each other for such petty things in the last few years. Not to mention the questionable praise given to people doing stupid things on social media. Who's to say the elites aren't boosting their attention to encourage others to follow in their prints? After all, people who know nothing are very easy to control. And if you wanted to go really crazy about this, you could say this was planned waaay ahead of time with the rise of mindless entertainment.

One thing I find sketchy about this whole thing is just how much hatred is directed at people who do not support 100% of all COVID regulations. Not wearing your mask outside? Careless asshole (please wear your masks indoors and avoid crowding). Not willing to be vaccinated? Selfish prick. Having questions about this entire movement? Crazy idiot. What baffles me the most is how most people argue that unvaccinated people should be outcasted from society, being forbidden to go literally anywhere. The amount of aggression surrounding this whole topic is very offputting. It almost feels forced. I would also like to mention Israel's new claim at having a cure for COVID (articles [here](https://www.theweek.in/news/health/2021/02/10/what-is-israels-miracle-drug-inhaler-treatment-for-covid-19.html), [here](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9228317/Experimental-cancer-drug-hailed-coronavirus-cure-Israeli-hospital.html), [here](https://thestreetjournal.org/2021/02/israel-develops-drug-that-can-cure-covid-19-in-four-days/), and [here](https://www.israel21c.org/has-israel-just-found-the-cure-for-covid/). If that's not enough for you, search ""israel covid cure""). Now it is a very recent claim, and as said there haven't been enough tests to confirm it's effectiveness, but if it ever became a viable solution, we should not be forced into vaccination which is incredibly expensive and most likely being artificially made scarce, like diamonds or insulin.

I know everyone here is really sold on climate change, but doesn’t it make you a little bit suspicious that all of the proposed changes to battle climate change essentially boil down to mass theft from the public of land, freedoms, and generational wealth?

The world has went through cyclical climates before and it has never been proven past the point of anecdotal evidence (there is more C02 and the climate has gotten warmer, therefore correlation=causation). The definitive claim that climate change is man made and caused by C02 emissions just cannot possibly be made with the information being presented from the scientific community.

I think that climate change is a total sham to justify mass redistribution of wealth, making us live like peasants while Bill Gates gets to fly around in his private jet emitting 100% the C02 of your average Joe. They get wealthier and have to make zero changes, but us owning a home or eating a lifetimes worth of meat is going to end the world?

1160,There’s a scene in the movie “Shooter” starring Mark Wahlberg that possibly gives us a hint on how the JFK assassination really played out.,"So I remember watching the movie Shooter starring Mark Wahlberg, which was a great movie by the way, and there was one scene that always caught my attention, if you have seen the movie then you might know what I’m talking about, it was that one scene where the president is about to make a speech and he is with the archbishop of Ethiopia, and Mark Wahlberg’s character Bobby lee swagger, who I think was supposed to be based on Lee Harvey Oswald, is hired by some government agents, to observe the area on a rooftop for a possible assassin or assassination attempt, the actual assassin then fires a shot which hits the president, then suddenly a police officer shoots swagger, to make it appear that he was the shooter and to make the cop look like he was a hero, then the government agents then get a rifle out and put swaggers fingerprints on it to basically frame him for the assassination. Swagger survives being shot, but he eventually goes on the run with the whole country thinking he is the actual suspect.

I think this is similar to what happened to Lee Harvey Oswald, and could also prove the second shooter theory. Now obviously this was just a movie, and a lot of the other scenes where more over the top action for entertainment purposes, but I think this scene in particular gave us a hint about what really happened on that day through media and entertainment, sort of like predictive programming and how it predicts future events, but I think in this case it was to show us what really happened through a form of entertainment, but people won’t suspect it because it’s just a movie.

I believe similar things also happen with mass shootings, where a professional firing squad executes a bunch of civilians, then they eventually frame a suspect that they have on their radar.

I know these theories such as the JFK assassination and mass shootings is something that we all know happened differently, but these are such big events, where the truth about it is being told in plain sight, and aside of assassinations and mass shootings, there have been movies and shows that have even hinted that the Covid 19 pandemic would eventually happen, I believe one of those movies was called Contagion, which showed a lot of situations that have been happening during the pandemic.",conspiracy

1170,"Race is a construct used by elitists to divide and conquer. Nobody used to call themselves white or black. They identified with their culture, which are learned behaviors. Elitists forced the switch to “races”. More below","TLDR below 

The idea of race has nothing to do with real science or knowledge. Many will point to things like mixing with other hominids as evidence of race.

For example Neanderthals lived mostly in Europe so they try to associate having the 1-5% Neanderthal DNA with being “European”. 

But the problem is that nature doesn’t create borders. The original “Europeans” have been proven to have brown skin and been from Africa.

After we evolved out of Africa everything else were environmental adaptations and things of consequence.

All humans are mixed with different groups. Nobody is “pure”. 

The notion of race comes from around the Colonization era and retarded eugenecists.

For clarity let me explain my families history.

I’m Puerto Rican, which is a culture not an ethnicity or race.

People in the Caribbean are some of the oldest victims of colonization.

The Spanish took slaves from west Africa and brought them to the Caribbean to mine gold and silver.

Rather than identify them by their cultural or tribal names, they called these Africans a color to dehumanize them.

They called these people negros, the Spanish word for black.

Eventually Tainos, indigenous people of the Caribbean, began freeing these slaves and welcoming them into their culture.

Many Spaniards who arrived disagreed with slavery and freely joined the Tainos and freed slaves.

They began using the dehumanizing term of “negro” as a term of endearment.

To this day people of Puerto Rican descent use negro as a term of endearment.

Regardless of appearance this term is used.

Puerto Rican’s that look “Indian”, “white”, “black”, and even many Japanese who have lived on the island for decades, use the term.

It’s evidence that race is nothing.

If you “mix races” you immediately can’t tell where someone is from.

Because the genetics that make up what you look like are not static.

We should ignore made up concepts like race. We should focus on the stuff that is real that we can positively effect like culture and behavior.

The one thing we all are is human. That’s what we should focus on. Treat people like individuals and try not to lump people together.

Anytime people begin to believe in massive generalizations or stereotypes, they’re doing the bidding of elitists and scumbags

TLDR: the idea of “Hispanics” is evidence that race doesn’t actually exist but learned behaviors do. We all have more in common with other working class people regardless of “race” than we do with elitists of our same “race”. We should focus on our behaviors and values rather than facial features and complexion.",conspiracy

1188,Media hounding celebrities over sexual orientation.,"Yesterday on Snapchat, I saw a headline on one of the channels that you can subscribe to, that Zendaya (a 24 yr old American actress) just “revealed” her sexual identity. 
Curious, I decided to watch, since from all I’ve seen of her, she seems to be a straight cis woman. They showed an interview with her, in which they claim she “came out”. Well in the interview, the interviewer asks “what is the most important quality in a man”, to which Zendaya says before answering “well let’s say the best quality in a *person*”.  To me, that little retort was akin to Rihanna saying in an interview, “a man? I’m not looking for a man”, when an interviewer asked what qualities she was looking for in her next man. When RiRi said this, it was a woman empowerment moment, not a Segway into questioning her sexuality. (Rihanna moment happened a few years ago). 

Basically, I think Zendaya was just trying to point out that just because she is a young actress, doesn’t mean she needs a man to be associated with, and that she is independent. When she corrected the interviewer to say “person”, she was just trying to say that her mind is not set on a man, and that just being a good person, is the main requirement for her to want to associate with you. Today, a saw another headline stating the same thing as the last, from a different source. 

I’m not complaining about this not being “news”. Even though I’m 23, I know that this sort of thing has been happening forever. Pink news and E! Are not the same as reputable news sources, and their business is reporting on celebrity news and gossip, which is fine. However, why are they taking what a young girl said, out of context?

If she were not straight and cis, I feel like this would be pushing her to come out, which is messed up. Shouldn’t people be allowed to come out when they feel ready? Not because they’re being put in articles in the news and have to address it? Why are they pushing so hard for a woman that has been seen dating a male costar in the past, to be anything other than straight? 

If Zendaya is actually gay/bi/queer, it really doesn’t matter. Which should be the point of the lgbt movement right? To be treated just as straight people are, just like a person who’s sexuality doesn’t define them. Someone telling you their sexual orientation shouldn’t get a more strong reaction then them telling you their name when you ask. However, the media is making it a HUGE deal, which like, why are they pushing it so much? 

I guess what I’m trying to say/ask, is why is the media pushing for these young celebrities to be queer? I feel like the majority of the population is straight and cis. All of my close friends and family are straight, and sometimes I wonder if that is the odd thing, since that’s not what’s shown in media, but deep down I know that that isn’t the case from what I see in day to day life.

The term ""denier"" has become increasingly fashionable to discredit any position TPTB are opposed to. The term seems to have been popularized by the emotionally-charged phrase ""Holocaust denier"" and subsequently the term ""denier"" has been applied to various positions to subliminally insinuate that they morally equivalent to denying the Holocaust and endorsing Nazism. Since being labeled a Nazi is today one of the most dangerous things for a person's livelihood, reputation and personal safety, the implicit threat is obvious: don't be a ""denier"" if you know what's good for you. 

Terms like ""climate denier"" and ""vaccine denier"" don't even make syntactic sense, but they don't have to. The word ""denier"" is used to shut down all debate. Either you agree 100% with the Narrative as pushed by the billionaire-controlled media, or you are an anti-science loony and probably a fascist. The social stigma associated with the word ""denier"" is often enough to scare people into not questioning what they are told, even when it explicitly conflicts with what they were told previously. The term ""mask deniers"" has started to pop up, but less than a year ago this was the exact position publicly advocated by Dr. Fauci and many others.

They realised these leaks got out and want him removed from the media coverage!!!

1202,"Conspiracies are real, and I'll elaborate on why","**The situation we find ourselves in**  
So most of you are here now because you believe in conspiracies.  The spectrum on this is you believe they are deeply affecting your life at this moment or to the most mundane you've noticed a ripple in the matrix and get a kick out of noting further ripples.

Why do current events seem like conspiracy?  Why was 2020 peak clown world?  Why do these things keep occurring and why do they seem to be *behind the scenes*?

Let me share an analogy with you to put you in the correct frame of mind.  I'm a deer hunter.  I sit in blinds when I hunt and I'm basically invisible to the deer in front of me, honestly the blind isn't even needed if I'm still though.  Deer mainly interact with their world via their nose and their ears.  Deer have glands all over their bodies which they use to communicate with other deer.  Compared to humans their visual acuity sucks.  If you are stationary in the woods you are basically invisible to deer, but if you begin moving they'll lock on to you.  If you make certain sounds they'll lock on.  Their ears actually rotate nearly 180 degrees and they can pinpoint sound sources in an almost 360 degree manner.  

One more analogy.... How many times have you seen 1 way glass in a movie... especially in interrogation scenes.  A police officer questions a suspect in a room, but a group of individuals watch behind 1 way glass....

**Your worldview feeds your understand of the situation**  
Take those two analogies and consider who you are.  What is your nature?  If you consider yourself a materialist you believe only in physical reality.  If you have a more classical understanding of human nature you may consider yourself a dualist, perhaps if you are deep into Christian theological traditions you may actually believe in the ""tripartite"" nature of man.  I'm really not trying to delve into strong and weakpoints of particular worldviews but its worth noting it really wasn't until the late 1800s that the materialist worldview caught on in society.  Its worth noting that the bulk of human experience... at least that which has been recorded in text, glyphs and song came from humans who believed in the immaterial....

**Why conspiracy is a thing**  
At its most basic definition a conspiracy is where there are conspirators.  And I can assure you there are a group of conspirators that are orchestrating your very lives.  They are behind the scenes and if you can interact with them its limited yet if they wish to interact with you they can.  The top tier is not the deep state, the top tier is not the NWO, the top tier is not even the illuminati, the top tier is basically something written about in some of the oldest literature known to man.  The origin of the top tier is not *cosmological*, it is **dimensional**.

Lets get our definitions straight  
I'm going to lose some of you here because you don't like the people associated with these ideals.  You don't like the Abrahamic religions, you don't like Christians, you don't like hypocrites and hypo-religious peoples.  That's fine, but look past your pre-conceived notions for a moment.  Some of you are Democrats but you don't shirk the entire party because they elect a tranny for an office of healthcare that wants elementary school kids to get sex changes, some of you are Republicans but you don't shirk the party because some people stormed the Capitol, some of you Catholics but you don't shirk the church because some priests diddled some kids... those might be terrible examples, but you get the point.  The fact of the matter is the subjects I'm about to speak on have deeply affected the human experience, they are the bedrock of our history and their context due to their *chronological* position may give us insight that we don't have with our modern understandings.

**The top tier are what is known as the ""ben elohim""**  
I've prepped you and here is where I'm throwing the grenade.  In the Old Testament there is a phrase that is used... ""ben elohim"" translated as ""sons of God"".  The sons of God is a descriptive phrase used to describe an entire created order of creatures that has a different nature than the one you are intimately familiar with ""ben adam""... mankind or a son of man.  The sons of God are in the same dimension of God, they converse directly with God and they have been given control over areas of the Earth.  This has been the case since man attempted to be like the sons of God... either advertantly or inadvertantly (however you want to look at it).  This has been the case since whatever even transpired at Babel where God confused our universal language and destroyed our universal attempt at not following his desire for us to multiply across Earth and subjugate it.  In Genesis chapter 11 it says ""go to, let US go down and confound their language"", referring to the Sons of God.

The conspiracy within the conspiracy  
The largest conspiracy is the one within the very Church (I'm not speaking of the Catholic Church, I'm speaking of the global group of those who follow Jesus Christ... the word ""Church"" never once refers to a building in the Christian text, nor does it ever lend itself to a specific governing body).  For the 1st centuries followers of Jesus they would have been intimately familiar with the ""ben elohim"".  It was written in to their Septuagint (The greek translation of their Old Testament scripture), it was the understanding of 1st Century Jewish contemporaries such as Flavius Josephus, even the apostles Jude and John understood it.... but here in 2021 I know many, many Christians who will not allow mention of the sons of God in bible studies, they refuse to discuss immaterial things pertaining to this but they will discuss the virgin birth (isn't that strange).

Perhaps its as simple as our very English translations of our sacred texts were inadequate or corrupted.  Take the following verse:  


\---------------------------

***Deuteronomy 32:8 (KJV)***  *When the Most High divided  to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam,  he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children  of Israel.* 

But read the same verse in a newer translation that was translated with the most recent historical literature (the Dead Sea Scrolls)  


***Deuteronomy 32:8 (ESV)***  *When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he divided mankind,he fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God* 

\----------------------------

Wow.  How can two texts be so different.  Our seperations, our boundaries are not set by some Jewish precedent... they are set according to the number of God's divine court.

**Some takeaways**  
For those of you who are hearing this for the first time there is much to learn.  If you have a thirst for knowledge, seek and you'll find it... you'll find it in abudance.  After 2020 many of you are in a receptive state for this knowledge because you seen how the systems of mankind fail.  We are being controlled by the sons of God.  If some system of man is currently controlling us it has only been granted that authority by these beings.  Of the sons of God there is one who is unique.  There is one who is in accordance with what God truly wants for mankind.  I'll let you guess who that son of God is.  

I've shared enough that those who wish to learn more will and those whose minds are closed and already aligned with the sons of God who rebel will only have their minds closed further.

\- Strong's Hebrew/Greek Concordance  
\- The Unseem Realm by Michael S. Heiser

The Left/Right paradigm is a divisive mechanism, the presidents are just “actors” that pretend to hate each other.","Banking interests controlled Trump, Obama, Biden, Clinton, Reagan, Bush etc. This can be easily proven by observing their cabinet picks which consist of people from the same criminal interests.

At the upper echelon, there is actually no animosity between the global superpowers (China, Russia, US). The criminal corporate banking enterprise owns and determines the policy of these countries and they convene to establish a totalitarian world government system. But they need the serfs (us) to think that there is global tension and competition and completely oblivious to the idea of some mass global collusion among the financial and industrial interests of the world. 

They don’t want everyone figuring out that it’s extremely simple and that all we need to do is unite against them and acknowledge that we share a common oppressor.

But instead, idiots seem to emotionally invest in the puppet show of Trump vs Biden or China vs US, etc. This global criminal enterprise I’m describing is using this pandemic as a pivot point to start ushering in the overt global government measures. It’s not some hoax created by “muh democrats” or China to oust Donald Trump. The elites are benefiting from COVID on a *global* scale. To think that this was all created to just to influence our petty political puppet show here in the United states? That’s fucking stupid and you’re coming from a place of small minded partisan competitive thinking with that mentality. 

If you really believe that, it communicates that you’re still emotionally invested in the “theatre” and you haven’t divorced yourself from the bells and whistles of the distracting and divisive mechanisms. Odds are you didn’t even arrive at that conclusion on your own, you heard someone else mention it or saw it posted by an agent provocateur on this forum. Think for your fucking self, don’t just regurgitate what your circle of friends think or what you saw on this sub.

1239,"[Meta] Reminder, it's easy to ignore good posts that have zero upvotes. So make sure to upvote them even though they seem to stay at zero after you do.","Musings:

The reason this sub stays up is because of how it's built IMO.

New (bullshit) posts wash-out existing (good) posts and push them down the page. Couple this with paid downvoters/shills and you get an environment where great posts stay at zero. I admit myself, it seems like a human condition to look at the zero upvote tally and ALSO not upvote it even though it deserves it. I think subconsciously the ""0"" compels you to NOT vote on it or even OPEN the post to read it if you see a zero next to the title. That's been a reason of mine why they shouldn't allow downvoting (but they do for a reason) - other subs *don't* allow downvoting for the reasons I state.


Again, they know this, and that's why the page is built this way. Weird memes and screencaps of a tweet sentence get 124 upvotes in ten minutes, but posts with great salient points are at 0-2 upvotes all day and don't budge. This is in part because you've been conditioned by the non-reacting upvote counter - where any time you attempt to upvote something at zero, it *always* stays at zero regardless if it's legit or not. I don't want to argue semantics, it's just the way it is 99% of the time. Posts at zero upvotes STAY at zero after you hit upvote. &lt;shrugs&gt;


So to recap imo, you've been trained to not bother upvoting things at zero. And your brain wants to *naturally* avoid things that are at zero. And it's funny how fast a (good) new post will go to zero out of the gate and may never go back up. Seems like the *downvote* button worked like a charm there! Within 1 second of hitting ""submit"", the bitch is at zero. Hmm.. lol

And don't bother commenting that votes don't matter to you - that's for a different thread altogether. We *know* that's the case for some people. Not focused on those people here. Cheers!",conspiracy

They temporarily banned me for sharing all this over there, so you know I hit a nerve. For your perusal, I submit to you, the Honk War:

Secondly, I will link something called ""The Gentleman's Guide to Forum Spies,"" with which I know for a fact, that several of the mods over at r/conspiracynopol are well-acquainted—at least one has admitted as much in a comment:

https://pastebin.com/irj4Fyd5

Thirdly, with context from the above article and ""guide,"" I shall next link a couple–quite frankly–revealing posts that should illuminate the malicious and compromised behavior of the mod team:

Now, as you can see, JLB has been engaging in suspicious behavior for at least 4 years. There is a precedent. I am not blowing smoke. I am whistleblowing. I am merely attempting to draw attention to the fact that not only is his being a mod a conflict of interest (because he actively promotes his extra-Reddit responsibilities on the sub), but that the mods also engage in disengenuous and sometimes even malicious behavior.

1299,I wish there are benevolent aliens who actually intervene with Earth matters,"I believe there're bad aliens working with evil Elites. But I wish there were also good aliens who actively helping us right now, not just spiritually but with actual techs and interventions.

I'll just narrate my thoughts. Until early modern era or Middle Ages, life of common people were horrible. Most historical fictions are literally fictions, romanticized like 300%. Real commoners didn't have sewer system till 18-19th century, kings and lords didn't live that much 'good' life either. Richard I died because churches forbade any medical knowledge which didn't come from the bible, Medieval doctors didn't know how to treat king's wounds. Life before modern days was like, whatever you imagine it was worse than that.

Until people discovered the existence of Vitamin C, countless sailors and soldiers died from scurvy. I've read a history article that their number was more than the death from war they fought. .....Still some people get scurvy when their wife is out of town(real story from a redditor), eat some fruits, guys.

Anyway, after this savage stage, suddenly humans developed techs, science, humanities out of blue. Is that just because human race just Woke Up one day on their own? Or did somebody teach us something? Did somebody intervene because we were so savage and ignorant?

Of course there were a lot of geniuses in each era. But many of them said they got the idea or imagination from their dreams or some enlightenment. It's common that those famous people write at least one story about their experience of how they 'received' ideas from 'heaven' 'dream' 'god'.

I don't believe conventional concept of god anymore. I think aliens are highly evolved intelligent beings, and some of them would look like god.

Those typical Grey type aliens aren't original form of aliens(I guess). I've read about them that they had to mutate because their planet was destroyed by some weapon. Original humanoid aliens looked like us, more exactly, Greek gods were aliens. (It's a theory, not saying it's fact)

There're good/neutral/bad aliens according to people who claim they talked with aliens.

Well, then, I really wish good aliens are actually working against Elites, right now, before elites do more sinister things to us.",conspiracy

1308,The American credit score system has reached peak stupidity. Apparently you can pay money to raise your credit score now.,"I  just saw a commercial for Experian's boost which is a product of theirs  that raises your credit score by adding your bank account and things  like utility bills being paid on that account will boost your score.

[https://www.cnbc.com/select/experian-boost-adds-hulu-disney-plus-hbo-starz-to-eligible-streaming-services/](https://www.cnbc.com/select/experian-boost-adds-hulu-disney-plus-hbo-starz-to-eligible-streaming-services/)

Well now they have it where having a streaming service such as Netflix, Hulu, etc will also boost your score.

While  this may not sound like a bad idea at first, utility bills are usually  unavoidable while a streaming service is something in addition to pay  for.

While some of you may disagree, this quite literally sounds like paying money to raise your score.

I also see some conflict of interests and possible legal issues as well.

First,  many banks are still not supported by boost. My Credit Union has many  locations across the state and they are not on their list. I emailed  them when boost launched over 2 years ago to add them, and it's apparent  they do not care.

So who you bank with is being preferred. IF you do not bank with one of their accepted banks, no boost for you.

Second,  like I mentioned earlier this sounds like paying to raise your score.  Because they are advertising that by subscribing to a streaming service,  which has no indication whatsoever of your credit worthiness, your  credit score will raise.

It is  entirely possible that Experian is receiving a kickback of some sort  from streaming providers by literally advertising that purchasing a  streaming service will be of benefit to your credit score.

What's  keeping them from expanding on this and saying a membership to Planet  Fitness or AAA will also raise your score? Again, purchasing these  products do not show credit worthiness and the only benefit of Experian  doing something like this would be a financial incentive from those  mentioned companies.

I've also been a firm believer that if something is free, then the product is *you*.  You are giving this company open access to your bank account and you  cannot tell me they aren't keeping this data somewhere. Companies would  be willing to pay big bucks to see the financial purchases and spending  habits of consumers.

Also, if  using boost can raise your score by an average of 13 points (their  data), then this also creates bias because the other two credit bureaus  (Transunion, Equifax) do not have such a program.

As  we all know, having a higher score means lower interest rates, so if  the loan product or credit card you use is not based on Experian, well  sucks to be you I guess.

I'm  sorry, but this is going entirely above and beyond the scope of what a  credit bureau should be doing, especially when paying for a  non-essential service is now increasing of your supposed credit  worthiness and I think this is going to become a problem in the next few  years without some oversight.",conspiracy

The real conspiracies are the ones that people don't get the kick out of. People think that every conspiracy is a big plot by the government that needs to be uncovered, some ultra-classified knowledge that would flip the whole world upside down if stumbled upon. Some blood-curling revelation that divides people into ""woke"" and ""sheeps"".

The real conspiracies are lies sprinkled in with some truth. A simple cause and effect with no complex agenda behind it. Something that is hiding in plain sight. Something that people dismiss, because it's ""unexciting"". Stuff that people overlook.

*Traffic lights being inefficient on purpose to make you waste fuel.*

*Food expiry dates being set on earlier dates than the real expiry date to make you buy food more often.*

*Software updates crippling your device to pressure you buying into a new one.*

*Planned obsolescence with modern tech.*

*Making shit lightbulbs that don't last long (age of LED bulbs with excuse of efficiency).*

1320,Wild idea about the mrna vaccine; millennials want the boomers to die,"The 2nd dose is killing lots of old people, those pushed way past the working age and living on social security and stuff.

*God*

-Either extremist, colonization person, or runaway. (Perhaps mix of all)

-From an advanced race of preexisting human before Earths, with a few dozen thousand followers. 

-Exercised monitor and control of race of men, and also his holy subjects. 

-Probably use a nearby less hospitable home planet or very large cloaked space ship as home base of operations

-As an advanced people with seemingly limitless life, or at least hundreds of thousands of years, it might be suggested that these are either a human race that has moved to cybernetic bodies or a race that has abandoned organic bodies as useless for anything but breeding and culturing people before processing into inorganic cybernetic bodies. 

-there are already preexisting theories that if aliens do exist they will have probably already abandoned organic planets and live on one massive ship/spherical energy machine/whatever that feeds off of stars (like earths sun for example) 

*Azazel*

-Either extremist, colonization person, or runaway. (Perhaps mix of all). What is known is he was a devout follower of God and then expressed a want to be just as him in a way and decided to go to Earth so he could play Gods role relatively unnoticed (or didn’t care and just wanted to do it, maybe cracked under pressure at home operations if they were indeed long living humans living in exile)

-From an advanced race of preexisting human before Earths, with a couple hundred followers. 

-Exercised manipulation through gifts and hedonism of race of men, and also his holy subjects. 

-May have wanted to create progeny for the sake of returning to a more natural life. Or alternatively wanted to spawn an army. And raise his own legions of subjects. 

-Knowing that God could not just forsake the planet or it’s sun, he was placing all these decisions on pretty tactically weighed odds. 

-Probably use a nearby *inhospitable* home region/mountain and/or very large cloaked space ship as home base of operations.

*Enoch*

-One of the original bloodline from Adam. Adam was created by god for unknown but speculative reasons (science, planetary preparations for colonizing, viewing pleasure, etc)

-Knows of the advanced beings and worships them

-Takes advantage of knowledge passed from Azazel and his peers

-Manipulates Azazel pushing him further from god and the Watchers

-Gains favor from Watchers (probably for his ability to dupe the 200 Watchers who rebelled from the home operations by presenting the visions given to him as an opportunity to manipulate his own status among them

-Gets ride from Watchers in what’s pretty clearly described as a ship that goes to space 

-Meets god, just to prove gods a good guy and not the bad guy like Azazel and guys said. Enoch knows what’s what. 

-Enoch is valued for his intellect and is probably observed as a pinnacle creation by god (especially if he was maybe trying to breed super soldiers with shorter easy to control life spans by using the Watchers DNA) 

-Enoch ultimately becomes recognized/accepted as a Watcher himself and is given some treatment to take his spirit or whatever and placed in an all living body like the advanced peoples (watchers). Probably a synthetic cyborg body that contains a humans consciousness. (Maybe “God” is like a super control unit that has ultimate control over the advanced peoples cybernetic bodies and maybe partially manipulates their minds as well. Like if skynet was less military and more dictorial. 

-Enoch becomes Metatron 

Based on this won’t Enoch/Metatron ultimately follow in Azazel and God’s example..Flee the solitude and control that God has over everyone? Maybe even through immortality and sheer genius find a way to seize control from God and reconnect us with the home world of the advanced society?  Would they be the people left from the original organic hole world?

If this were to happen would we be welcomed or destroyed like an unapproved science project gone wrong?

And if they had knowledge of a attack why alert the world? 

This screams Civil War. There is no attack because they been crying wolf 2 times now. They claimed they needed the 26K National Guard for Inauguration and Impeachment. Both events have come and gone. And nothing happened. 

So they announced a new one. Pelosi has already stated they want a new “Domestic War on Terror”. That’s code for Civil War. Democrats are declaring War on 75 million Americans. They can’t stand that Trump survived all 4 years in power. They can’t stand that he ended his Presidency without conviction. They can’t stand that he was even elected in the 1st place over Queen Killary who should be in her 2nd term. 

And if there is supposedly a terror attack on the Capitol why did we hear about this information from the Capitol Police Chief? Last I checked Capitol Police ain’t part of the Intelligence Community. So how would they know about this attack? Doesn’t the Secret Service do all the VIP Protection? This is there department. And I’m pretty sure they are pissed that this information is public knowledge. 

And since this information is public knowledge Shouldn’t the FBI make a big speech about it like they did after the Jan 6th “Insurrection”?

They are itching to sign Patriot Act 2.0 to take away more of our rights and blame it on Trump Supporters. Because of the violent “militias” which are constitutional protected. Plus with the forever lockdowns politically targeting businesses that aren’t Left/Democrat leaning like Restaurants, Gyms, Churches, and Hair Cut Salons.

=======Remember what the Word of God says:====

\[What Sin Is..\] ***1 John 3:4***

***Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law, for sin is the transgression of the law.***

\[God Is Perfect...\] Matthew 5:48

Be ye therefore perfect, ***even as your*** ***Father who is in Heaven is perfect.***

\[His Way is Perfect....\] 2 Samuel 22:31

“As for God, ***His way is perfect***; the word of the Lord is tried; He is a buckler to all them that trust in Him.

\[Jesus was without sin....\]Hebrews 4:15

For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted as we are, ***yet without sin.***",conspiracy

1384,Biden has barely acknowledged what happened in Texas,"The conspiracy is that his lack of fucks wouldn't be tolerated with any administration in the past. I mean Democrats and Republicans alike.

 He declared a state of emergency in TX which is obvious, like if you or I were president and had no idea what we were doing *we* would do that because it's obvious. Besides that... really, where is he? Texas is the biggest state and has an enormous population. Millions were without power. At least 30 people are dead but that number is expected to rise as more investigating into deaths/injuries occurs. Multiple sources say that, it isnt fringe stuff. Grocery stores did not have food. I believe food is being restocked now. People's water was contaminated and they were advised to boil it, but people who use gas stoves couldn't boil the water because there was no gas. This is a literal catastrophe. He's ""planning"" to go to Texas and he literally said he won't go if he'll be a burden. He said that... what the fuck. Does he realize he's president when he's saying these things? Most of all I want to know WHAT he is doing for the people of Texas. He could have easily arranged for air drops of food, batteries, heaters, and water. In the least, he should be facing us as Americans, especially Texans, and putting forth a message of solidarity and strength. Instead he's hiding out like always. Yes it's a funny meme haha he's in the basement but like... now we know he's definitely staying in that basement even when it's dire. And no one seems to be particularly angry about that.

Bidens speech ability has now degraded to the point that he sounds noticably less fluent and very different from a few years ago.

1413,Frequencies and their effect on high energy events in the form of coincidence,"I’m having a hard time putting this into words, so I apologize if the title doesn’t make sense, but I just had a thought pop into my head recently. 

I’m a total believer in energies. Some people or places give off positive vibes, some negative. Let’s say these vibes are LITERALLY vibrations, is that what vibes is short for? I just realized this as I’m typing lol. 

Anyways, you hear about the power of different vibrations, or frequencies. These vibes actually create mathematical shapes. You see it in videos you watch of the sand in a metal bowl, and someone hits the bowl to make it vibrate. 

I hope I’m making sense with all of this. 

Okay, so look at major world happenings, or historical events with a lot of energy directed at them, in the form of our conscious attention. 9/11, titanic, any major shooting, etc. People in this sub start to notice weird coincidence and patterns, that leads them to believe it was done as some sort of “Illuminati ritual”, but what if the OPPOSITE is true? 

Think of a snowflake, in the crazy world of chaotic random nature, perfect patterns are being made naturally. What if you could visualize all of our lifetime decisions as an entire civilization, and it formed a similar mathematic pattern, and wasn’t random like we all thought it was. 

Smaller snowflakes, all coming together to make bigger snowflakes, all coming together to make bigger snowflakes, and so on and so on, in the form of energy, or vibrations. 

When a major event happens, it’s like a big energy snowflake, which is why you see so many odd coincidences, like a movie about the same thing happening years before, or a popular song who’s title is the name of someone who was killed, or how Kobe is covid in Hebrew or something like that, you know what I mean if you’re in this sub. 

Maybe these are NATURAL occurrences, and some people out there have caught on, and have sort of formed a cult around these mathematical occurrences that control all of our choices?

1417,Challenger Space Shuttle &amp; the Twilight Zone,"Idk if this is a conspiracy theory or a strange historical coincidence but I recently came across these twilight zone episodes from the 80s on YouTube; during one of their reboots that are never as good as the original even tho the Jordan Peele ones aren’t terrible. 

So I’m watching this episode last night called Quarantine where this guy wakes up 300 years in the future after being cryogenically frozen (reminds me of Woody Allen’s movie Sleeper, but this isn’t a pizzagate pedo conspiracy, tho I’m sure one of you will twist this post into that) and he’s like why did you wake me up and they are like there’s an asteroid coming towards earth, you designed these satellites before you were frozen we need you to use the satellites to blow up the asteroid before humanity goes extinct. So I hes like I thought the future would look more futuristic and there’s a weird scene where they are harvesting animals for energy (reminds me of the Matrix)but it is the future and they communicate with telepathy and so right before he signals the satellites to blow up the asteroid it starts decelerating and he’s like asteroids don’t move like that tell me the truth and they are like we used the telepathy to trick you into thinking it was an asteroid but it’s really a United States space shuttle carrying a thousand corrupt politicians. And then there is this bizarre scene where you see the space shuttle explode. Right so, that’s strange.(But what’s even stranger is they used actual footage of the challenger for another episode in that reboot). Right so check this, that episode aired Feb 7 1986. The Challenger Space Shuttle exploded January 28 1986!

That means they filmed the space shuttle exploding before the space shuttle exploded then aired the space shuttle exploding 10 days after the space shuttle exploded!

That’s some shady ass shit!

Was this a conspiracy back in the 80s? People watching the twilight zone must have been like what the hell is going on? Or is this just a bizarre historical coincidence?

1422,Odd correlation in pop culture...,"I played Cyberpunk 2077 to a point where you go into a digital world and encounter a wall that veils another reality. That wall, visually and conceptually, looks exactly like the wall used in Wandavision, denoting the same veil between realities. I can't see a correlation between CDPR and Disney from a business standpoint, and I find the visual for the unrelated projects unnerving. Cyberpunk also mirrors many aspects of Westworld S03, both featuring the concept that one can choose which high-tech crimes one wishes to commit in a virtual world without true consequences beyond virtual death. I know it's called ""programming"" but this is beyond heavyhanded. Again, I can't see a correlation between WB/HBO, Disney, and CDPR. This might be like a Marvel/DC comics thing where you're given the illusion of false choice (both feature superheroes that mirror their ""competition"" despite pushing the same ideologies, and both are owned by Disney and Time Warner respectively).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRU7otih7nk&amp;feature=emb_title

Kinda like when they stopped publishing radnet data.  If you don't know what that is, it is a system designed to monitor all radiation levels in the US, they used to publish their tests off all rainwater, ground water, milk and air samples across the country.  Guess when the stopped publishing that data?

Wonder what this means for the dollar?  Likely nothing good, hold on to your hats folks, my assessment is that this is the main story that the media is obfuscating with their constant pandemic story line.  

Moral of the story, if your holding lost of cash right now.  Well it may be a good time to diversify your positions.  Cash is not a great store of value, and I think you may have missed the boat to buy precious metals.  

A few next best things in my dumdum opinion.  

Guns and ammo tend to hold their value and are useful in hunting.  I would go with shotguns and rifles that you can use to hunt.  

Chest freezers and a pile of meat storage, perhaps other food items that you eat regularly, like 50lb bags of rice, noodles ect. 

Seeds of things you eat and other things you may want to trade for in the future.  I would tend to buy stuff from your local area that is organic and heirloom.  

Back up generator and fuel.

I suppose some crypto would be fine, though I am not a big fan of bitcoin, there are a few others that are decent and actually do something for society.  Don't ask me I have no clue what to tell you.

This is all I can think of off the top of my head but I wouldn't go crazy on purchasing things you will never use or have no use for.  The best investment really are tools or things you can use to add value and or create.  This will always be valuable no matter the currency we use.  

Take care, be well and I hope I am wrong here.  But the signs are pointing to the end of the dollar as the world reserve, before our very eyes while they distract us with covid, which I believe is the only reason this did not happen last year.",conspiracy

1482,"So we have this girl in Germany, which might have killed herself like Epstein..","Talking about Kasia Lenhardt. She is known for being on Heidi Klum’s Germanys next topmodel. She is also the ex girlfriend of Jérôme Boateng, a german football player. He is under contract with Roc Nation Sports (Jay-Z).


Now, I‘m not really deep into it, but here are the facts:

She was 25 and hang herself on the 6th Birthday of her son allegedly because of social media bullying. (Of course the media and other people of interest gratefully took this course to further promote social justice...)
Conspiracies started growing because of several friends, who started to speak out on social media. They presented for example voice messages of her, telling that Boateng and his new girlfriend were terrorizing and spying on her. She said her mobile phone was being monitored and they were threatening her with things she said in private. Additionally, her last Instagram posts were very cryptic and she was writing about not being able to escape.
As you might have suggested, according to her friends, she wanted to speak out on something. People are saying she knew too much...

Well the part that made me post here was this: yesterday, the most famous German forensic expert Michael Tsokos made a statement on Instagram suggesting that he did the autopsy and that there ist no doubt of anything else than suicide. He addressed it directly to the conspiracy pages. He also was obviously reading notes or a script. It’s a 3-min Video and he seemingly never read from notes before. 

People posted stuff about Boateng being a satanist because of the JayZ connection and his tattoos. Many even talk about a satanic ritual because it was the 6th birthday of her son... I don’t really buy this last part. 

But what I buy is that wealthy and well connected people can take that suicide service from the CIAs and Mossads of this world if they need to keep certain things in secret. Especially that Jay-Z type of wealth and connection.

I don’t think she’s kinda important or that Boateng is a member of the Illuminati. But it feels like this stuff happens in the US every day..

1483,What are the weird Drones over Orlando?,"http://imgur.com/gallery/72uaBE8

My brother &amp; I are avid star gazers &amp; we've been seeing some weird stuff this year. The one that's been really bugging are these weird drone things? 

The first one I saw was about 2 weeks ago &amp; it's in the video attached. I was on my porch and I saw what looked like an unnaturally bright light in the sky. It almost looked like a headlight because it was so bright. So I'm just standing there squinting at the thing for about 3 minutes and there was no noise or movement. All of the sudden it started moving towards me and the noise it was making was really loud (can't tell by the video audio unfortunately). It flew directly over me and then past the house. My fam said it was a drone but this thing was pretty huge so it had to be military grade or something. 

My sister and I saw another one a week later that went past out car &amp; over a lake. Weird thing is that this time it was in the middle of the day &amp; it was shaped like a plane but was the size of a small helicopter. It wasn't a plane though because it was moveing super slowly. 

Then tonight I go out and I see 3 more... one really high up above the house and two lower down, one to the left &amp; one to the right. They had the same weird light patterns &amp; the one flying furthest down was making the same noise I heard from the first. I've seen plenty of planes &amp; helicopters while stargazing &amp; obviously that's not what these are.

So if they are drones does anyone know what they are for? Military/police? It's driving me nuts lol",conspiracy

&gt;The general definition accepted by professionals is that gang-stalking is when a person believes they are being **stalked**, **followed**, **spied on**, and **attacked** by a **group of people** or **organisation**.

Season 4 and 5 made it clear that I was being watched. They left hints in the episodes that they knew my private conversations in my house, knew what wallpaper I use on my computer, knew my Internet history, my Google Drive files, private journals, etc. 

They also implied violent threats against me. For example, have a character do what I did or wrote about to then be violently murdered.

Anyway, there were other shows too that I talk about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/dsyivo/gangstalked_by_celebrities/).

I'm looking around for information to help dissuade or at least raise some questions for those that I know personally who are interested in getting the vaccine. Things such as evidence of side-effects, safety, etc.

If I can help inform a family or close friend about the whole situation going on without sounding like a crazy guy going on about conspiracies and stuff by showing proof, I'd like to be able to do that. Hence me trying to make a thread looking for a legitimate source of proof.

I've come across a few threads that directed me to look at the VAERS data and holy shit, there's a whole lot of these reported side-effects... which completely contradict the whole fucking saying ""There are no known side-effects"". Not that I believed that in the first place, because I'm sure for *every* drug and even traditional vaccines, there have been side-effects. And of course, they can always say that there are no known side-effects because we're still on a trial of testing on whoever volunteers, right?

These are the threads I've come across for anyone wondering.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lrok1l/covid\_vaccine\_deaths\_and\_injuries\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lrok1l/covid_vaccine_deaths_and_injuries_data/)

Anyways, I know there's gonna be that argument of ""The side-effects are very unlikely"", but when people mention something about not knowing the **long-term** side effects, the response they're giving is ""Well, we do know the effects of COVID"". Funny enough, when I did the simple math of COVID deaths/cases, a lot of it ends up being around 1%. So in other words, around a 99% survival rate. And this is the reasoning that they're giving us to go get the vaccine... as if the risks of the vaccine, including the no known long term effects will outweigh the risks of COVID, who many have seem to recovered from.

To know that not all of the adverse effects are reported either can only make one wonder exactly what the real count is. But to even just deny the possibilities of **any** side-effects, trying to convince us to take this, raising awareness for it... Why? If it's so safe, why are these companies not liable for anything that happens?

Thanks Judy. If you liked that one, you might also enjoy this Twitter feed I recently discovered. It’s called COVID One Year Ago, and if it weren’t so horrifying, it would be hysterical. https://bit.ly/2NXVRPO  

Check out these quotes and headlines from last February. They’re notable, not because they’re so wrong and so recent, but because they're so certain. 

February 5, 2020, Los Angeles Times: “How to prevent coronavirus: Wash your hands and ditch the mask.” https://lat.ms/3aSy7p7

February 9, 2020, New York City Health commissioner Dave Chokski: “Today our city is celebrating the LunarNewYear parade in Chinatown, a beautiful cultural tradition with a rich history in our city. I want to remind everyone to enjoy the parade and not change any plans due to misinformation spreading about coronavirus.” https://bit.ly/3suUVSa 

February 17, 2020, USA Today: “[Dr. Anthony] Fauci doesn’t want people to worry about coronavirus, the danger of which is ‘just minuscule.’ But he does want them to take precautions against the ‘influenza outbreak, which is having its second wave.’” https://bit.ly/3r8aIpL 

February 18, 2020, California Healthline: “In the Alhambra Unified School District, where about half of the students identify as Asian, administrators discourage the use of face masks and try to explain to families that they don’t protect from disease, said Toby Gilbert, a spokesperson for the district. That is sound scientific advice.” https://bit.ly/2O2dI88 

February 20, 2020, KERA, the north Texas NPR affiliate: “Experts Say Coronavirus Poses A Low Risk To The U.S. — So Why Are We So Afraid?” http://bit.ly/3bIYHAk 

On February 22, 2020, ABC News reported, “Health experts warn life-saving coronavirus vaccine still years away.” https://bit.ly/3qX2VL1 

Is it unreasonable for a casual observer to read through this hot mess and conclude that every one of these journalists, politicians, and scientists seemed more interested in fighting xenophobia than they were in protecting Americans from a potentially deadly virus? Is it unreasonable to wonder how many more Americans would have died as a result of these comments, had the virus turned out to be even deadlier than it is? 

Some will argue, “But Mike, that isn't fair. These people were just following the science. Science evolves, and when it does, reasonable people change their beliefs when new information is brought to light.” 

I couldn’t agree more. But ""following the science"" wherever it may lead demands a measure of modesty. A willingness to be completely and totally wrong. So I would ask these defenders of the mistaken, “Where is their humility?  Where are their apologies? Where is their embarrassment?  Why do so many people in the public eye work so hard to sound so certain every time they hold forth?” 

Obviously, the problem is not limited to COVID. Consider the claims driving the climate debate, and the certainty of those making them. I just watched John Kerry tell CBS, ""The scientists told us three years ago we had 12 years to avert the worst consequences of climate crisis. We are now three years gone, so we have nine years left."" He said a great deal more as well, and he spoke as he always does, with absolute conviction and deep certainty. http://bit.ly/2NxcL8g

So, John Kerry is certain, but is he right? Many believe he is not. Others believe he’s not only mistaken, but that he's deliberately trying to mislead and frighten Americans for all sorts of political reasons. Are these people unreasonable for being skeptical? Are they conspiracy nuts? Are they “climate change deniers?"" Or are they Americans who have grown wary of doomsayers who sound no less certain than Al Gore and so many others who have publicly attached a ticking clock to their endless predictions of certain doom?  

2008: Al Gore Predicts that Earth’s “Ice Caps” Will Melt away

2000: “Children Aren’t Going to Know What Snow Is in Five Years.” http://bit.ly/3aW8N1Q 

1987: “Within 15 years, the earth will be warmer 
than it has been in the past 100,000 years.” https://bit.ly/3kpZqdN 

1970: Earth Day Prof. Predicts A Super Ice Age Will Engulf The World. https://bit.ly/3aRdwSj 

1967: “Dire Famine by 1975.”  https://bit.ly/3uv5FS5 

Again, these predictions are notable not because they were all so wrong, or delivered by experts. There notable because they were all so unapologetically certain. And yet, we still fall for it, over and over, year after year. I know a lot of reasonably intelligent people who now believe the world will end in nine years if we don’t abandon fossil fuels immediately. It’s not just that they believe it – they know it. They know it to the point where they’ll shout down all those who disagree, or dismiss them as deniers, or demand they be forbidden from speaking.

I’m not pointing any of this out to pick a fight with hardcocre environmentalists. I'm just saying that nowadays, the harder people work to sound credible, the less persuasive they appear. But who knows? Maybe John Kerry is right? Maybe there is a “climate crisis,” and maybe it's all over in nine years. Personally, I think we’re going to make it to 2030 and beyond, but I don’t have a crystal ball, and I've been wrong before. On the other hand, I don’t need a crystal ball to see the crisis that is actually upon us. I refer to the credibility crisis unfolding as we speak. 

We don’t have to wait nine years to see what happens when our press, our leaders, and our scientific community lose the faith and trust of the American people. All we have to do is look around for those in the public eye who have the trust of those on both sides of the aisle. It’s a pretty short list, and while I don’t imagine myself to be on it, it is why I called my book ""The Way I Heard It,"" and not ""The Way It Was."" It’s also probably why W.B. Yeats, a far better writer than I, wrote this, at the end of his poem, The Second Coming. “The best lack all conviction, while the worst are filled with passionate intensity.” 

Of course, and to your point, Judy, Travis McGee said it even better, which is why his words appear in the front of my book.

I know most people think the term ""illegal aliens"" simply means they come from other countries, but the truth is... there is no telling where they actually come from.  There are no documents. It is the perfect cover... and for some reason the U.S. government welcomes them with open arms. Many State Universities only charge undocumented aliens the discounted state tuition... while charging proper U.S. citizens from out of stated 10-20 times more per semester. How does that make sense?

We have this place and others like it, a place where many opinions can generally be shared and people of opposing views can hash it out in a furious keyboard battle. 

There are so many places who already lost this  and some who have never experienced the remaining freedoms we have left. Be thankful for today and what we have. Embrace it, hope we don’t lose it, and remember it even when its gone.

1568,The painful truth,"We are seeing the most communistic measures enforced at all levels of government that we've ever seen in our lifetimes, and yet rather than being alarmed by the things going on, so many of you applaud.

People are being arrested for spending too much time outside, and you applaud. Pastors are being arrested for daring to hold church services, and you applaud. A child's birthday party is raided by police, and you applaud. A young woman is ticketed for going on a leisurely drive alone because it's deemed ""non-essential travel"", and you applaud. A parade of school teachers and administrators who wanted to drive through neighborhoods and wave at children is busted up by cops because they were ""nonessential,"" and you applaud. A lone paddleboarder in the ocean on a beach without any other people around is arrested because he's violating quarantine orders, and you applaud.

People are being denied life saving medical treatments because they're not a priority right now (not ""essential"" as deemed by the government) as the entirety of our medical system is focused on one thing, and you applaud.

Businesses are beings forcibly closed and padlocked and owners arrested for refusing to shut down, and you applaud. Dairy farmers (and soon, other farmers) are being incentivized to stop dairy farming and to sell their herds, and you don't seem to understand the implications.
You're being told to use hotlines and online forms provided by your local governments to report your neighbors who don't obey, and you comply.

You scold people day after day for not obeying government edicts, and if any of us dare to question what's happening, you lecture about how we're a danger to society and and we just don't care about people dying.

You've somehow managed to convince yourselves that the people whose lives are affected by a virus are MUCH more important than the people whose lives are being destroyed (and in many cases, leading to death) by the effects of a worldwide economic shutdown and impending worldwide depression the likes of which no one has ever seen before.  At what point will you start QUESTIONING what's going on?
How far does the government have to push before you're jolted awake from your slumber? How far are you willing to go with this?
If they told you to load your families onto train cars so that you could be taken to Virus Protection Facilities for your own safety, would you do it?
YES. Yes, you would.That much has become painfully obvious. Yet the whole time, you'd be shaking your finger and yelling at those who refused, accusing them of being ""a danger to society"" and ""not caring if people die.""  But they don't have to load you onto train cars and take you to Virus Protection Facilities, or force you to comply, because you do that voluntarily.
They control your mind. They control you through fear. They control you by convincing you that the world is a scary dangerous place, but they're here to protect you, care for you, and keep you safe, just as long as you OBEY.

They know that as long as you're locked inside your comfortable home with Netflix, Video games, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and a cell phone, while dangling a check in front of you like a carrot on a stick, you'll comply. No force is necessary for the majority of the herd.
The truth is YOU ARE IMPRISONED, willingly, and you're too blind to see it.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of months ago I was walking my dog and it was just after a snow storm so there was tons of snow on the ground. I noticed that there was a house that was never there before in the middle of a field near where I live. Curious I took a picture of the house and looked at it on my phone. Shrugging it off I walked back home with my dog and that was that. The house was still there and I thought nothing of it the following weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

But then today when I went to that same area to walk my dog I looked over where the structure was and there wasn’t anything there. Just a few cars parked where the driveway would be I assume. I found this very bizzarre and went home and tried to find the picture I took of the house. To my surprise the house was no where in my camera roll and there was just some green glitched out picture I will show below. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my neighbors and they had no recollection of a house ever being in that field. One of my neighbors only said that sometimes they go hunting in the woods by the field. Am I losing my mind? Or is something happening? I feel completely out of my mind posting this on here. Some clarity? 

&amp;#x200B;

[This is the photo that I took at the house](https://preview.redd.it/s8pnve78koj61.jpg?width=1932&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de83fdb8f4cd728edad9a597470aebb726fab81f)

Apparently these are real people, and I did some more research on this and it was claimed to be fake and was suppose to be some kind of joke/parody. I feel like this might actually be a real thing but they are saying it’s fake so that people don’t question it or investigate. 

I have a theory that this is in fact  real and might actually be some kind of trafficking operation, posing as a dating section, and it’s only accessible to a certain group of people such as the wealthy elites, all the people in the picture seemed to be adults and not kids, so this could also possibly just be some form of legalized prostitution, but this looks more like a trafficking situation to me. It wouldn’t surprise me at all if a big company like Amazon could pull off something like this, this also has some similarities to the way fair conspiracy.",conspiracy

1703,Who murdered the wealthy socialite Lara Prychodko?,"The death of **Lara Prychodko**, a wealthy Manhattan woman who died after plunging down her building’s trash chute in 2018 has long been ruled a bizarre accident.


But her dad has a different theory claiming in a wild new lawsuit that his daughter’s estranged husband **hired a hitman** to have her killed.


&gt;The Manhattan Supreme Court wrongful death suit filed Tuesday by Prychodko’s father, Nicholas Prychodko, and financial advisor **Lance Meyerowich** on behalf of her estate — offers no proof of the claim.


But it alleges that Prychodko’s estranged husband **David paid** paid someone to off his 48-year-old wife because he stood to lose as much as half of an approximately **$6 million fortune** upon the couple’s finalization of their contentious divorce.
No criminal charges have been filed against Schlachet in connection to the case.


&gt;Prychodko was found dead July 10 in the basement garbage room of her luxury **Union Square** building, less than a month after she celebrated her birthday in Paris with family and friends.


Cops at the time said she was last seen alive on surveillance video, in which she appeared to be drunk and stumbling about.


A maintenance worker discovered her body “crushed from multiple angles” in the compactor, police have said.


&gt;The city Medical Examiner ruled Prychodko’s death an accident in December that year.


But her family maintained it was no accident, and hired former New York City, chief medical examiner **Dr. Michael Baden**, who said he found that Prychodko may have been strangled to death.


&gt;Now their new suit alleges she was strangled by a hitman identified only as “John Doe,” and also named as a defendant in the court paper at the behest of Schlachet.


**The lawsuit alleges the husband and John Doe met in Manhattan several times in June 2018.**


&gt;*“Upon information and belief, during these meetings, Schlachet offered to pay John Doe to murder Lara Prychodko, ”* the suit claims, adding that John Doe accepted *“and agreed to murder”* her.


&gt;The suit charges that Schlachet was able to track Prychodko through the software he installed on her laptop, and in early July 2018, “John Doe” visited the **Zeckendorf Towers** and another nearby building where Prychodko kept an apartment.


The court documents posit that when Prychodko took the elevator up to the 27th floor on July 10, 2018, “John Doe strangled her to death and then disposed of her body down the building’s trash chute.”


&gt;Days later, the suit alleges that Schlachet met with *“John Doe” in Manhattan and “made a final payment to John Doe for the murder of Lara Prychodko.”*


Schlachet then attempted to **“cover-up”** the alleged slaying by planting a *""series in various news outlets to shift the focus away from himself as a suspect,”* the lawsuit alleges.


The lawsuit accuses Schlachet of being “financially motivated” to kill the mom of one, with who he was going through an “acrimonious divorce” at the time.
His construction firm, **Taocon Inc.**, filed for **bankruptcy** in 2016 while facing several lawsuits, it notes.


&gt;The lawsuit is seeking damages *“in an amount to be determined at trial”* and the disqualification of Schlachet as a beneficiary of Prychodko’s estate.
A lawyer for Nicholas Prychodko declined to comment to The Post on Wednesday.

**Schlachet did not immediately return a request for comment by The Post.**

1736,"Covid didn't magically wipe out just the flu. It battled measles, too. From January 1 to December 31, 2020, only 13 individual cases of measles were confirmed in the U.S.","[.](https://crossfitz.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/quixotic-tilt-at-the-windmills_0.gif?w=340&amp;zoom=2)

Measles cases in 2020

From January 1 to December 31, 2020, only 13 individual cases of measles were confirmed. 


https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html




Remember the vaccine programming going on during that time?  Science-illiterate robots were acting like everybody was going to die of measles.  Comedies and fictional television shows told us through Operation Mockingbird how dumb we were if we weren't getting every injection because measles was the boogeyman virus that could cause untold harms.

Then covid was released. This was what all the the measles nonsense was prepping the sheep for. 

1282 cases of measles were confirmed in 2019. 

That dropped to 13 in 2020.  Only one case for every 1,000 we had the year before.  The found the perfect boogeyman; didn't need measles any longer. 


Just a little more info about the ""outbreaks"" of measles, which tends to be blamed on  non-vaccinated individuals. 


&gt;The phenomenon of measles infection spread by MMR (live measles-mumps-rubella vaccine) has been known about for decades. In fact, 20 years ago, scientists working at the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases, funded by the WHO and the National Vaccine Program, discovered something truly disturbing about **the MMR vaccine: it leads to detectable measles infection in the vast majority of those who receive it.**

https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/vaccinated-spreading-measles-who-merck-cdc-documents-confirms


&gt;&gt;“During the measles outbreak in California in 2015, a large number of suspected cases occurred in recent vaccines. **Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences.**”

&gt;In other words, about 38 percent of suspected measles cases in the 2015 Disneyland measles scare in California were actually vaccine-related and not caused by transmission of wild-type measles.

https://www.wakingtimes.com/portions-of-measles-outbreaks-are-due-to-vaccine-reactions-and-not-wild-measles-virus/


&gt;Both the nasopharyngeal and urine samples tested positive for measles virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which targets the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes of the virus.1 Differentiation between the wild-type and vaccine strains was performed by an in-house assay. The results were available postadmission day two and showed that it was a vaccine strain of measles virus. Subsequently, the sample was sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory of Canada, which established that the virus belonged to genotype A, **confirming it to be a vaccine strain**.

However, considering the mortality rate, the age of people most likely to be infected, the rate at which younger people actually die, let alone get sick, etc it's obvious, to me at least, that the restrictions and lockdowns don't make any sense. A lot of this stuff doesn't really make sense.

When you mix in all these death numbers that are being lumped in with COVID, a lot of which aren't even *closely* related (e.g. gun shot victim = COVID death), all the false information and inside work that's been done with this (plenty of very knowledgeable people have claimed the virus was manufacturer, and with good reason)...there's just so much FUD around all of it.

1788,The conspiracy now,"Its becoming more and more difficult to relay information without getting ""canceled"" or... Banned.. for no good reason.

I'm talking about human rights abuses by the powers that be. All this propaganda that's flooding the top of pages, and then ""they"" will ignore, cancel or censor you if you post factual information that upsets their narrative. Trying to expose the truly violent nature of the US governments goals of conquest, is pushed out off to the side. There is a big scam going on right now. They're trying to pull the wool over everyone's eyes and it's pretty freaky how they are going about it. 

I am by no means for trump, but I am not exactly against him either. I think he was on to something perhaps. The all out media campaign sought to destroy him from day one, they turned all of social media against him. BUT, Unforgivable under his administration, the atrocities in Yemen. He didn't do anything to help. The atrocities that now Biden and the mainstream propaganda have yet to even address. As the innocent people of Yemen still face a massive crises, families, children are dying, starving. Infrastructure destroyed by the Saudi Arabian bombing campaign. Hospitals, schools. Gone. With the help of the US government.

Not only has social media been turned against trump, all these people who think biden is the answer, claim to be on board for human rights. Then they turn a blind eye to Timber Sycamore, the CIA operation to arm terrorists in Syria to fight the Assad and the Russians. Carried out under the Obama Administration. This makes biden a complicit war criminal. Where the hecks the press on that huh? Blocked. Banned. Canceled. That's where.

Operation Cyclone directly Parallels Timber Sycamore.

All of the mainstream media and social platforms have been penetrated by... Lol.. ""federal tentacles."" They have their eyes everywhere seems like. Making sure the balance is kept of mindless trump hate, racism division, and disregard for human life. As long as those tabloids keep running, the money keeps rolling in, and the people stay hypnotized into thinking that the democrats or republicans are pulling off some huge humanitarian effort... WAR looms.

The whole Q-anon debacle created a turning point, gave a reason that allowed the big tech and media to silence and dismantle elements of free speech on the internet. I'm not justifying them, but the actions carried out by few have affected a massive amount of people, of us.
At first I didn't think they would get this far, I ignored that our free speech could be confiscated so easily. Now it's here though. Its happening. Unnerving.",conspiracy

1791,"Could the potential future legalisation of micro-dosing psychedelics (LSD), be used similarly to Aldous Huxley’s soma?","Bit of a shitpost I know.. and it’s not a perfect resemblance, with the only real connection being it’s a hallucinogen, but I can see that if micro dosing became legal in an interesting regulated way, it could potentially serve a similar purpose of keeping us more content/docile within a stricter totalitarian society. 

When giving it real thought, LSD actually breaks down the social constructs and norms we’ve been indoctrinated with since birth. So much can be said about it, however this isn’t a promotion for such things so I won’t drag on. 
If you know you know.

One thing I can’t shake though, is the prominent part LSD played in MK Ultra. Long story short they used abuse/torture and drugs to create split personalities/alter egos. It increased the influence over them and thus, achieving some sort of mind control. 

The question in mind: Could the use of propaganda within an ever increasing dystopian society.. alongside micro-dosing LSD, create more of a delusional, but content state of consciousness among the masses that’s even easier to control? 

Raises another question: Is the current use of anti-depressants the reason why so many people don’t seem to care about what’s going on around them? 

It’s one of the most powerful/mind altering drugs.. the main reason it’s illegal as it completely shatters what you thought you knew.  But theres still a lot of negative stigma attached to it for a majority of people (and mainly the ones most brainwashed). If the government flipped their stance completely and pushed it in form with therapy, people may just start liking their slavery even more.

My problem is with bitcoin. 

Bitcoin has turned into a cult and a grand ponzi scheme. Once you join this cult, you need to call other crypto coins shitcoins. Now some of these crypto coins are obviously superior to bitcoin because they provide some inherent features like anonymity. Then why call them shitcoins? To me bitcoin is shitcoin. It is overly inflated. It is unusable. It doesn't provide anonymity. It is useless in every aspect. But for some reason, this cult got really big and is about to turn into a fully fledged religion. ""You have to believe in Bitcoin! It is the future! It is a way to break out of the system!"" 

Sorry but I am not buying it. 

Where is the conspiracy part? Whales and the mindless cult members. They know that bitcoin is like any other crypto currency but they make it sound like it is vastly different and even better than other currencies when in reality it's not.  They are manipulating your perception of this particular coin. They want you to think it's the best one out there.

A Danish newspaper just broke a story about how the health authorities have been inflating the number of people in hospital due to Covid.

I'll do a quick translation of what the health authorities have said:

""This is because all patients who have been admitted to Danish hospitals have been routinely tested for coronavirus.""

""Patients who have been hospitalized after a traffic accident or because they were about to give birth have therefore been included in the statistics if they were tested positive for coronavirus.""

""**Thus, patients who had no symptoms and therefore did not require treatment were included in the inventory of coronavirus inpatients. Thus, they have also not been admitted to the wards reserved for corona patients. And they have therefore not occupied beds either and pushed the capacity.**""

I'm not saying Covid is not real, people in my family have been sick, but I wish we could have a more rational debate about how to handle this virus.

However, the timeline is uncanny. Trump was accused of a stolen election and basically we have the most controversial election in history. Trump was accused of links to Russia, we know Biden has links to China. We know about all the corruption in Ukraine from Biden and his family. We know Trump is a perv, maybe ties to children, we have footage of Biden openly engaging inappropriate behavior with children, and his son. Trump is accused of racism, we know Biden’s record has not been good on this issue. We know Biden has real corruption.

No. Thanks.,"[Previous Post Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lj8fi8/flatten_the_curve_part_89_sentient_world/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

Flatten the Curve. Words matter. Always have, always will. Confession time. Back when they first introduced the term Flatten the Curve I thought they meant the population curve only. And I still think that's part of it. Not a population reduction per se, just flattening the growth curve. Now that doesn't mean that certain demographics aren't being affected more severely than others, they are, and whether or not this is by design or not can be debated (but it certainly does look like an attempt to prepare for upcoming events, doesn't it) but we won't able to discern the truth until later.     

Let's face facts; at this point the response by those in charge don't measure up to the real world data. So something else is going on, obviously. This could be an attempt to restructure society to face upcoming environmental disasters. This could also be an attempt at exerting more control over society by the one percent. Or it could be both. And it probably is. But it probably should also include something else.    


#AI       



Why do I say that? A few reasons. One, as readers of this series already know, there is a worldwide organization that calls itself AIWorldGovernment. Or some such nonsense like that. This isn't a rinky dink operation. All the big players are involved. Military. Tech. Universities. Health organizations. Do you think that society is ready to give up control to an AI yet? I don't. But we might be after we lose faith in our politicians to do their jobs, right? Just something to keep in mind as we move forward.    

Two, they may think they need AI to deal with the upcoming environmental problems. And it's looking more and more likely that we're about to face those problems head on • I'll have more details in an upcoming post.    


Three, China and the Five Eyes both want to create AI first to control the planet. Why do you think Putin states that the country that invents AI will rule the planet? Becasue it's true, and every little event as we go forward has to be looked at through this perspective.    


So what else could Flatten the Curve mean?     


Flatten the Learning Curve. What learning curve? The Learning Curve of AI.     


Yep. There I said it. Look. Simulations have to tested against real world results to be verified and learned from. Riots. Check. Pandemic. Check. Manipulate online behavior to ensure compliance. Check. Some aren't complying? Update models and test against new simulations.

And I'm sure that it's just a big coincidence that the office for Total Information Awareness has a pyramid with the all seeing eye casting a light on the planet isn't nefarious at all. Nope. Nothing to see hear folks. Nothing. At. All.     


And if that wasn't bad enough, then the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office) got in on the comic book villan act by using a giant octopus as it's logo with these words as it's motto:

Does that not concern you? At all? Because it concerns me. A great deal. Especially now that we are beginning to see more integrations of troops inside North America. Why? Oh that's right, domestic terrorism. That we're told exists. The proof? Trust us. That's it. Trust us. Ok. Sorry if I don't take the government at its word. Because, you know, two weeks to flatten the curve.      


So whats the big deal if the government is running simulations and inserting the military into North America?        



Actually it's a very big deal.  (Next segments are all sourced under the BBC link)



**A recent Darpa program seeks to use cutting-edge neuroscience to develop ""narratives"" that would influence the thinking a foreign audience.**       


Neuroscience to develop narratives? Really? Cool. What kind of narratives I wonder? Would they be the kind of narratives that set up riots claiming that we have potential domestic terrorism threats? Those kinds of narratives?     


###Secret NSA “Q” group sets out to distance Gov’t from involvement in 9/11


**2009** Wayne Madsen alleges that the NSA has set up the “Q” group,” a special secretive security **counterintelligence agency** “targeting journalists and prosecuting whistleblowing security officials,” its mission, “to distance Washington from any involvement in the 9/11 terrorists attacks.” He claims that he has seen documentation on “First Fruits,” an NSA database that keeps track of surveillance of journalists and their connections.
[Source Here](https://amadon606.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/secret-nsa-q-group-to-distance-govt-from-involvement-in911/)  


But hey, trust the plan, right? Funny how I never read what the plan was. Yes Q went on and on about deep state and patriots and underground bunkers filled with children, but did he actually share what the top super secret plan ever was publicly? With people who don't have one iota of military training other than playing Call of Duty? If that. Because I've never served, but I'll guarantee that you never ever give advance warning of an upcoming plan that is supposed to overthrow a deepstate cabal that has firmly resisted all attempts to overthrow it.       


So if the plan was to get an excuse to have armed soldiers at the Capitol and then label a domestic terrorism threat, well I guess the plan worked.      


In previous posts I've talked about the Sentient World Simulation and how the military wants to have an avatar for every single person on the planet, so they can run simulations to predict how we'll behave. Now we have sources that Darpa wanted to develop narratives to influence foreign societies (hey, don't we accuse Russia of doing the same thing?) And then we see that the NSA has a clandestine service called the Q group. Really? So, couldn't it be conceivable that Q was shaping an online narrative based off the results of simulations? I'd say yes, and the barb wire fence and troops at the Capitol lend more credibility to the theory. And if the troops and fence leave before the end of the year? Good. Great. But it still doesn't change the fact that I think normal citizens were manipulated into getting those measures done in the first place.    


Yet the sci fi crazy doesn't stop there. Nope. Not at all. And know what? I'd get used to it going forward. Why? Because our brains haven't caught up to the technology, that's why. 


##Mind control moves into battle. [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20120704-mind-control-moves-into-battle)        


&gt;But a device known as an electroencephalogram (EEG) can spot that P300 signal. Hooked into a sophisticated computer that can interpret the signal, it can immediately alert a person to a potential threat, taking a short cut through the brain’s normal conscious processing. Combined with advanced optics, it is possible to imagine a Terminator-like vision system that scans an area and immediately identifies and categorises threats.      
Although it sounds far-fetched, this is roughly the idea behind a new military technology called **Sentinel** (SystEm for Notification of Threats Inspired by Neurally Enabled Learning), which is being touted as the world’s first “cognitive-neural” binocular threat-warning system.        


Hey no problem, right? Let's just trust that the system gets the threat identification correct. Because there's no way that a computer could ever get something wrong, right?

###DARPA and the Brain Initiative

**The White House announced the BRAIN initiative in April 2013. Today, the initiative is supported by several federal agencies as well as dozens of technology firms, academic institutions, scientists and other key contributors to the field of neuroscience. DARPA is supporting the BRAIN initiative through a number of programs, continuing a legacy of DARPA investment in neurotechnology that extends back to the 1970s.** [Source Here](https://www.darpa.mil/program/our-research/darpa-and-the-brain-initiative)    


Did you notice that the neurotechnology extends back to 1970? Society didn't even have Pac Man or Donkey Kong back then. But you might be thinking hey, neurotechnology can do a lot of good. It can help people walk. It can help them see. Hear. And on and on. And you're right. And yet, where does it stop? Seriously. Because I'm having a hard enough time trusting them with a vaccine, let alone putting a chip in my brain. And yet, this is how it will be rolled out. Slowly. Softly. Look at all the good neurotechnology is doing for humanity. Why wouldn't you get a chip? 

Why. Wouldn’t. I. Get. A. Chip?    

MKUltra. 9-11 Anthrax. Prsim. Operation Sea Spray. Operation Big Itch. Project 112. Green Run. Operation Plumbbob. Project Sunshine. Operation LAC. Operation Tophat. Project CHATTER. Project BLUEBIRD. Tuskegee Syphilis Experiments. SHAD.     


That's a small list. I don't think that I need to go on. Because if they were cutting edge experiments back in the day designed to explore chemicals, radiation, and germ effects on the human body, guess what is considered cutting edge now? Can you say, microchips in the brain Boys and Girls?     


But we're too civilized now. That was back then. Yep. And back then had a back then too. Trust me. They said the same thing as society does now. No way. That was a long time ago. We're not barbarians now. Ok. Sure. Whatever they say. But I'll tell you one thing, I definitely won't be first in line. 


#Bottom Line     


Look. They've opened pandoras box. And it's not good. At all. Why has so much of this been out of view and quietly done, if not top secret and need to know. Really. Isn’t this supposed to be for the good of all humankind? Or have we been worried that another culture would learn to mind control it's soldiers first? Or learn to manipulate society better? Because if AI is so advanced and great, what would it matter who made it? Wouldn't it learn right from wrong on it's own? And wouldn't AI's right and wrong align with ours? Isn't that what they insist would happen? Becasue if you're lying about that, then why should we trust the government about AI + getting a chip?       


Or even Elon Musk? And he really seems to be eager to save humanity from AI by merging us with AI.

So Musk is against AI and we should embrace him. Yep. Sure thing. Absolutely. And we can trust him. Why? Because Joe Rogan loves him and they smoke pot together. That's why. At least that's what they want you to believe. Me? I don't believe it for a second.    

Next post I'm going all in and Elon is the main event. Not surface Elon. Not even the kind of information that you're going to expect to see. Trust me. Ninety nine percent of it is one hundred percent fact based information that anyone could find, but for the most part is just not talked about. And that should have been enough. But then something else caught my eye. Something strange. Actually no, not even strange. It's downright bizarre. And it's admittedly based on the most frivolous of connections. But it just seems to make sense. And if it turns out to be right, and that's a big **IF**, then our future is going to be filled with stranger things than we can imagine.

The only reason the rich and the wealthy are demonized is because of resentment and envy. Most people are talentless bigots who can't and won't take responsibility, and the ruling classes know this.

I feel that everybody railing against the elites are actually bluepilled, and fail to realize that numerical superiority doesn't actually translate into moral superiority. Look at the culture and behavior of the rich vs the poor. Just lol at thinking the world would be a better place if the barbarians at the bottom inherited the planet.

Fact is, if you still think you are actually fighting the good fight by trying to fight on the behalf of the masses, then you are still bluepilled.

Genetic studies have shown that on average, children born into the  higher classes have an IQ between 110-160, where as for the poor its  80-100. Not only that, but being poor is also positively correlated with  being ugly.*

*The rich and poor are  literally different sub-species of humans. It makes exactly zero  difference if the rich are ""born into it"". That's like saying there is  no inherent advantage to being born tall, because you don't ""earn being  tall"". It´s all bullshit cope. Genetic determinism rules.

There is a family that is so much bigger than you, yet it's a part of you, if you want to be adopted.

This is the family of love, the family of the one, true God. It's available here. It's available now.

The suffering that's here is here for a reason and it's there so that we can suffer through it in order to get somewhere. That somewhere is across the border, into the promised land.

It's hard because we liked where we were before. It was comfortable. But now we're out in the desert, following Moses, following the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.

The Living God, through whom all good things come.

We were in Egypt, and we were brought out of Egypt, strangers in a strange land. We were disobedient to later become obedient through the One who was totally obedient...

Moses (the Torah) cannot get you across the Jordan into the promised land. Moses died never having reached it. He could not be fully obedient to God. This happened so that we could know that the attempted goodness of humankind cannot match the goodness of God.

The name of Moses' successor: Yehoshua. Joshua. The son of Nun. Sometimes transliterated into the Greek: Iesous.

It's all there in the Torah: God's plan of redemption through one who was to come after Moses: the succession from the Mosaic Law to the Messiah, under whose kingdom will be brought (and is being brought) the kingdom of God.

God loved us all so much, even in our separation from Him, that he sent his son, Jesus, to be the goodness of God for us.

He walked as a light, a friend to messed up people, dirty people. He walked around with us as the love of God. He saw straight through the pretense and front of the ruling ""religious"" people of the day.

The people who had him killed, because they could not bear to lose their position. In the old days it was no king but God. Now: ""We have no king but Caesar!""

I bet some of them knew who it was they were killing. They wanted the inheritance for themselves, as the parable goes.

But what they didn't expect was for Jesus to get back up a couple days after, keeping the movement of love alive.

He demonstrated God's love for us in his actions, and now it's our turn so he can live in us.

God is love.

Fear no man. If God is with us, who can be against us?

Let's do our best to walk in love and confidence that, if we look for Him, we will find Him, and we'll be with him.

This has been barely reported in the MSM and, when it is, it’s mainly left at the relatively innocuous stinky mouth/ halitosis stage.  The Daily Mail takes it one stage further though:

[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8604639/Dentists-says-mask-wearing-causing-tooth-decay-gum-disease.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8604639/Dentists-says-mask-wearing-causing-tooth-decay-gum-disease.html)

As always, a little truth seeps in amidst the mass of lies, contradictions and conjecture. While quoting dentists, concerned about these recent developments, DM cannot help dismissing these concerns by quoting doctors simply dismissing them or by attacking other “conspiracy theories” attached to the mask issue.

This post posited a possible connection between gum disease and heart disease, pneumonia and plenty of other bacterial and fungal infections. I thought that a causal connection between gum disease and heart disease/ strokes had yet to be established. Until I found this:

“**Experiments by researchers in the Faculty of Dentistry at the University of Toronto, Canada, have revealed that gum disease primes blood cells called neutrophils, which then overreact to infection elsewhere in the body.**

The neutrophils, which are part of the body’s innate immune defenses, release signaling molecules called cytokines that exacerbate inflammation.

“It’s almost as if these white blood cells are in second gear when they should be in first,” says the study’s senior author, Prof. Michael Glogauer. “The \[neutrophils\] are much more likely to release cytokines much more quickly, leading to negative outcomes.”

The results appear in the [*Journal of Dental Research*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022034520963710).

**“Abstract: The presence of periodontal diseases (PDs) often strongly correlates with other severe chronic inflammatory conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and arthritis.**

**Thus, systemic factors associated with PD produce hyperinflammatory PMN \[polymorphonuclear neutrophils\] responses during a secondary infection**. To analyze this systemic effect in humans, we induced gingival inflammation in volunteers and also found significantly increased activation of blood PMNs in response to ex vivo stimulation, which reverted to normal following resolution of gingivitis. 

**Together, these results demonstrate that periodontal tissue inflammation has systemic effects that predispose toward an exacerbated innate immune response**. This indicates that peripheral PMNs can respond synergistically to simultaneous and remote inflammatory triggers and therefore contribute to the interaction between PD and other inflammatory conditions.”

1,What is fundamentally different with Q followers and us?,"I know it’s been discussed that QAnons may have a different brain make up or that they lack empathy. I keep trying to figure out how people I was so close with fell down the Q path. A few years back, my husband was VP of our association’s board of directors. We caught the president stealing around $400K of our associations money. After we confronted him, he launched a campaign against us basically screaming FAKE NEWS. We had hard core proof. The homeowners took sides and the community was divided. Neither side could be convinced otherwise. We had a large group of people who looked at the evidence and fought along side of us until the bitter end. The other side would not even look at the evidence. After several court battles, we won. The other side still believes we were evil people who just didn’t like the HOA president. There were 6 people who really fought with us. I thought they were just like me in terms of justice, being objective, etc. Flash forward to today. EVERY single one of them is a QAnon. They all believe the dems are pedophiles, Antifa is responsible for Jan 6, etc etc. 

So, my question is...how is it possible that ALL 6 of them fell down the Q hole? How could we have so many of the same qualities but be so different now? It has made me question if I was wrong. Even more mind boggling is the 3 people that we were against, and who stole the money, are liberals who think like I do!!  It’s nothing short of a mind fuck. It keeps me up at night. These people fought along side of me and now they fight along with Q. Can anyone shed light on this? Any ideas what went wrong or how I managed to escape Q?",QAnonCasualties

I also see a lot of things that are often listed as criteria in the DSM-V, like having the behavior affect your job or relationships. 

Will this ever be classed as a mental health disorder?",QAnonCasualties
3,Qanon took one of the brightest friends I ever knew.,"This doesn't really affect me a lot directly, but it still hurts. I posted about a former friend of mine on the wall on this Subreddit the other day, but I wanted to devote a post to this as well after having 24 hours to think about it.

I majored in political science in college and I graduated in the Spring of 2016, right before Trump won. Thankfully I was spared the fallout of his victory in college and got a job at a small office where, for the most part, everybody understood that it wasn't appropriate to discuss politics at work. I'm thankful that even after moving between a few different offices, the different workplaces I've been at have been relatively hush-hush as far as talking about politics goes.

When I as in college, I knew a guy who was 4 or 5 years older than me. He was a very sharp dude, he was an Army veteran and we shared the same major. Most of us senior PoliSci students planned to go to law school, including him.

At one point, we even agreed about a lot of things, and we could discuss what we disagreed about in a civil way. We always saw eye-to-eye on social issues, we differed in philosophy in some areas, sure, and he was always more conservative than me, but he supported Libertarian ideas and he always made a big deal out of letting his classroom know that he didn't want the government involved in everyday peoples' lives. He was a gifted speaker, debater, and he was overall extraordinarily skilled academically.

During his final semester in college, he ran for County Commissioner instead of going to law school, in the very county we went to college in. And he won handily because he was a young face with fresh ideas that had bipartisan support. He had overwhelming support from pretty much everybody in our area, not that it means a ton in the HEAVILY red state that I live in. He ran as a Republican but I had hope since he always described himself as a left-leaning Libertarian.

I don't live in the county he won in, but as far as I know, he never did anything revolutionary or controversial. But he did fall down the Qanon rabbit hole a few years ago. When we were in college he told me that he thought Trump was an absolute joke, and he gradually started believing that Trump never got a fair chance, then he fell deeper. He started listening to the rhetoric, believing it even. He became very combative almost overnight, challenging anything that didn't fit a right-wing narrative. He insulted me, after YEARS of friendship, when I made a pro-Net-Neutrality post. It was very shocking since a few years ago I know he'd have agreed with me.

I spend a while ignoring him and shaking off his ramblings as something he'd eventually get over, but once Biden won I wanted to see what he was thinking. After an extended break from his social media feed, I checked his FaceBook feed (we were still friends at the time) and he'd evolved into a total nutjob. He posted, sometimes mere hours and minutes apart, pro-Trump propaganda, WILD comment threads about how the election was stolen, he was FUMING over censorship, said wild things like ""if I disappear soon, it wasn't me, it was the feds,"" crazy shit like that. He wound up extremely paranoid. He posted tons of Q crap, said he was done with FaceBook, Twitter, etc. and urged everyone to follow him on Parler (as long lived as that platform was) and just became a different person than the bright dude I was friends with at one point. I think the final straw for me was him buying into the narrative that the COVID19 pandemic was a hoax, he even went as far as protesting against masks, vaccines and 5G towers.

I reiterate...this guy went from saying ""I think Trump is a joke but I still hold firm to my left-wing, Libertarian ideology"" to ""Trump and the right wing is being censored, the election was stolen, I fear for my life as an elected official.""

I haven't checked in on him since the 2020 election. The last thing I know about him is that he gained a ton of weight, his girlfriend who he bought his house with left him, and I suspect that he began drinking heavily.

This sucks. I'm glad nobody in my family or my small but close friend group ever fell into this, but I am very disheartened seeing such a gifted young guy, who I once worked with in college, who challenged me to think and study harder, stoop this low. He had such a wonderful potential career as a public servant. It hurts even more, after my own father, a fellow Army veteran and 30 years this guy's senior, tell me after the Capitol riots: ""I'm ashamed of my party, I didn't fight for this, I didn't see people die for this, and I'm sick of people following Trump off a cliff.""",QAnonCasualties

He is absolutely obsessed and it is all consuming for him.   When I joked tonight that he’s going to be bored when he has to stop watching and reading that stuff, he goes “I’m not deleting telegram, I just won’t talk about it with you”.  This was a shock to me because that was not the agreement.  And I’ve asked him multiple times to not bring it into every aspect of our lives and let us have normal conversations, yet he still does.  This lead to a very intense argument and he told me that “ I’m on the bad side and I’m in the hate cult”.   I don’t even know what to do.   I feel he is too far gone, and he is choosing the conspiracy over our marriage.   He is normally a loving husband, but he has changed so severely in the last few months and doesn’t recognize it.

6,Growing up beside a Q fanatic,"Now don't get me wrong, I love my mom. That woman gets my respect like no one else. However it has been a struggle to get raised by a Qanon mom. Imagine as a kid you come home and tell your mom some random science/school fact and not even have her look or listen to you because 'science is fake' and if you correct her, or try to, she'll get defensive and we all know how arguments go. Or if I even try to put my opinion out there she shuts it down and again, gets all defensive.
She firmly believes that reality is a simulation like the matrix and time travel, space wars, big pharma, Biden is a clone and a whole other thing. (I'm not linking the YouTube channel she watches cause anonymity issues) You get the idea though . So I was raised to try and question everything and not believe anything I was told. Yet she wants me to be a doll essentially by not questioning HER, just everything else. I mean I can talk to her normally but she is adamant about HER beliefs so it's like trying to break a rock with an egg. It was a struggle until I learned to mostly let go and stop quipping back or even caring about it once it tries to start up again. Thank you for reading my first post.

9,"This pandemic is ruining my mother, and I feel like I'm going crazy.","Hoo boy, where do I begin?

Well for starters, I'm new to this sub, and I want to make it clear that I'm **not** here to rag on my mom. I love my mom to death. She's the kindest most charismatic, friendly, and outgoing person I know, and she goes out of her way to support those in need, even if she gets screwed over in the end. None of this has changed, mind you, but she's been in a downward spiral in her beliefs ever since the pandemic started.

My mom has never been too fond of the economic left, but for the most part retained a mid to mid-right stance. She's a devout non-denominational Christian (not Catholic), and makes about 6 figures from her own recruiting business of which she has employees whom she treats very well.

Now I should say this Q-mindset started coming to light around the last couple years of Trump's presidency - when she learned about Spygate (She had read the book by Dan Bongino). However, the proverbial shit hit the fan about a month into the pandemic. I had been in college during the entirety of Trump's presidency, and the pandemic started during my final semester. Since I was in school, the only real interaction I've had with my mom was either on the holidays, occasional visits, or over the phone. During those infrequent interactions I noticed her talking more and more about this stuff. Things like ""The Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign"", or ""Vaccines are actually a problem"", or ""The COVID-19 had to be manufactured"", and so on. It was a little bothersome, but she was still open-minded and didn't dismiss any counterpoints I made, so I figured it wasn't too bad.

When I finally graduated in May 2020, I moved back home with my mom, her boyfriend, and my sister. After living back at home for the first extended period of time in a few years, it became apparent how deep into this she was. Here's a list of what she frequently talks about:

* The Great Reset - I know it's a real thing, but she fears the worst from it, i.e. ""You will own nothing, and you will be happy.""
* Bill Gates - eugenics, decreasing the population, and vaccines
* Globalism/NWO - George Soros, the Rockefellers, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwabb, etc.
* Vaccines - cause autism, do more harm than good
* COVID-19 - manufactured in a lab, the big crisis that the elites needed to initiate the NWO, vaccine will actually cause 100% mortality rate if a vaccinated person does become infected
* Biden - Puppet for the globalists
* Revelations - all of what is currently happening in the world is described in the book of Revelations, and the end of the world is coming soon.
* Evolution/Climate change - wrong and unproven
* Left-wing/Democrats - evil extremists
* Right-wing/Republicans - righteous, seek only to preserve the constitution

I studied mathematics and computer science in college, and I have been very passionate about the sciences all my life, so I know how to defend myself in that regard. When it comes to politics however, I am very out of the loop and don't know much, so I can't make any counterpoints. Not like any of that matters though.

Whenever I provide any data or credible sources, she always discredits me by saying that because the CDC/WHO/Big Pharma/NOAA/NIH/so-and-so University/etc. are funded by some globalist elite/democrat, it can't be trusted and it's all probably falsified data. She's so thick-headed and stubborn now, that even when I throw her logic back at her when she provides a source, she finds some way to still justify it in her mind. There's always some article, some whistleblower, some doctor, some economist, etc. that has the ""truth"", a.k.a. the information that aligns with her predisposition.

Granted that even though I know she constantly thinks about all of this, she thankfully doesn't always talk about it. She has two modes: Mom mode and what I like to call QMom mode. QMom only really manifests by some Q-related trigger; whether it be an article she found, a video, or whenever Biden does some stupid shit.

I've been having constant anxiety from all of this. Mainly because I'm the outlier in the house. Her boyfriend always backs her up (he's actually a very nice guy, but c'mon), and my autistic sister is always going to agree with her and parrot what she says. So in my house, I'm the crazy one. I'm starting to feel like I'm going crazy as well; to the point that some of her sources are becoming more and more compelling. I seclude myself from the rest of the family because of this, and so I can avoid the possibility of QMom appearing.

I feel bad though because she's genuinely scared. She's not this way because of an inferiority complex, or fulfilling a need to feel important, or using it as a way to ""be apart of something greater"". She's very scared for her family. She has constant anxiety, and she cries all the time. Her heart is in the right place.

All of this truly breaks my heart because we've always had a great relationship due to our like-mindedness and support for each other. I feel like we are getting more distant now, and I am scared to death that this will get worse, and that I'll lose my mom completely until all that's left is QMom. It also hurts a lot to see her cry all the time.

After briefly looking at some of the other stories on here, I could see how you might think that my situation doesn't seem all that bad, and I can't disagree with you. This is all something I never thought I would have to deal with, and for me, it's very upsetting. I just felt the need to get this all out of my brain.

Now that I'm at the bottom of this, I just realized I wrote a lot. Sorry about that. If you do take the time to read this, I appreciate it. And to any other affected individuals on here, I wish you the best.",QAnonCasualties

So my q husband believes all the qanon stuff (obviously). He thinks the epoch times is a legit news source and that we have to look out for Chinese spies and that there are Chinese spies in our government(we're Canadian). He's antivaxx and although he reluctantly agreed to get our children immunized, he causes a real fuss about it and is strongly against the covid vaccine(got really mad when his mother and I were talking about getting it). It seems all we have in common is our children and our shared years together (5 married). But I truly wish I could unchain myself from all this craziness and just talk to someone normal.

17,My mom is harassing my 92 year old grandmother,"Hey folks, first time posting on here. Little background information, I live in New York state with my wife and kids. My parents live in Wisconsin, which is where I grew up. We try to FaceTime with them every night so that they can read a story to our kids. A couple months ago we noticed my parents seemed different. They didn't seem excited to talk to the kids, they just seemed sorta blah. Then, finally, back in January, the floodgates opened. One day my mom started sending me all kinds of links and pictures from ""research"" she had done online. I didn't realize it at the time but everything she was sending me was Q related. At first I was polite and just tried to brush it off, telling her I did not want to discuss politics or hear about any of this stuff she was saying. Eventually she started getting more confrontational, telling me that I was oppressing her and her beliefs. She began insulting me, telling me that I can't really backup my beliefs and that I was blinded and close-minded. Finally, I exploded into an anti-Trump diatribe. She shot her fake research and delusions back at me, I told her these aren't political beliefs, they are a mass delusion and a cult. She wouldn't stop talking so I hung up on her. I realize I didn't handle it the best way, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I reached out to my aunt who is closest to my mom and found out that my mom hasn't talked to her in weeks over my aunt saying something bad about Trump on social media. Fast forward, my mom has mentioned that she is upset at my grandma for getting the Covid vaccine because she thinks it's going to kill her (another Q delusion.) We called my grandma last night to talk to the kids, and she mentioned that she wanted to speak to me in private. She had tears in her eyes and seemed upset about something. I called my grandma today and found out that my mother has been berating her about everything Q related. My grandmother keeps telling her that she doesn't believe in this and it upsets her to hear about it but my mother won't listen. My grandmother told me that my mom wants to come stay with her for a week, and with her voice shaking, she told me that she doesn't want her to. My grandmother can't take a whole week of my mother trying to brainwash her and tell her all these upsetting things. It was the most heartbreaking phone call I have ever been a part of. My grandma is 92 years old, she has survived Covid, the loss of her husband, multiple bouts with cancer, she is a goddamn survivor who doesn't need or deserve this. At this point, I am just completely at a loss. My grandmother told me she feels like she lost her daughter and I feel like I lost my mother. Reading other people's stories has helped a little but at this point I am afraid we may never get my parents back. Thanks for reading, sorry this went on for so long.",QAnonCasualties
18,Has anyone’s Q family or friends had any reaction to the news of Trump getting the vaccine?,My (Q) mom isn’t a Covid denier and was never an anti-masker. She’s had Covid &amp; is dealing with long-hauler issues that have prevented her from returning to work since. She believes that the virus was intentionally made &amp; spread from the lab in China and doesn’t trust the vaccines &amp; refuses to get it. I am hoping the fact that Trump was vaccinated might make her more receptive to getting vaccinated. Has anyone seen any possible change in opinion towards the vaccine?,QAnonCasualties
19,BF is reading conspiracies now,"My boyfriend has been politically neutral historically- mostly because he hasn’t had a desire to pay attention or learn about these things. 

Recently though he’s started watching a lot of Steven Crowder. And today he started talking to me about a video he watched on YouTube about voter fraud... and some blog he read online about how ballots were delivered to the processing building in the cover of night and that people were registered with fake addresses....

I️ feel like he’s creeping into fishy territory. And he can be a little impressionable. He doesn’t really fact check this info and his base response to things is to lean conservative. He says he doesn’t believe it all until he learns more about it but idk if I️ totally believe that. 
I’m just worried he’s gonna slide down a slippery slope to Q anon stuff and wacky, hateful conservative conspiracies. 

What can I️ do? I’m left leaning and I’ve been sharing podcasts and articles that have been as neutral as I️ can get so he’ll read them. Like, the podcast Left Right &amp; Center. Just so he can hear the opinions and reasoning of all sides. But he still hasn’t tried checking all those out.

Tbh this makes me really nervous. Previously I️ wouldn’t have really been bothered by differing political beliefs in a partner, back when it was “one party wants a bridge built in 3 months, one wants a bridge built in 7 months.” But now I️ feel like the parties are separated by moral differences. Which worries me because I️ can see him getting sucked into more hateful stuff and I️ don’t wanna lose him to that kind of propaganda. 

We’ve talked about this a little before. We both try to stay neutral on politics until we have the full picture, which I appreciate. But my natural inclination is to lean left, for him it’s right I️ think. If he were to take a sudden nose dive into like homophobia, nationalist, xenophobic territory I’d call it off immediately- fortunately it’s not there. 

Any advice on how I️ can combat this? Do I️ need to combat this? I️ don’t think he’s gonna believe that Jews with space lasers are gonna rule the world, but he’s not immune from right wing propaganda - especially because he doesn’t have a lot of life experience. Has anyone dealt with this kind of tension between an SO?",QAnonCasualties
20,The bridge too far...,"For several months now, this sub-Reddit has helped me process the loss of a partner who became increasingly radicalized into the Q universe. You all understand the confusion, pain, heartbreak, feelings of hopelessness, and tug-of-war between loving someone and watching the person you love erode in front of your eyes. I have despaired, cried, laughed (the humor in some comments has made things more bearable) along with you, and drawn healing from your sharing; so thank you. 

I write today with a question that has often entered my mind as I read our stories of struggle and loss. It’s the flip-side of the question: Why are people vulnerable to Q narratives? My question, instead, is: What made you immune?

If you’re like me, you probably tried reading and researching just to understand your loved one. What made you stop short and say: I won’t go further.?

I know, when discussing Q, there are objective yardsticks for measuring the descent into unreality. But, I’m more interested in the individual subjective experience of those who resist. I am also an academic and understanding this phenomenon has been one way I have dealt with my personal Q loss.

Trying to understand my partner’s beliefs certainly lead to crumbs of truth that would not have landed on my plate had I not made an effort to understand my Q partner. But, the crumbs didn’t amount to enough for me.

I’m guessing each of us had our moments of disbelief where we had to draw the line, however painful doing that was. I know, for myself, I struggled long with guilt wondering if I was doing the right thing by giving up, trying to understand with each new Q belief why my partner could go there. I’m wondering if you care to share what that experience of discovering your limit was for you. 

In a more general way, I think my question is about the future of the Q universe (which has already started to divest from the Q label). This sub keeps growing everyday and so do movements around the world that draw energy from Q and Q-adjacent narratives. Wealth, education level, family situation seem to matter little in predicting who is vulnerable. Hence, I think, my interest in understanding the other side of vulnerability. 

What prevents some of us from burrowing into the rabbit holes? What made you stop short?

Thank you, in advance, for your insights.",QAnonCasualties
21,Things are Worse Than I Thought,"Has anyone else's Q gotten more aggressive in the past couple of months? I thought things would be getting better, but they're only getting worse. My mom is convinced that Trump is still president and that a huge ""announcement"" will be made revealing everything. She's been saying these things since the inauguration, but I was hoping that it would all die down the more that NOTHING has happened. 

This morning, my Q loved one screamed at me for deciding to get the vaccine. She claimed that I was not going to be able to have kids and that I would have health issues down the road. She said that I was blind to the enemy and that I've been brainwashed??? Then she said that everything is truth and compared herself to Jesus knowing all of these things. I just want this to be over and she doesn't listen to anyone. My stepdad is just enabling her and there's no one to intervene.

22,One of the founders of QAnon is my stalker.,"I just joined the forum in order to be able to post about this.  The man who has stalked me for the last three years is one of the founders of the QAnon scam.  He, like Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys, is the head of an alt right militia -- and himself involved in human trafficking.  I am blogging about this situation, because I feel it is so fundamentally dangerous to our democracy.  [https://thegodfatherconversations.blogspot.com](https://thegodfatherconversations.blogspot.com) QAnon adherents have blogged about ""the storm,"" in which 100,000 Americans were to have been arrested (on false charges) if Trump had been re-elected.  What they don't realize is that those false charges have been ""anchored"" in falsified police reports in law enforcement offices that have been infiltrated by the alt right.  I don't want to enter a heated political debate with anyone, honestly.  I just want to let you know what I know on the chance that it may help you or someone you love.  If you ask questions here, I will do my best to answer them with the information I currently possess.  I believe that access to the full truth is the only way out of the QAnon scam.  People need to know that they have been manipulated as part of a carefully crafted political ploy of the alt right.  Misinformation and democracy cannot co-exist.  We, as a society, have to choose one or the other.  I hope I can contribute to the preservation of our democracy by revealing what I know.  I'm wishing you all the best.

23,Let’s not lose our sense of perspective in all this madness,"The first and main thing I want to say is “We” are the casualties of QAnon, not our Q family member or other loved ones fallen into QAnon.

We the family, the friends, the spouses are the ones suffering the consequences of this mass insanity. I lost a 44 yr marriage to my Qwife over this QAnon Cult.

24,My aunt has progressively gotten worse since Trump's win in 2016 and I fear she is a QAnon believer,"My father's side of the family has always been pretty right-leaning, but it never truly bothered me growing up. I had the privilege of not really caring about politics and considered myself neutral on most issues, but really because I didn't care to do more research. I was a teenager and didn't consider politics to be very important. 

Around late high school, early college I realized my views were definitely more left-leaning. Having different political views from my family didn't bother me at all in the beginning, I figured we'd agree to disagree and move on. Oh no. Despite my family posting conservative Facebook posts frequently (I would never comment on their posts no matter how much I disagreed), the moment I would post anything even implying a left-leaning view, my relatives would always comment and tell me I was wrong.

 One particular Aunt was even worse. She said I was ""seeing the world through rose-colored glasses"" for celebrating the legalization of gay marriage in the United States (this particular comment cut deep because I am a closeted bisexual), she would share articles that I had shared onto my Facebook page, put them on her page and tag me onto the post saying things like ""my niece shared this and I want everyone to see this ridiculous crap"", for people I didn't know to comment and call me an idiot. 

I tried my best to cut ties with that part of the family, but I'll still see my Aunt's posts from time to time (I help out with my mom's Facebook time to time and my mom is still friends with her, so her posts pop up often). My aunt has gotten severely worse.

She frequently posts things about COVID-19 being a hoax, bragging about not wearing a mask, etc. She is also still extremely homophobic and transphobic. She believes the election was a fraud. She bragged about being a conspiracy theorist. Her Facebook account was actually disabled because she would frequently post hateful shit and pure misinformation, but she just created a new account and hasn't stopped posting the same garbage. The last thing she posted was about how the COVID vaccines are dangerous and a hoax. 

She has 3 daughters, the oldest being 14 and starting to share her views.

I feel so very sad that she has doubled down and is on QAnon's side (she hasn't outright said she's apart of it, but all of her posts make me believe so). A part of me wishes I could help her, but I know she would want nothing to do with me and would only continue to antagonize me.",QAnonCasualties
25,Is this real?,"My Qperson (dh) said a few days after Biden was sworn in that he didn't believe all of that anymore. He never talks about it now. I would love to believe him but am cautiously optimistic. 

Before saying this he would argue any counter point I tired to make and even once told me it was what he believed and even said he didn't care if I left him (when I had made no inference to leaving him). The point is he was ALL in. 

The thing is he believed a lot of that stuff LONG before he mentioned any of it to me and it took him several weeks to admit everything he believed (and it was all of it!).

So should I believe that he doesn't believe any of it anymore? Is there anyway to know? Does it matter if he does if he never talks to me about it?",QAnonCasualties

QDad: Well he could be just a good body double.

Me: Totally... But why Biden?
Q Dad: Because they needed someone who would be well spoken and present well to the public.. look presidential. It's making sense now isn't it?
Me: Yeah...just one thing.... Why pick someone who by your own insisting is a demented old bafoon? Not like, Michelle Obama or something. Especially on the heels of that big best selling book. Why not just recruit her... everyone loves her... why murder an old man and replace him with an even more demented old man? Seems over complicated.

28,Colleagues,"I used to be into conspiracies as an adolescent and being able to discuss them as an adult with my coworker X meant that we got along ok. X is a decent person at heart however their views seemed to mimic the views of right wing voices in US politics. Through X I became aware of Q and the more we talked, the more their views became increasingly bizarre, downright annoying and repetitive.

X often mentioned 'pizzagate' and paedophile rings being exclusive to Democratic party candidates

X tried to convince myself that the Capital riots were orchestrated by Antifa members

X tried to convince me that the election was stolen from Trump and he was a faultless person

X repeatedly spoke about Hunter Bidens laptop and 'incriminating evidence'

X would use words such as 'Communist' and 'Socialist' as an insult/to describe people such as AOC and Bernie Sanders. People X deemed spineless and undesirable

X would go as low as mentioning the unattractiveness of Antifa members and how they are misfits of society

X would label groups such as BLM and Antifa as terrorists.

X would tell me that the media lies, unless it supports X's view and that random sources in social media are credible

X would state that being maskless is freedom from being a sheep and vaccinations are high in dangerous metals

Colleague Y who I didnt speak to much placed money on Trump winning the election and has even more bizarre views than X

Friend Z referred to AOC as a demon and when asked why, Z told me that she lies

Im honestly baffled at how easy people fall into the Qanon trap and the worst part about my experience is that WE DONT EVEN LIVE in the United States.

My idiot father, who I love, has fallen down the Q rabbithole. It was amusing at first, but now he's going around maskless plenty of the time, completely ignoring science expert, policy maker, and 90% of the world's consensus that you shouldn't be traveling or hanging out. 

The other day he texted me, he found out he had had Covid-19 about 3 months ago, explaining the lung issues he thought were his ALREADY PRE-EXISTING LUNG ISSUES (how reckless and stupid can you get??), but never apparently got checked out for.

When I urged him to be extra cautious now that he's already weakened by both Covid-19 damage to the lungs (which he should recover from, his doctor says), and his pre-existing lung issues, he only had this to reply:

""I believe we need to build immunity"".

I'm just furious. My roommate, one of my best and dearest friends, the nicest guy you'd ever meet, who would give you the shirt off his back, the food from his fridge and the last dollar in his wallet, just because you asked, lost his father last year to Covid. We're 24-25, it's too fucking young for him to have to experience that, and he has a brother who's even younger. He just lost another uncle over the weekend.

I'm seething that people like my Dad are throwing caution to the wind and endangering people left and right because of this or that bullshit internet theory that tells them not to trust the experts, that it's all a conspiracy.

The sad fact is, my roommate's Dad did everything right, took every precaution, and he died because of people like my Dad, who will continue to brazenly put others at risk.

I'm sure I'm saying this out of anger and frustration, and may regret it in the future, but honest to God in this moment I wish it was my Dad that died instead of my roommate's.

37,Qanon Lite can still complicate life,"So, I have known for many months that I have Q family. At first, I thought they were only being mildly influenced. I thought that since they weren't forcing everyone to believe them, or get away from them, and because they don't scream, accuse, or plot that they were just getting tidbits through their church and Facebook connections. 

A few nights ago, I heard and saw a lot more of their world, and it's a mixed bag because on one hand, I'm really grateful that they aren't frothy and full of ultimatums. On the other hand, it's disappointing and overwhelming to see how surrounded I am by Q influence, and how it compromises their ability to be rational. 

I was shocked to hear a relative go on about how Trump is still secretly in charge, Biden is a doppelganger, and it's all part of a ""larger plan,"" they have faith in. Then, I sat with them as they watched tv, and there's apparently an evangelical tv station specific to the state we live in that featured a whole platform for the My Pillow guy. He really seems to have recently claimed Christian evangelical affiliation to cash in on sales, but he's seen as a blessed guy with inside knowledge. 

These relatives were born in the late 40s. They understand the internet and data caps, are learning about bitcoin, know how to stream, have run businesses, and aren't confused about how to use their phones. They're not stupid, don't reject technology out of hand, and read more than the bible alone. 

Their true sole connection to this stuff is their faith, and church community. They believe all this stuff has to do with god, and godly values. I know it's popular to see all faith and church as inherently stupid and flawed, but I don't agree. In fact, I feel that people's unwillingness to try to find a peaceful compromise between rationality and religious philosophy has given these irrational nightmares the power to flourish.  

My Q family knows I don't hold with Christian or conservative views, and still loves me. They're loving, family oriented people. It's still scary to know that they're waiting for some fantastical conspiracy to unfold. It's disturbing that they could influence minds that are less rational than their own.

Now I need the personal support if possible, I’m just so mad at my mom and the fact that she’s gotten sucked into this and doesn’t seem to care about anything else anymore. (On mobile so sorry about formatting yada yada)

About a week ago I found out a friend had passed away back in November - he was homeless and didn’t have much family left so I only found out because I was checking in on his Facebook and found a bunch of posts from other people who knew him sending their condolences. Anyway, this is the second friend of mine to pass in the last like three months and I texted my mom to let her know and maybe get a little comfort but I haven’t heard from her at all since then. I figured she was busy and would call when she could and cry with me but instead this happened: my brother sent a dumb meme of the Pope holding up an Avril Lavigne CD to our little family Instagram group and my mom sent a message IMMEDIATELY saying something along the lines of “is this the Pope finally acknowledging the existence of clones..??”

I just got so mad... She has the time to spew conspiracy theories when a stupid meme is sent but no time to even offer the slightest comfort to her daughter. I don’t really know what to do, haven’t talked to her about it because I just don’t have the energy to go down the rabbit hole with her right now, not ever but especially right now. 

She’s been conspiracy minded since before I was born so there’s no hope of talking her out of it as far as I’m concerned, but at least when it was chem trails and fluoride in the water and whatever else it really wasn’t harmful... Now it’s baby eating satanists and clones and blah blah blah you all know... I just needed the vent I think, I’m so thankful for this space. I just really really hate that we even need this space though...

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind comments, I did not expect so many though so I’m trying to get a response to you all and I’m sorry if I miss you! I appreciate you all so much",QAnonCasualties

She also said that taxation is illegal, which obviously speaks for itself. I’m really trying to keep my mouth shut but upon hearing the things come out of this woman’s mouth, I really want to say something. I’m sure my mom doesn’t buy into the parts about time travel and about taxation being illegal, but man the things this woman is saying are flat out insane. The thing about qanon is that its adherents think that the people that don’t share their beliefs are crazy.

46,"Qultist is tribal, sexist, ageist, anti-Semitic...","My QPerson is an older relative of mine, and she absolutely despises the Millennial generation for reasons I don’t fully understand. Yes, we’re not perfect, but QPerson (Boomer extraordinaire) is almost rabid in her hatred of us to the point that it’s really just straight up supremacy (she and her WASP-y family have always been very elitist with no reason to be other than maybe some vague old-money connections). That being said, I think she hates my generation because Tucker Carlson probably told her to...

My QPerson also *hated* RBG and is glad she’s dead because she was “an ugly, evil Jewish woman who tried to lower the age of consent!” And of course the ‘wrinkled’ flag on RBG’s casket absolutely 100% signaled that she was a traitor, despite there being no evidence whatsoever to back up this ridiculous claim, and even then it’s obviously just conspiracy bullshit.

So I, as a female in her late-20’s, became concerned about the appointment of that bitch Amy Barrett to SCOTUS—  and who with a functioning uterus wouldn’t be??? If this woman had her way, people could serve life sentences in prison for accidental miscarriages. She is a fascist, authoritarian, Christian extremist piece of shit (and this is coming from a good lapsed Catholic whose family is from New Orleans).

But my QPerson, though she has some feminist views and isn’t totally on board with Barrett (to be fair), turns one helluva blind eye to everything about this woman. The weird sex cult, the authoritarian views, the rushed confirmation...anything that would trigger a Q-Idiot if the dEmOnRaTs had pulled it. But nope...here’s QPerson overlooking all of that because she thinks Barrett is more conventionally attractive than RBG and a Christian.

My Qultist keeps telling me not to worry about Roe v. Wade, saying that if it gets overturned, it’ll go to the states, and they’ll decide. Fine, but I pointed out that Roe v. Wade shouldn’t even be up for discussion at this point. It’s *my* body...NOT God’s, NOT my husband’s, NOT the fetus’s, and sure as hell NOT the fucking states’. But QPerson told me I was overreacting, and basically answered, “If they *do* overturn Roe v. Wade, it’ll be to fight the Deep State!” No it won’t...it’ll be because this country harbors some goddamn deep-seated misogyny and wants to punish women for having sex in any way they can. If they really gave a shit about unborn babies’ lives, they’d be advocating to control men’s bodies, too. Not that I think anyone’s body should be controlled, but...at least have there be some consistency?

Anyway, it took me a bit before I finally realized that my QPerson, aside from her obvious fascist tendencies, just plain doesn’t want any younger women having rights. What does she care...she’s in her mid-60’s. New abortion laws won’t affect her. Besides...*her* perfect generation was the one that jump-started feminism (never mind the Suffragettes, I guess). So, I finally snapped at her during a heated discussion one day and said, “You just hate my generation and want to see us punished for something! That’s why you like Amy Barrett.”

And to that my Qultist replied, in a condescending tone with her nose in the air, “Yeah...there’s some truth to that! Your liberal generation is very spoiled, and it’s high time you all got put in your place on something.” That something being...basic human rights. She doesn’t want the world to be a better place for future generations; she wants to see us suffer under authoritarianism because we’re not as racist, sexist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic as she is, and we don’t worship Donald Trump enough.

48,"A Different Strategy : Prosecute ""Q""","I am so sorry this happened to you, and I’m glad you’ve found this community of others who are facing a similar struggle. As a student, I’m tired of hearing stories from young people who have lost family members to “Q”. As a veteran, I’m tired of hearing about people I used to know who have joined a paramilitary organization after being recruited online from a QAnon forum. To an extent, I believe the advice that not arguing about doctrine or facts with adherents is essentially correct[\[i\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn1), but also misses a key component of what people *can* do about QAnon. Namely, demand the prosecution of the individual(s) who radicalized their loved ones in the first place: “Q”. 

It is rare that a cult is judged to be illegal in the United States, as they are shielded by the religious exercise protections of the First Amendment[\[ii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn2). Instead, successful prosecution typically hinges around charging their leaders for tangential crimes, such as kidnapping or forced imprisonment when they hold members against their will. Regardless of whether QAnon should be considered a cult, the same strategy for prosecution should be pursued. If successful, some people may finally walk away from QAnon. Perhaps more importantly, others may never be radicalized in the first place. 

Former President Trump was recently impeached for inciting a riot at the US Capitol based on his language to supporters. I don’t raise this as a political point, but instead to suggest that “Q” could easily be charged under a similar statute[\[iii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn3). “Q”’s 5000 posts, evidence for such a case, have already been catalogued and preserved[\[iv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn4) by their followers, whether they originally appeared on 4chan, 8chan, or 8kun. Moreover, much of the work of identifying “Q” has already been done by reporters using open-sourced information[\[v\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn5)[\[vi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn6)[\[vii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn7). If the government did decide to pursue legal action against “Q”, naming them wouldn’t require much additional effort. Remember - just because you rob a bank in a mask doesn’t mean you haven’t committed a crime. 

To that end, what I hope you’ll consider doing is writing your elected representatives and asking them what they are doing to prosecute “Q”[\[viii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn8). When you write, help them understand that “Q” is a single account run by an individual or a small team, and that all QAnon theories are held together by this single linchpin.  Tell them that “Q” is not a novelty or a curiosity. They are a dangerous criminal, and they are still at large. To find the representative for where you live, follow this [link](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and enter your home address. Information about your senators can be found [here](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). If you have never written an elected official before, here are some additional pointers on how to effectively communicate with [legislators](https://www.aclu.org/writing-your-elected-representatives). Be direct, be specific, and tie it to your personal experiences wherever possible. It doesn’t even have to be a letter in the traditional sense; all representatives accept comments from their constituents through their websites. Moreover, if you live in a state where similar activity has occurred at a statehouse or governor’s mansion, consider writing local representatives and asking them what they are doing to prosecute under state laws. 

If charging “Q” for the Capitol riots sounds far-fetched, consider Officer Eugene Goodman, one of the heroes of January 6th. The rioter who led the charge against him was not dressed in political merchandise or waving a MAGA flag. Instead, he wore a black sweatshirt embolized with “Q” on it. According to the FBI, he had purposely positioned himself at the head of the mob – “He wanted to have his t-shirt seen on video so that ‘Q’ could ‘get the credit’”[\[ix\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn9). If foreign insurgents had stormed a military outpost with flags and shirts with “Q” all over them, we would know the identities behind the pseudonym already. 

Until “Q” is prosecuted, these tragedies will only continue, and more people will lose family and friends to the fringe. QAnon is already looking to March 4th as the next flashpoint[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn10), but there will always be another date until our leaders act. The House of Representatives came close to this realization a few months ago, when they voted to condemn QAnon and other fringe conspiracy movements[\[xi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn11). However, this condemnation lumped “Q” and those “Q” deceived together. By specifically targeting and prosecuting “Q”, we can begin to recognize those people as victims rather than criminals while simultaneously cutting off a recruiting tool for future extremists. I hope you will write and demand justice, both for yourselves and those too far gone to demand it themselves. As much of a long-shot as it might seem, it might be the best way to get them back.

49,Progress: good days and bad days,"...and I mean good and bad days for ME and my outlook! This is incredibly long and rambly, but maybe it will help someone. I'm mostly just typing it up for myself.

I found this sub about a month ago, and it made me pretty depressed. It was obvious that this is what had gotten into my SO of 4 years during covid. Over the summer, he got more interested in ""politics"", decided he was a libertarian now, and was visibly more angry and depressed (but never violent/physical, or anything towards me, I just didn't like his moodiness). I heard about redpills, new world order, technocracy, microchips in vaccines, and 5G. Most of the crazier-sounding bits were kept to himself, like he'd say something vague like ""all politicians are evil"" (to which I was like ""duh"" or ""of course""). All of the jargon sounded like nonsense, I brushed most of it off and said I didn't like to talk about politics with him. Mostly he just wouldn't shut up about it and wouldn't stop listening to it and it wasn't nice conversation. I told him that I couldn't be his politics buddy and that's okay, we can be partners without that, he needs to hang out with friends more and talk about this stuff with them instead. He never talked about Q directly.

When I found this sub it was a huge relief to find out what was happening, where it was all coming from. It was also very concerning with wtf he's gotten into! Even now, reading some of the more intense stories on here can make me really question my future with this man. Some days I try to figure out how things would go if we broke up (we aren't married but we live together and our lives are very intertwined). It's really hard not having him to talk to about this since I don't have many friends and don't see them with the pandemic going on. 

But I've learned a lot from all of you. I started to listen to him a little more. I told him that gaslighting me into thinking I disagreed with him only because I ""didn't know"" wasn't fair and I told him I plan to get the vaccine. I started disagreeing with him on specific points (just like ""that doesn't seem likely"" or ""what if that doesn't happen"" or just straight up ""I don't think that is true""). I've started googling the people he listens to (which seems really icky and dishonest, as does posting here!). I've gotten more insight into where he stands on things and we've started having date nights and I started trying to distract him away from his podcasts and computer outside of work hours as much as possible.

Whenever he suggests moving to a specific place or changing something about our life I question how genuine it is - is this him wanting this or did people on the internet suggest it? In reading a lot of the posts here I realized eventually that I just need to recognize my boundaries, which has mostly turned into me not being open to changing our original plans. But if he insists on breaking the law or making a change that I don't want, I will draw the line - either by telling him that this is not okay or by ending things then. This realization of my own boundaries made me feel a lot better overall. The problem with this (and what I've been trying to return to normal) is that now \*I'm\* not open to new ideas about our life together! I've been clinging to our original plans so much that I'm not considering alternatives like I normally would. 

For awhile I feel like I was faking everything just trying to figure out what was going on while remaining as supportive as I could. But I feel like as I understand things more I can see \*him\* again. He has some crazy ideas, but he's always had crazy ideas. I love his ability to question the status quo. I hated that he was angry about everything all the time and obsessed with his podcasts. Those things still happen but they are less frequent (as long as he isn't just hiding them now). 

I've learned how he got into all of this between documentaries and listening to him (and eavesdropping on his podcasts...). He is a tech-savvy, religious white dude who always wanted to quit his job and go live in the woods. There is a very specific group catering to these guys as part of the alternative medicine type Qs. I believe him when he says he has started to focus on the real content - stuff about things we've always watched. But it's like he's watching stuff we've always been into with ads for Q baked in or something. It's so hard to separate for me, whenever I see him listening to podcasts or watching whatever the hell platform the videos he's watching are on, I think he's just being further indoctrinated. But I have hope that it's not all pure Q stuff. It's never been like 100% of the most crazy theories like some of the rest of the people written about here, but a lot of the main ideas are there. It's like they cater to certain people by filtering out the less-believable stuff. 

He told me at some point that he no longer things that there are chips in the vaccine. But he still hates most vaccines. He bought some crypto, but not much and I convinced him to also save money in traditional USD as well. We have a small stock of food that I think is reasonable to be prepared for any disaster. We talk more and have date nights and have committed to going outside as much as possible as the weather gets better. Sometimes he talks about moving to a specific state (which I think is because of taxes or laws or something) and I remind him that we like the area we already picked.

My only real issue is the thing where we are having a discussion and his brain gets stuck on a Q thing that he has to tell everyone about, which interrupts me or others, or ignores where a conversation is going to go back to what is stuck in his brain. But he has this issue anyways (pre-Q). I'm trying to get better at calling him out. Sometimes he doesn't hear something like ""I need you to run the dishwasher after dinner"" because he's thinking about Q things, and then \*real\* things don't get done. It's frustrating but he knows he does it and is getting less argumentative when I call him out. It does feel like the anger is subsiding, at least a little bit.

I still love him. Besides ""politics"", we've always been a great match (as most of the other Qs, he's always been right-leaning). He hasn't done anything but be angry and repeat things he's heard and he was a victim of this nonsense (I'm including the gaslighting in the ""repeating"" part, we all know that's drilled into them!). And as far as I can tell, this subset of ideas was never the homophobic/racist/etc bunch, at least on the surface. They at least \*think\* they're doing things for the greater good. It's exhausting having to shut down theories or ideas one by one and I get scared and confused whenever I read some of the posts on here (I literally have to keep myself off of this sub sometimes, it can be as addicting as Q itself, lol). But the lines of communication are wide open and he's been very receptive to my points. I think he realizes what is at stake. 

I'm hopeful that as we can go do things outside things will improve. This damn pandemic needs to go away so these Qs can get out of their depression and back to talking to real humans.",QAnonCasualties
50,Losing my mom,"I’ve never been in a situation where someone close to me, a blood relative, would give me up for a belief. When I think about it, my brain immediately sludges down to one point of consciousness, &amp; that’s me remembering to breathe. And it’s not even a good belief. Let’s try it out with some other big belief: Mom might say, “People should have freedom of religion. I don’t even have to listen to your arguments; you’re simply wrong. I will never agree with whatevTHIS is,” gestures to the scattered supplies &amp; a booklet entitled, “pipebomb making at home, by boys club press.” OK now in that formula, sure you’d see the mom’s viewpoint. “He kept breaking into the house &amp; stealing stuff. What could I do? I had to change the locks.” But....that Democrats are evil? That’s it? 

I’m her only child. My child is her only grandchild. I think she’s about ready to disown me, &amp; probably not will me the land I grew up on. We’re from rural Alabama. Family is everything there. Moved north for work when I was a kid. To PA, which I recently heard is called Alabama North. That’s about right, I’ll tell you. Still, I feel my mom raised me to be fair, to see people equally. She had discomfort with this in person, but it was clearly the goal she reached for, for both of us. 

She remarried some years ago. Her husband was from right down the road. Ex-military, green beret in Korea. He’s that odd contradiction you see in some military people, in which they’ve traveled a lot, yet have not been broadened by it. Because every time they saw a foreign population, they were trying to kill each other. (He’s fought “a lotta them little brown people in KO-RE-a.) So he’s had her watching fox since before trump was elected. It’s all they watch. Now she says the blacks are laughing &amp; singing in the verizon store, the Koreans are buying up all the land around Atlanta, that you can’t even drive on the highways around Atlanta because you’ll be carjacked by “big black men with guns, &amp; antifa.” (She said she saw a picture of a young man on tv &amp; he was wearing a shirt that said antifa &amp; so that’s how she knows it’s real.) She says there is a mosque somewhere out in the woods where she lives, &amp; there’s no road going to it. She says the local town has these middle eastern looking men who are so rude to women &amp; she’s heard they keep their people in compounds &amp; they run the new commercial hog farm &amp; are dumping everything into the creek &amp; now the creek is dead. I lamented sadly about all the tent cities popping up here in Seattle. She said they have some around there in the nearby city, &amp; “those people are just lazy. They just don’t want to work. Just looking for a handout.” I mean she’s saying this about people living on parking berms, in the winter, in tents. Oh, almost forgot - the Mexicans are taking all the carpentry jobs in north Alabama. 

Did I leave anyone out? Black, antifa, anyone remotely Asian, all middle eastern, Mexican, homeless people. 

There are more than a few routes into this “caramel corn in my head” condition. In her case, she doesn’t partake of Qanon. She is not nimble on the computer, &amp; she’s in a rural area, so the connection sucks, because it’s a monopoly out there. So she’s not learning anything q-ish online. And of course fox isn’t going to say anything bad about them, if they say anything at all.

She LOVES nature, which the GOP hates. I might have predicted that she’d hear about Trump removing protections somewhere, &amp; that would make her a one issue voter. Yea...nope. 

And I don’t think she thinks Trump is the messiah, or the best president, or any of that. 

It seems to be that she just hates democrats. Which is interesting. Fox &amp; their ilk don’t need to sell any one idea hard enough to make people buy it. It’s enough to have a low murmur of ear fluff, as long as it’s unceasing. My impression is my mother doesn’t have even one strong opinion on any position or topic. She’s just been spending every evening listening to her husband yell in agreement with fox, which is just about at the point of declaring Democrats have cooties. 

So...that’s it. She hates the democrats. She probably knows about 3 democrats personally, she’s related to all three, so what are you gonna do? So aaaaaaaaaaaaall the rest of the hated democrats are people she’ll never met, never talk to, nothing. And she’ll give up her only child &amp; grandchild for that. People after the election “oh, we shouldln’t be harsh, we need to reach across the aisle.” Are you kidding me? This is my OWN MOTHER &amp; she might as well be living on Mars. It just breaks my heart. For both of us. She seems miserable. But she’s where she wants to be. The people encouraging these beliefs have that cult rule of -if anyone is asking questions, it’s because they are the enemy &amp; they are trying to keep you from believing THE TRUTH. I reach out to her, but before we even make contact she’d skittered away, hissing &amp; spitting. 

As to the vaccine, here comes another example of how one can pick &amp; choose from the conspiracies like a brain fat buffet. She DOES believe in COVID, as well as vaccines. She &amp; he are old. I suspect your willingness to forego medical care just to show you’re not a sheeple can by highly correlated with your age. I know they wear masks, &amp; isolate. And, boy, out there in the country, that isolation stuff is real. Her husband got his first shot in December, I think; at the VA because he’s a vet. She, 80, was unable to find a vaccine. 

About 2 weeks before the inauguration, we had the following discussion. She said, “remember I said Bob got his first shot?” “Yea,” I said, “when does he get is 2nd?” Her voice gets hard. “He’s not. Biden said they have to give out all the vaccines now, so there won’t be any 2nd vaccines. He tried to get a shot at the hospital. They said they didn’t have any because Biden made them give them all out. And that they weren’t allowed to give them any of what they had.” (They have them &amp; also they don’t have them??) I was exasperated. “Listen, I’m sure Biden &amp; Harris will do the best with... (the hot mess they’ve been left with, I’m thinking...) what they have,” I finish. “Biden &amp; Harris ARE the problem!” She shrieked. Then hung up. She does a lot of hanging up. 

Shortly after, I sent a newsy letter. Had to insert a line saying Biden hadn’t been inaugurated yet, so he had literally no power over any of their vaccine experiences. 

She said she couldn’t find a place to get the shot. I went online &amp; used the PA heat map to find a spot over the mountains, about an hour away. She called &amp; told me they told her to try back in 6 months. Hmmmmm do I have doubts? Maybe so, maybe so. That evening I call &amp; say I found 8 places in one town, also about an hour away. The next day I call &amp; she says none of them have anything (which is the opposite of what the state vaccine map says). I offer to keep looking. She starts ranting that it’s all political, that the whole world is political. And I thought, she’s not going to get a vaccine. It’s not because she believes they implant chips, it’s not because god will heal everything, it’s not because it would prove Covid is real. One reason: Biden prevented the shots when Trump was still in office. If she gets a shot now, now that Trump is OUT of office, it means Biden did something right, or at least will get the credit (in her fevered brain) because he’s president when she gets her shot. On a related &amp; highly infuriating side note, they do have the vaccine in the small town 10 min down the road. But the state line is between her &amp; there. It’s 5 miles from her house. She can’t go there, she has to go over the mountains, an 80yo at the wheel. 

Do you see the level of crazy here? She would rather skip a potentially lifesaving vaccine, which she fully believes in, just to own the libs. “Biden can’t do anything right.” *cough*

If she had cancer, or just dropped down dead, there would be a marker for me. A thing to say, “Here, start mourning NOW. Go find a book about losing someone to cancer. Join an online support group for sudden death.” We have maps for these things. For me, every phone call puts me in mourning. I don’t know where this is going. There is no medicine she can take for this, to make her regain her health. It’s just sad. I’m sad.",QAnonCasualties
51,I miss my mom so much.,"Edit: This kind of blew up so I edited out some of the more specific details, but everything you guys are saying is so helpful and so appreciated. I hope I can get back to everyone who has responded but if I don't, know your support has been super appreciated. 

I'm making my first post here because I'm so sick and sad I don't know what to do. My mom was always my best friend, the person I went to for everything under the sun. She's always been a republican, and I went from being her good republican daughter to a total democrat (I'm in my 30s now), but even then we still had a great relationship as long as we avoided political discussions. Now everything is different.

I don't know if she's into Q specifically, but she is deep in the conspiracies that I believe Q is rooted in. Every once in while over the past decade (at least) she'd bring up something about the New World Order and other associated stuff. I never took it seriously and shut it down. It seemed about as harmful as talking about alien abductions and area 51. (Now seeing advice on how to deal with loved ones in a cult, I feel like I handled everything wrong and it is so hard to not blame myself for dismissing her and for the times our political conversations actually devolved into yelling matches.)

But now with the pandemic, she has gone off the rails. Gradually she got sucked into this mindset that Covid is fake. Or it's not fake and it was created in a lab. The number of deaths is inflated. Doctors are refusing to treat patients with actual life savings drugs (hydroxychloroquine, etc). The vaccines are unsafe. And because of her beliefs, she continues to live her life like nothing is happening.

[This is where a lot of the post got really specific so please forgive me for deciding to remove it.]

I guess maybe this is only loosely related to this sub, being that she has very Q beliefs about the virus. There are other things too, like how all of the main stream news is fake and the election was stolen. The thing is, she always disliked Trump... up until the election. I have been to afraid to ask her specifically about Q, but like I said, she's been into the OG conspiracy stuff for years so it seems likely. She sees everything happening now as proving all of her theories right, that this has all been planned for the last 50 years.

I'm sorry this is so long. I've spent a lot of time yesterday and today crying and talking to my fiance and trying to wrap my head around what's happening, I think it's time I have a wider support group. It just sucks so much.",QAnonCasualties
52,They finally mentioned adrenochrome. They surprisingly still don't know much about Q.,"I have a family member who's... definitely into conspiracy theories. Granted, they were usually the funny and harmless ones like aliens, cryptids, and area 51. We saw a QAnon sign in front of a house and they asked me what it was, so I basically infodumped everything. I even cited my sources. 
They genuinely recognized most of it. I explained that a lot of Q stuff has roots in antisemitism, and they thankfully believed me... on some of it. They still believe in the adrenochrome thing, and seemed to imply that the antisemitism connection is an unfortunate coincidence. They still didn't recognize the name Q, they didn't know what 4chan is, and they didn't know about the whole ""jfk is alive"" theory. I'm hoping that stays that way. I recommended a few debunking videos (""In Search of a Flat Earth"" by... I forgot the guy's name, and ""What is QAnon?"" by iiluminaughtii), and I'm desperately praying that they take the hint. They're by no means a hateful or bad person. They aren't racist, they don't force their politics on anyone, they aren't homophobic or transphobic, etc. But I've heard stories from this sub about previously kind people practically changing overnight. I almost feel like sticking around on this sub was like... God warning me, or something. I dunno. I just needed to vent, I guess.",QAnonCasualties
53,My 79 year old grandma doesn't want to take the coronavirus vaccine.,"Well, she is not exactly a Qanon causality, but she is the the equivalent here in Brazil. She always believed in many strange naturopaths snake oils, so she was always at risk to become a QAnon causality. She started believing in many right wing WTF conspiracy theories during the 2018 elections (she voted for the fascist candidate, bolsonaro). I already knew what would happen. I tried to to stop it but in the end I was powerless. The only social media she uses is whatsapp and talks mostly to other ""qanon"" people, so the few hours per week of help didn't work. Since March, she only talks about bill gates and the globalists, evil vaccines and all that bullshit. She is antimask (wears them because it's mandatory) and believes that taking vitamin d makes you immune to covid (and believes in chlorochlorine). At first she believed it was just a little flu but after many people she knew died (more than 10) she changed her mind, but still refuses to be vaccinated. What can I do do change her mind?

56,"I know, and I'm trying very hard not to hold it against you.","My dad is a member of the Qult. He was always very narcissistic growing up, a dictator in his own home.  He beat me for everything from bad grades to back talking.

I have a few good memories with him, but most of my memories revolve around walking on eggshells because I was scared of him.  When I was a teen, he let me read his journal (which, looking back, was more of a manifesto) and one of the things he wrote in it was that he believed that all addicts should be forced to consume every bit of drugs found on them if and when arrested, whether it kills them or not.  Thats the kind of person he is.  He has no empathy.  

I wound up addicted to meth at one point. (Thank god ive been clean for quite a few years now, no thanks to him.)  He still believes these things knowing that I used to be an addict.

Now on to the meat of the story.

I havent had a relationship with him for years, but somehow we bonded over NASCAR recently.  I started playing iracing and he asked me to make youtube videos so that he could watch me race.  We started watching NASCAR together (from opposite ends of the country) this year.

During this whole time he has been saying nasty things about liberals, using the word ""lib #%$@"" ect.  But even though im a liberal, I just ignore it because I want to have this relationship with him.  I havent told him I'm a liberal, I just ignore his rants or change the subject.

The other day I told him I really liked Bubba Wallace (he is a black nascar driver and advocate of black lives matter)  and my dad said he wasnt thrilled with him BECAUSE of black lives matter.  

He spouted that nonsense about ALL lives mattered the same, and I figured it was safe to teach him that its not about black people thinking they were better, it was about cops treating them as if they were inferior.  

""Its not black lives matter MORE, its black lives matter TOO""

His response was that they should change the slogan to be less confusing.  I dropped it then, but I should have told him that its NOT confusing except to the people that were the problem.

The other day we were talking about how the NASCAR championship works and he made a comment ""Nascar must be run by liberals, they make everything so hard""

I figured this was pretty tame, so I said ""I guess this is a good time to tell you that I'm a liberal""

I guess I figured that if he knew, hed ease up on the hurtful remarks.  This wasnt really the case though, because the next words out of his mouth were probably the most hurtful things he's ever said to me.

""I know and I'm trying very hard not to hold it against you""

All I replied was ""me too, so lets not talk politics at all""  and he POUNCED on that idea and made it his own.  

""Yeah we can either fight or we can talk racing, but we cant do both, I vote racing""

This was a week ago, and I have to give him this, he hasnt made any more comments.

I keep going back to that ""I know, and I'm trying hard not to hold it against you.""  This bothers me and is eating me up on so many levels.

First of all, how dare he? I can understand thinking those thoughts, because I feel the same way about him... But how dare he voice them to me like that?  Making me feel like its a chore to love me?  I mean I DID say ""me too"" to him, but that was a reflex.  He hurt me and I lashed out.  Very tamely I might add.

Secondly, and heres where it gets worse....

If he knew, then he was making all thise comments KNOWING it was hurtful to me.

If he didn't know, then he was lying to me.  Which is some REAL bullshit because he used to beat me when he caught me in a lie, and then beat me again over whatever I lied about.

I think that it might be in my best interest to just drop him completely, but for some reason I really dont want to.  Its so hard to just let go.  I dont know what to do here.

Sorry for the rant, I know this isnt r/relationship_advice but I needed somewhere to vent.

Thanks for listening.

She actively communicates with QAnon members, something she denied before. She's back to advocating a violent revolution, if needed, though she says she would not partake. She  made herself late for work trying to convince me that 10% of people in the world now believe as she does, and that more are ""waking up"" every day.   


I'm heartbroken again, and not sure how much longer I can persevere in trying to save her. Trying to save us.  I have reading I need to do for Dr. Hassan, but I can't even motivate myself to do that.

63,The conspiracy conspiracy,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but seeing as how many of the posts here talk about losing loved ones to conspiracy theories, i think it may be appropriate.

My mother, grandfather and many friends and acquaintances have all been, for lack of a better word, possessed by this conspiracy mind virus that has been going on. I'm not from the US, but i find many similar elements of the QAnon conspiracy spreading even here.

""Bill Gates and the satanic elite have created the coronavirus as an excuse to chip us all so that we can be mind controlled  by the 5G network! Oh and they're all blood drinking pedophiles hell-bent on putting placentas and aborted foetuses into LITERALLY EVERYTHING""

This is only a slight exaggeration, but only a slight one, as anyone who has spent an extended amount of time speaking to these people can attest.

That isn't to say that every conspiracy theory is necessarily false, just look at MK Ultra. Though there's a slight leap i believe between ""the government is doing shady shit and ""there's a cabal of satanists trying to murder the planet, who may or may not be lizard people (read: jews)""

Trying to shoot down the many.. many obviously false and ludicrous claims has drained a lot of my energy, and quite frankly a good chunk of my sanity too. Why? Well, here's an example:

Early on in the pandemic there were images and stories floating around of a green canister with ""COVID-19"" photoshopped on it. If i remember correctly the image itself was older than the pandemic by quite a lot, besides the fact that it was painfully obvious that the text was added digitally. 
Well, not obvious enough apparently as it spread through social media of many different countries.

Or how about that ""5G tower motherboard with COVID19 printed on it"", that was actually taken from an old VCR? Like you could look it up by a code printed on the board and see where it came from.

This wasn't just random misinterpretation of information that just became viral, this was purposeful disinformation put out there to feed into this growing lunacy. Why? Is it 4chan just pulling shit to mess with people to get a laugh? It's either that, or there's a conspiracy to spread conspiracies around to put the masses into panic mode so that no one gets vaccinated and we all DIE or the global economic system collapses and the lizard people can finally take over the world and drink baby blood out of capri sun packages!

You see what this shit is doing to me? I'm not actually serious about the second part of what i wrote but goddamn does the madness spread. And there's nothing you can do about it.
It has become like a religion, and your belief in the conspiracy is the only way you can reach salvation and therefore those caught in this madness believe it's their moral duty to convince you that it's true so that you don't get microchipped by Microsoft!

Who the fuck keeps spreading these lies? Why?! AAAAAGH!

Hey all, new here. My mom has really been into QAnon ever since it got started and all I hear about these days is her talking about all of the messed up theories and I haven't been able to have a ""normal"" conversation with her since the pandemic started. She has always been very far right and it just got worse in the months leading up to Trump's inauguration in 2016, but this is a new level of messed up stuff.

 Background info:  At first, when the 2016 presidential campaigns started, she supported Ted Cruz and she didn't support Trump until my grandparents told her that they supported him, showing all of these (in my opinion) stupid reasons and overall showing that they didn't really respect minorities and LGBT+ people. I came out as a lesbian when I was 13 (so, almost 7 years ago as I'm almost 20 now) and I knew that they didn't really support me from how they reacted (mom tried to say that I didn't know what I was feeling/talking about, grandparents threatened my parents to essentially lock me away in my room and take away my phone). So, when the 2016 election came about, my grandparents and my mom were actively and openly supporting Trump. That felt like a huge blow to me because of me being LGBT+. But, that's not the end of that. All of them are transphobic and I realized that I was genderqueer/fluid within the past year and I told that to my parents. My mom reacted super badly and my dad didn't say much and it was overall an awful experience. I've never told my grandparents about it, knowing how they reacted to me coming out as gay because they're more transphobic than homophobic. So, I didn't feel safe to tell them. My dad isn't in this equation much because he has always been afraid of telling my mom what he thinks about things and he's a pretty quiet guy, versus my mom being a very loud person. He's very much a guy that gets walked all over when it comes to her and he has some bad mental health issues. I, also, suffer with a bunch of mental health problems, including MDD, C-PTSD, possibly AvPD (still going to therapy to see if I do have that, but I show pretty much every single symptom), severe anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and a bunch of other things. So, I've been pretty much labeled as a sick person who doesn't know themself and is just crazy. My dad, on the other hand, is kinda a pushover.

How it started: Before quarantine, when all of the COVID stuff was new on the news, my mom and grandparents took it seriously and took the needed precautions for things. But then, my mom doing info research on COVID stuff, she came across QAnon stuff and that's when things started going downhill. She became obsessed with the things those people were talking about and taking them as fact. At first I was like, oh this isn't too serious and just some more bs she hears from far right people. But, oh my god I was so wrong. 

How it's going: She got more and more into QAnon and to the point where she wouldn't talk to me or my dad because she'd be watching another video of that stuff. Anytime I would address it and how it was complete bs, she would say that I've been brainwashed and that I need to listen to her because she's right. Then, anytime I tried to challenge the things she has ""learned"" from her QAnon videos, she'd get really angry, start saying that no one takes her seriously, and that we think that she's stupid. It got to the point where she was victimizing herself. I talked to my therapist about it and my sister (who has been moved out since 2017 and isn't into QAnon and is very much the opposite of my mom and grandparents) and they both suggested that I should ask her to not talk about politics and the like around me. So, I asked her and she essentially said that that's ""part of her personality and that she's trying to save people from the bad people in the world"". I still tried to let her know how it made me feel (anxious, on edge, scared, etc.), but she didn't listen. She keeps talking about the QAnon stuff and idk what to do anymore. It just sucks so much because she essentially supports people who are against people like me (LGBT+) and even my dad (he's mixed, half Asian/a PoC). It's like a blow to the heart anytime she talks about it and I can't move out yet because I've been working on my mental health issues (which have been really bad), so I haven't been able to work to get the money to leave. I spend so many nights crying because I feel like I don't know my mom or grandparents anymore and I keep asking myself why and how did this happen. I've been trying to educate my mom about the LGBT+ community and trying to talk to her about the struggles PoC go through (that white privilege is real), but she never listened.

It feels like a lot of the time, I failed in educating her about those groups of people who have more difficult lives than she does just based off of their race or sexual/gender identity because QAnon is very much not supportive of BLM and couldn't care less about LGBT+ people and what they/us go through. I've tried playing devil's advocate for the opposing side of what she believes, but it doesn't make a difference. Things still stay the same. She has turned into this cold hearted, distant person and it doesn't even feel like I have a mother anymore. She goes to a bunch of Trump rallies, protests, and is an anti-masker. I don't even know what she's doing day by day because she doesn't tell me and I wake up nearly every day to her being gone. She would tell my dad in passing as she's going out to where she was going and what she was doing, but she wouldn't tell any of us ahead of time. I hardly ever really see her anymore and I just feel a profound sense of loss from how far gone she is into QAnon. It's like the empathy for other people has been sucked out of her and replaced by a QAnon programmed robot. She used to be such a nice woman that would listen to other people's thoughts, feelings, and opinions and would put herself in their shoes. Now, all I have to compensate for that is a whole closet full of food and stuff that she's hoarding when (in her words) ""shit goes down"" and the QAnon stuff goes into effect. Idk what to do and I struggle with seeing how that stuff makes sense at all. A lot of it feels like a stretch and a lot of it doesn't add up to me. She praises Trump like he's Jesus himself and I don't understand how someone can support someone like him. I'm a very empathetic person, to a fault, but I'm struggling to make sense of it all. At the same time, none of it makes sense. It feels like I'm going crazy and I'm glad that I was able to find this community because it has been such a lonely and anxiety inducing situation. It has effected my sleep profoundly (I've had bad insomnia from it and I'm on sleep meds, so it's been THAT bad) and I'm just lost. Idk what to do anymore or what to feel.",QAnonCasualties

84,How can I heal someone else's strong sentiment against Authority?,"Nice to meet you all, I did not know something like this existed, and I appreciate any response from you all.

I want to say that I believe from watching my mother that most of her belief in this kind of ideas comes from her strong rejection of authority, she was raised only by my grandmother, we all love grandma but she has always been very distrustful of anyone trying to ""control"" her, she had some bad experiences with our grandfather and multiple people on her life that left her wanting to be alone and trying to be the only variable that controls her life (and god too), she sees with disgust and distrust people like politicians, cops, rich people, etc anyone that is in a position of more power than her.

My mother is aware of that behavior from my grandmother but she can not see that she carried some of that herself, maybe not in the same way but she has the belief that it's important to protect her individuality from being restricted if my grandmother would refuse to call the police because she doesn't trust men coming to her house even if they could do, god knows what to her daughter, my mother would not be as irrational but would do things like changing her path if police are on sight, even though she is not doing anything wrong, try to go through closed roads even though they are marked as dangerous as not to fall prey in her mind to some sort of sheep mentality, doesn't believe in the Christian God because our grandmother ( which is valid but we can see the resentment towards grandma and she trying to force her religion ).

This even if subtle translates to a lot of things in my mother's life, we all know she does this and nobody looks at it as something dangerous, heck compared to what our grandmother does is nothing. That was before she started watching conspiracy theories with my father.

My father and the rest of the family began to watch this kind of stuff on cable and on the internet and quickly lost interest in the thing but my mother kept on watching it on her phone in her free time, she would comment us this and that and we would just take it as a simple conversation. Now we have begun to worry about her, she refuses to wear a mask, we had to vaccinate our little brother behind her back as not to annoy her. Se didn't go to vote because she said the elections are meaningless now but the thing that worried us the most is that she managed to find people with similar ideas to her and began to go to a club to talk about these conspiracies and they almost went to that rally to ""stop Biden"".

I feel lucky that is not something as severe as it could be, but since we realize the danger that these things can make, I have taken to myself to help her.

But I don't know if is possible for me to help her, every time we try to speak with her she gets defensive and it always goes back and forth into the same thing, she feels she is liberating herself in some way shape, or form and that she can not place her trust on other people and she is constantly looking for some sort of impossible independence from everything.

I didn't know it was a sentiment that came from conspiracies, she has this idea of some utopia without the influence of the massive media (except for the ""alternative media""), without technology (except her phone) with free spirituality (these cheap ""new era"" **enlighten** that these groups tend to sell).  We used to joke with her that that's what grandfather used to have when he was a farmer and he still passed away from drinking his troubles away.

We feel she disconnects more and more from reality and we want to stop it now that is early. any comments would help. Thanks in advance.",QAnonCasualties
85,How did this even happen?,"So, I've got an aunt who has always been my role model. She was the first woman in my family to graduate from college. She went on to earn her masters. Her ex-husband and her son are both licensed medical doctors. They're all anti-vaxing trump supporters. When she started sharing Alex Jones stuff on her Facebook a few years back I called her on it. Nicely suggested that she might want to check sources. She accused me of being negative. Her adult kids are hanging out on Parler. They apparently buy all the conspiracy theories. Oh, also fundamentalist ""Christians"" and prone to MLM scams.

I've lived on the East Coast for 30 yrs. We all knew what an utter POS trump was. Everyone knows someone who has been stiffed by him. Nothing but a con artist and a money launderer. How did this bloviating dinosaur, who, btw, owned a ""modeling"" agency that employed hundreds if not thousands of underaged girls, come to be seen as the ""Christian Savior"" who is going to expose Dems no less and save girls from human trafficking?

87,I am a former believer in Q and this is what changed my mind,"**(throwaway to protect my identity)**  


I would like to offer you good people an additional angle when talking to Q believers that I haven’t seen here so far.

I will describe the thinking-process that led to my rejection of Qanon and then some pointers that may help inducing this process in others.  

**My process**  



After descending deeper and deeper into everything Q, I was suffering a psychotic breakdown. I realized I could no longer discern truth from fiction and fell into a deep depression for two weeks. As an unintended side-effect, I went through a digital detox.

And here is the epiphany that got me back into real-life: 

There are two possibilities: Either Q is right or Q is wrong. It would have to be one or the other. If Q is wrong, then there is no need for me to busy myself with it. If, however Q is right, then…what? Why would I need to follow every new piece of information being dropped? If it is all true, then all should be revealed soon, for everyone to see. In that case, there is also no need for me to busy myself with it.

This realisation might seem unsatisfying at first, but it taught me an almost spiritual lesson: 

There are things in this world that I do not know and cannot know for sure. And that is ok.

I was lucky to come to that realisation by my own, but not everyone will. So here are some angles that might help move someone else there.  


**Digital Detox**  


Information addiction is a real thing. Small bits of information that are just interesting enough but don’t challenge our short attention spans. Twitter et al. know this, news-channels know this, and so do conspiracy boards. So try to convince the person to do this. Hell, make it a challenge and join in yourself (this is beneficial for everyone).  


**Be humble and avoid authority arguments**  


Authority arguments (i.e. referring to scientists or whatever news outlet you deem reputable) cannot work because central part of Qanon is the untrustworthiness of those institutions. And be honest, your trust in those institutions is just that – trust (however legitimate it might be). Instead, be humble and go for the angle I described in my epiphany.  


**Don’t equate conservatism with Q**  


While reading some posts in this sub I got the impression that most users here hold left-leaning views, which is of course legitimate. I held conservative views before I got into Q and I still do. If questioning Q would have meant questioning my whole political identity, I doubt I would’ve gotten out. This is a mental health issue, not a political one.  

**EDIT 1**  

Please don't derail this into a discussion about politics. I am aware that the vast majority if not all Q believers hold conservative views. My point is that it is easier to give up Q if that doesn't mean you have to give up long held political views.

**EDIT 2**  

I should have mentioned I am from Germany. We have a sizeable Q movement here. Please stop asking me about my opinions on US politics.

**EDIT 3**  

There's a lot of questions about the state of Q in Germany coming in, so here is an article in [english](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/world/europe/qanon-is-thriving-in-germany-the-extreme-right-is-delighted.html) and one in [german](https://www.swr.de/swr2/leben-und-gesellschaft/qanon-wie-die-verbreitung-in-deutschland-funktioniert-100.html). Personally, I did not use german channels at all but american ones. I got in and out before it really got big here.  

**EDIT 4**  

It seems like I ruffled some feathers with this post. I am open to discussion but before you comment, please read the existing comments first. There is a moderate to high likelihood that I already responded to the point you want to raise. Thank you.",QAnonCasualties

89,Q husband,"Hi. I’m new here and my heart is breaking.  My husband is a true believer of Q. It has happened in such a short time too. It’s been 2 months that he really took hold of it and ran with it. He has other family members that believed before him but they got him.  It has greatly affected our marriage and it was already suffering. We decided to do counseling before he really fell down the hole and we can’t even work on those issues because this takes priority in counseling. We were raised very conservative Christian but as adults had more progressive Christian views but now he’s like brimstone and fire. Things we were against before. Says God has told him to spread the “good news” about the second harvest. Believes all these people are alive. Just 3 months ago we talked about how we both agreed Michael Jackson was a bad man and he said he was a sick fuck. Now, Michael Jackson faked his own death because he had to and was wrongfully accused. And is posing as The Weeknd? What?!?!  I’m a stay at home mom, without an income. He seems to think all debt is going to be wiped away because of all the silver and gold they found under the Vatican. Doesn’t want to pay credit card or other types of bills and to “just wait”.  Talks about going to get me a new car. We have 3 amazing beautiful children. People are like just leave. Ugh it’s not that simple. My kids depend on me for 90% of their lives. He can’t work and take care of them and frankly i prefer that he’s not around them as much right now because of his views. I want to fight for our marriage but i am exhausted. I’ve been reading tips on how to deal with these people. I’m trying to come at him with love but I’m just heartbroken. This is destroying our marriage and family. All logic out the window. He constantly repeats “wait and see” and “ the hope and faith i feel is incredible”. Just wanted to share my story for others who might feel alone in this and for my own support.",QAnonCasualties
90,Gave up arguing,"Every time another ""big prediction"" didn't come true I was hoping there could be a chance that I get my dad back and would be able to have a conversation with him that wouldn't end in an argument. My last hope was that after Biden's inauguration he would finally start to question all this nonsense. But as usual Q came up with another BS explanation and once again I couldn't reach him with sane arguments. I fought him a long time on this subject, tried to tell him that he needs to question his sources too, not just the main stream media. Last time he sent me a video from a parliament session in Denmark, were the prime Minister and the representatives were allegedly laughing uncontrollably about how they locked down the whole nation for no reason. Turns out the video was from October 2019 and they were discussing finding a retirement home for the last 4 circus elephants the state adobted after Denmark banned wild animals from circus shows.
It's really frustrating because there are  times where I'd really need him to just be my dad but instead he sends me articles and videos I can debunk with one Google search or just simple logic and calling me indirectly a sheep or a coward or blinded by the matrix.",QAnonCasualties

And how important people will be arrested for sex trafficking etc etc. He legit said I should make a bet with him about Trump taking over as president on March 4th...like whhhatt?? I asked where are you getting these sources, cause podcasts and youtube and facebook are not credible sources.. he says from former military people he trusts since he was in the military! THE LIST GOES ON... vaccines are killing people, the corona is nothing more than the flu, masks are useless and a scam to get us all to conform and biden is not even the legitimate president etc etc you get the picture.

I just DON’T know how to respond anymore besides saying “okay” and “we’ll see” and he gets sooo heated to a point where he is yelling his opinions and thoughts and wow it is just sooo great that I am not the only one going through this bullshit.. He says I need to open my eyes and get educated.. I’m sorry I thought I was the one who has a Bachelor and Masters in Biomedical sciences?? Since this year we have been so divided.

92,how do i tell them that they're delusional,"My parents keep believing all of the nonsense they see on Facebook. Yet ironically enough, they label every mainstream media fake news, of course, except for Fox News. They are asian immigrants from Vietnam and grew up during the communist age, so because of what they've experienced through out their childhood, they're now paranoid and consider everything that's not aligned to their views ""communist"". I thought that after the inaugeration of Biden would this end but nope, somehow, the biased ""news"" (I use news in heavy quotation marks because if you could understand the language you'd be horrified to see how this would even slightly be considered journalism) that they listen to turned it into more fake news, continuing the Qanon bullshit. Their entire facebook wall is filled to the brim with absolute garbage and false news and I have no idea how to help them. At this point, it isn't even Qanon anymore, just generally false information. For example, a few weeks ago, they saw some ""news"" journalist speak about how Mcdonald's uses human meat in their burgers, which to the average person would be absolutely insane for a number of different factors, but they actually believed it. I tried pulling up MULTIPLE news sources that have debunked this claim, but they respond with ""fake news"" and shut me down.

How the hell do I get through to them?",QAnonCasualties
93,I am worried about my QAnon mom,"Obligatory disclaimer that I (M 19) am a long-time lurker and am posting on a throwaway.


Up until last year, my mom (F 40’s) identified as a democrat. When quarantine happened, she was terrified of our family getting getting the virus. She never left the house unless it was to get groceries, stocked up on hand sanitizer/hand wipes, always wore plastic gloves, and bought an unnecessary amount of (non-disposable) masks. Around this time, she started spending a lot of her free time on her phone. I didn’t know what she was doing until a while later.

One day, I got a Twitter notification that someone on my contact list just made an account. When I saw it was my mom, I checked her account out of curiosity. What I saw was worrying.

At first, it was mostly tweets about spirituality. Then it slowly turned into retweets from QAnon accounts, mostly about #savethechildren and how vaccines cause autism (for context, my younger brother and I are on the spectrum. My mom has always been a little weary of vaccines since my brother got diagnosed ). She never talked about this stuff in person so I didn’t bring it up to her.

Now it’s all she talks about. She talks about how celebrities like John Legend and Tom Hanks are Satanic baby-eating pedophiles, while she worships the ground Donald Trump walks on. For months, she’s been telling my dad and I that things are going to change, that all these celebrities are getting killed, arrested, resurrected (I am not kidding about this one) whether we decide to “keep drinking the kool-aid”. 

Two months ago her Twitter account got suspended. I thought this would help her in some way but it didn’t. Instead, this obsession of trying to prove everyone who was “against her” wrong got worse.

I am really worried about her. She had always struggled with her mental health for as long as I can remember but for the most part she was alright mentally and emotionally. That was until all of this started. She went through periods of not taking her medication, making her go through terrible withdrawals. She would snap at me if I didn’t “agree” with her, called me a sheep, that one day she’ll prove me wrong, and more. I don’t know what to do.",QAnonCasualties
94,What happened to my mom?,"Today I got the covid vaccine. It was a very simple process. I am 26 but considered an essential worker and could get the vaccine.

My mom drove me as do not have a car at the moment. Initially the nurses thought my mom, 67, was going to get the vaccine as she is the older one. My mom told the nurses she refuses to get it. She is a prime candidate and has asthma. She watched me get it and asked the nurse “Does the syringe have a microchip?” The nurse tells her no. I felt really embarrassed.

I told her later that I thought it was a stupid question. But she said she had read it on the internet. “They said the syringe would have a microchip.” I tried to do an exercise with her... Tried to make her think about what she was saying. 

“Who is they?”
 “From an article I read.” “Where is the article from.” “I don’t remember, it was on the internet.”

 “Well Moderna never said they would put chips in the vaccine, so whoever they is is wrong.”

“I didn’t say there would be microchips in the vaccine, I said in the syringe!”

“Why would they put a microchip in a syringe?”

“So they can track people!”

“But why would they want to track people?”

“So they can keep a record of how many people are using the vaccine and how they are doing.”

  “You sign paperwork when you are vaccinated which would log your vaccination, and clinical trials are done to see effects before vaccines are pushed to market. You have an iPhone, if someone wanted to track you they can just use your phone.”

“The clinical trials... they don’t know what happens in clinical trials .”

She ignores all the other points I made. She pulls up on her phone a product being sold online called a Microchip Injector. “See, I told you they have them.”

“What does that have to do with the Moderna vaccine?”

“They said that they *could* have them in syringes.”

“Who is they? Its not the government, or Moderna, that said that, so who?”

“An article I read on Facebook.”

“So you got your news from Facebook?”

“No I don’t get my news from Facebook! But they said...”

And back and forth like this, where my Mom never questions her sources, or the absurdity of the conspiracy when taken to the logical conclusions.

My mom has slowly sunk into this hole where all she does is watch YouTube videos and sink into conspiracy theories. Some of them are Q lite stuff,  where she is spouting anti-Semitic stuff despite never having said anti-Semitic stuff in life before. Today is yet another stark reminder that my mom seems impossible to get through to, and even when given information on a topic, doesn’t seem to have the ability to understand the information... its scary because I don’t think she can help it. She’s not malicious, just incredibly naive.",QAnonCasualties
95,Q-think has been around for a long time by different names,"I've been reading a lot of these ""Q ate my family"" posts and my heart breaks for all of you.  I've been through a similar experience, but I left home before could bring my family back to sanity.

For context, I spent my junior/high school years living in the South in a three-generation family.  My grandfather got involved in a group that was at the time the religious arm of the alt-right.  Soon it encompassed our whole life - homeschooling because schools were indoctrination centers, new ""church"" because you can't believe what traditional preachers say, only ""natural medicine"" because ""doctors don't know anything and vaccines are poison""..... basically distrust of anyone not in our group. Violently racist because ""even the poorest white man is better than any \[insert slur here\]"".  

Additionally, they were heavily armed and believed the government would come at any time and take them to prison or kill them. When I was 16, my grandfather very carefully explained how, if the FBI came to the house and he was killed in the shoot-out, I was to bury him in the back 40 so no one would know he was dead and my grandmother could continue to collect his Social Security.  Funny thing is, the FBI did show up at their house once, but that's a whole 'nothing story.

So when I listen to what QAnon is preaching and how it takes over a person's life, I recognize it for the cult it is, and know how hard it is to leave.  The person would have to admit they were lied to, and then give up most of their social/online life.  What do you do when nearly everyone you know is in the same cult, especially when most of your human contact is online since one of the hallmarks of QAnon is throwing away any person who isn't a believer?

98,QAnon Personality types,"I'm noticing commonalities across Qultists' personalities and social standing and thought I'd open it up for discussion to sort of profile the types that fall for baseless conspiracies.

I see a lot of people playing the aggrieved victim-blamer card, over and over. In fact, it is captured well in this article about the QAnon Shaman who now abdicates all personal responsibility for his actions in the Capitol riots and blames Trump for ""grooming"" him ([https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-shaman-whines-that-trump-groomed-him-and-millions-of-other-americans](https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-shaman-whines-that-trump-groomed-him-and-millions-of-other-americans)).

I also notice other people who, aside from their victim-blamer mentality, also feel a deep sense of entitlement for things that they have not worked to earn. For example, they didn't go to college and have no skills but they slam academics and think they should be earning as much as, say, the IT person with a masters and relevant marketable skills. 

Loneliness and a deep desire to ""belong."" I suppose after years of living a ground hog day existence, QAnon offered them a ticket out of the tedium and boredom of daily living.

I’m a high school student with enough stress put on me, but having parents heavily involved in Q-Anon is putting more stress onto me than needed. My mother is split into two personas: one that’s my actual mom, and one that’s a cult member. It’s as if she turns into Batman once the night comes, and she starts on her Q binge series throughout the night. I’ve been mentally tired of this since early September 2020, which was when my parents first started going into this.

Yes, I understand that it could have been totally random but at the time, I was in such extreme emotional distress that I literally told my husband that I hope we don't lose the baby due to it a week before it happened.

My parents at this point are ""the 10 days of darkness was actually our consciousness going from 4D to 5D"" despite them getting supplies and literally taking cash out in preparation. They believe all he bad juju before the election happened and my miscarriage and the arguing within family was the transition toward a higher consciousness. Now that I'm not pregnant and there's little pressure on them to be covid safe, they think that everything is better. No the issues remain, I just an no longer high risk. 

I thought my brother at least would be reasonable.

( I already lost a brother to suicide) But I am becoming so sad and angry at her. I don’t know what to do. My fiancé thinks I’m over reacting to her.

111,"Getting my Vaccine Monday and Q thinks I will die in 3-6 months. But, the most disturbing part is...","That he literally thinks I'm going to die in 3-6 months after getting the vaccine and he doesn't even care to tell me that he loves me or that he will miss me when I'm gone. Like me dying from the vaccine is a real reality for him. I'm going to die. Period. But crickets from him. When you have a loved one who is going to be dead in 3-6 months, people tend to reach out, even if they are not on the best of terms, to offer support. Death can bring people together in weird ways. You normally have to be on really really bad terms (borderline traumatic terms) to not reach out when someone is dying. 

He literally thinks I have a year tops to live (3-6 months after the completed vaccine) and he is just ignoring me. This makes me wonder if my brother is a psychopath or something.

To have this feeling that your own brother doesn't care if you live or die is just heartbreaking.",QAnonCasualties

113,"I asked my friend to show me his ""proof that Q is real"" and this is what he sent me...","I have been hopelessly dead locked in a debate with my (former) best friend over ""whether or not Q is real"" for the last several months.  

In our most recent discussions, ""real"" seems to center around his firm belief that Q is some kind of divine being with knowledge of the future.

Most of the people in his life have distanced themselves from his ever increasing crazy, but I have been reluctant to do so myself.  I think I might be literally the last sane person that will engage in conversation with him, and I feel a kind of moral responsibility to do so.  I try to be respectful, and I know he appreciates it, even though he tells me that the dems (such as myself) are going to be rounded up and slaughtered in the near future...

He talks about these mountains of evidence (""bread"") showing that ""the plan is real,"" and I have been getting him to show me, which he is all to happy to do. 

Here is one of many images he's sent to me that he calls ""bread""

Seriously though, what the %#&amp;@?   This dude is (was) a smart guy.  He went to a good college, works a nice IT job, by all outside rating factors, he would seem to have it together.... but he's also a full blown Q adherent at this point.  He would literally do ANYTHING for this movement, and that scares me. 

I think it's time for me to join the others in his life that have abandoned him, for my own sanity.  Today we argued for an hour on discord about whether or not the image he emailed me qualified as proof... he thinks it does. 

Really, he thinks that this qualifies as proof that Q is real.... wtf? 

And yes, i pointed out the ifunny logo at the bottom, didn't seem to phase him at all.... Is all hope lost?  I feel like it is, and it's just....sad",QAnonCasualties

115,My (15M) brother (18M) has become increasingly more right-wing since the beginning of COVID and it’s scary.,"He’s always been a bit conservative (and a bit of a dick lmao) but the past few weeks have just been him parroting every conservative conspiracy you’d see on Fox. He tried to argue that the windmills caused the Texas black out, and when my dad and I said “clearly they didn’t, there’s windmills in Canada dude” he just wouldn’t change his mind. He’s like that a lot. He’ll say something boldly wrong, we’ll counter his points, and he’ll just stumble over his words and say “well I see what you mean” and then leave the room. 

The most frustrating thing right now is him with COVID. 

For backstory, my dad is 63. He has lung issues, heart issues, is overweight, and is just generally very high risk. He’s the only parent we have, and my best friend. 

My dipshit brother now goes off about how “masks don’t work because counties without mask mandates have the lowest cases” and that Fauci is lying or not to be trusted,  and he keeps on saying how the vaccines were made “too fast” (it would be a valid fear if I didn’t know he only thought that cause of false information). 

He’s constantly eating out at restaurants and going to public places to hang out despite us asking him not to. He works at a Valet place and I think it’s great that he’s working to support us and he always wears a mask there, but I just wish he’d stay home after. 

The most infuriating thing was yesterday when he started talking about how COVID wasn’t really a risk anymore cause numbers are going down, and he’s “been going out all the time and hasn’t gotten it yet.” When my dad said that it’s likely cause he was wearing a mask he just said “well I clearly don’t wear them at restaurants lol.” 

He then said “well we’re all going to get it anyways” which made me want to cry because my dad is likely to fucking die if he gets it and my brother just doesn’t care. My dad and I are both clearly upset by it but my dad is really sweet and just keeps saying that he can’t control my brothers opinions. 

He’s welcome to have his stupid opinions, but when he’s putting us all at risk that’s when the line should be drawn. Be mad all you want, but just put your mask on and wash your hands and stop being a giant baby. 

He also wants to be a cop and I’m fucking terrified. I just know he’s the type of man to abuse his power. I’m already scared of him most of the time. Any disagreement can turn into a heated argument and it hurts my dad whenever we fight, so I just leave the room or be silent whenever he’s around. He’s borderline abusive to his girlfriend (I’m not around the two of them enough to know the full story, but she’s complained to me before about him giving her the “silent treatment” and similar things). We were both abused by our mom as a kid and I know this plays into it but he refuses to get help (he thinks mental illness is fake and psychiatry is a scam.). 

He’s also just fucking racist. Coming home from work talking about the “loud/obnoxious black people” he had to deal with, or the “immigrants that could barely speak English”. 

There’s nothing I can do and I’ve just accepted that I won’t have a relationship with him once he moves out, but it’s sucks. I’m an awful sibling too and I know he has reason to dislike me, I just wish it was left with personal disputes and not political bullshit that drives us apart.

117,My family is gone,"I apologize if this is very rambling like. but this is heartbreaking. I am a high schooler just trying to have someone hear my cry for help.

Everyone in my house has different political ideas. My mom is a former republican who’s now a right leaning centrist. My dad is a liberal, and my grandma is almost out of her “this post on Facebook said..” phase (marvelous process made by her though!! She currently is waiting to get her second dose of the vaccine)

My mom has constantly denounced conspiracy theories, spoke out against Trump many times. This has caused her to loose friendships, have people stop talking to her, and one even said “people in leadership roles shouldn’t be political” which led my mom to resigning from her job at a church. This church also has a far-right nationalist pastor who believes we aren’t going to be able to worship soon (because a catholic is going to take away Christians rights. Yeah, ok) I’ve hear people at that church say that BLM protesters deserve to get covid, covid deaths are fake, nobody has died, and all you can imagine. Now onto my family...

My extended family on my mother’s side is a different story. Most are very anti-government conspiracy theorist. I went to eat breakfast with my cousins about 2 weeks ago and what I heard made me want to cry. Two of my cousins said that Covid was planned by the Government (because all 195 countries decided it was a good idea to release a deadly disease that’s killed over millions? Okay...) and they truly believe in Pizza gate, 9/11 was planned, and that all Democrat ran cities are hell on earth. My great uncle even posted an article at the church I (formerly) went to saying our Mayor is a liberal and she wants to take our guns. Many of them don’t want to take the vaccine (because they believe a Facebook troll over scientists who’ve been doing their jobs for 20+ years) they listen to OANN, Fox, any new source that worships Trump as their savior. 

I also talked about how the world thinks we are insane (very understandable) after they saw the terrorist attack on the capitol. My cousin said “well they also saw BLM and antifa...” and it hit me. The capitol invasion is what they’ve wanted. All the clues have added up, saying they were going to buy AR-15s because “In Joe Biden’s America they’ll be taken away” Ever since then it’s been a constant struggle with them.
 
My dads parents are also going down the rabbit hole, they watch OANN, Fox, they think CNN is the devils way of speaking to America. My grandfather thought it was unfair because it wasn’t his age groups turn to get the vaccine (patience grandpa, patience) and it’s become very clear they can’t snap out of it.

I’ve always been told family first, and usually these things have never affected me in any bad way, I would just say “whatever” and go on. But after those past year watching our politics go in a wacky direction, I can’t look past my family and family friends believing these things. Am I the bad one for not wanting to be around them, possibly even cutting them off?",QAnonCasualties

She said they were talking about how President Biden is actually dead, his clone is running things and the reptilian shapeshifters are taking over. I just said well, it's QAnon crap and she, and I'm so jealous of this, didn't know what that was so I had to explain it.

120,A shabby-chic decor blog I used to love turned Qulty,"There was a time that my broke ass thought about living in a tiny house, and I like shabby-chic decorating.  I found a lady who had a tiny house built, and she decorated it so cutely.  She even had cute outbuildings done in the same manner.  Her holiday and seasonal decorating was adorable.  Those pics were so lovely.

Then she started posting a lot of stuff praising god and being anti-vax for her dogs, blaming vaccines for her beloved dog getting cancer.  I thought, ""OK, she's really hurting right now, and she has no SO or kids, and this is her way of coping,"" so I kept reading.

Then she moved from the PNW to the southeast.  She said that god led her there.  She bought a cute little house and started decorating that too.  But she spike so disparagingly about the west coast where she grew up, and it started seeping into all of her posts, as well as the religious stuff.  She didn't know anyone where she had bought her house, so that must have been very isolating for her.

Then Trump got elected, and things really started changing.  She started decorating alongside Trump signs, and verbally got into it with people who asked her to not be so in-your-face about it.  She changed her bio to be even nastier, telling people who were only there for home decorating to ""move along"", because her blog was a safe space for conservatives.  At this point, none of the home decorating blog posts were Trump or Q free, and for every 1 home decor post there was one about how she praises god for electing Trump and ""saving the country"".  I stopped regularly reading after that.  The last post is from January 3rd, praying that Pence wouldn't certify the election results because ""no one she knows voted for Biden,"" so she is sure the election was stolen.

Now, I didn't know this person personally, but her early posts helped me through a time when I was afraid of being homeless with my kid.  The pictures were so beautiful, and I still look at them from time to time.  But I'm a little sad at how far she has fallen.  She went from an earthy crunchy cool chick to a Qultist.  How many peopke have turned away from her business because of her rants and general disagreeable behavior?  How much more is she isolating herself?  It's so sad to see the downward spiral right there in print.",QAnonCasualties

122,I'm tired of being less important than Q.,"My parents are right wing (dad more so than mom) and so is my boyfriend. My boyfriend actually was semi-recently committed to a mental hospital because he is OBSESSED with Q.

I really need to end it with my boyfriend because Q is more important to him than I am (we've been together for almost 4 years).  He was normal before, albeit still very into politics, but it was normal. We could have normal conversations and I loved listening to him talk about his interests (he was trying to teach me about stocks before he was committed). Politics never mattered to our relationship, as we believe vastly different things. Towards the end, he couldn't sleep. He was obsessed with the pizzagate thing, and he kept talking to my mom about it. My mom didn't believe it (thank god) but she got him onto that belief that Trump is a time traveler that's come to save us and that the world is flat and all that jazz. I am so mad that she got that into his head, as he was already struggling. That's the part that really pushed him over the edge.

Supposedly he was following people and forcing them to listen to his Q rhetoric as he thought he was saving them. I know for certain he went MIA for a few days and then they found him in the streets, crying and covered in his own feces/vomit. It pains me to think of him like that, as he is normally such a strong person. He (like me) has some serious mental health conditions.

When he was in the hospital and we'd talk nearly everyday over the phone, he seemed normal. He told me he loved me for the first time in months, and I felt like he was getting better. He's been out for a while and he's been weaned off his meds and he's finally starting to feel more like himself again, but now he's on me because masks don't work and the pandemic is a hoax and whatnot.

He hasn't told me he's loved me since, and I am just very, very tired of him loving politics and Q more than he loves me. I want to break up with him, but I don't know how as I've never had to do so before and I still want him in my life because he's normally such a nice, sweet guy. If he could just give up Q, that would be good, but he's too far in. I don't really have hope for it.",QAnonCasualties

125,"Not sure my relationship with my anti-vax, girlfriend is worth saving anymore, seems she went of the deep end into Q territory","I've been with her close to 4 years. I found out she was anti-vax shortly into our relationship. At the time, I didn't think too much into it. I'm one who always believes it's her body, her choice when it comes to what she does to herself.  She has always been a heathy eater and earthy hippie type when it comes to diets, which I though was always a positive thing. About a year into our relationship she was diagnosed with lyme disease. After the diagnosis, she started getting into a bunch of pseudoscience healing, such as muscle testing,  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, rife machine frequency treatment, crystal healing and such. Bought dozens if not hundreds of natural supplements, bouncing around to 6 or 7 different doctors's some of them real, and some natural. Some of the real doctors didn't think she had lyme at all, but that is a discussion for a different day. I always supported her on her decision of treatment. Then covid hit and she started becoming even a little more extreme with her views. She started believing that masks do more harm than good. She believes now that Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci are evil and trying to decrease the population an whatnot. I feel that her facebook antivax groups were her gateway drug to looney tunes land.
 
Now the other night I brought up the fact that it looks like covid cases are going down. She blurted out ""yeah they won their election with this bullcrap, now let us get back to normal"". I was a little shocked. I was like, ""wait a minute, do you really belive that?"". She said, ""yep, covid is fake"". She's always despised trump during his presidency, so we had that in common. Latley, when she hears of someone getting  the vaccine, she goes into rants about how stupid they are for not doing their ""research"". Almost everything is now a conspiracy theory with her. She has even started to believe the government is controlling the weather and the recent cold wave was caused by them. She has become a very negative minded with just about everything lately. Any conversation is quickly flipped to something negative. It's gotten to the point that it's affecting my mental health. I just can't understand how she could become so brainwashed from random people she doesn't know on the internet, and take what they say as fact. She tells me I am the one who is brainwashed. I feel our relationship my be coming to an end very soon, and there isn't any way of saving it at this point.",QAnonCasualties
126,"Is It Your WHOLE Family, Too? Or Am I The Only One?","The only person I have in my life right now who doesn't buy into this Q stuff is my SO.  I'm starting to feel like our safety (just from Covid-paranoia and their Anti-Masking ways alone) is in question.  

My mother has used my mental health vulnerability against me before and she attempted to do so again in 2020.  I am just recently learning what a boundary is in my 30's.  Because I set a boundary, she started telling family I was ""losing my mind again.""  I'm literally just chillin, home-schoolin and having anxiety like the majority of the country- I'm not doing anything wrong or different except I am seeing a therapist and setting boundaries.  My weight- which has been the same exact weight for eight years sans the fluctuation from bloating- was suddenly being dragged into question.  If they can claim my disordered eating is flaring up again, then they can claim I'm getting ""crazy"" again.  This is starting to feel like some FreeBritney shit in my own life.  Except lucky me, I'm poor so nobody wants to use me for that lol.  My mother was infuriated I wouldn't open my door for her and then sent every other family member for me.  I had more invitations to outings and unannounced drop-bys by family members in 2020 than all other years of my adulthood combined.  I learned how to say no but I'm still not leveled up enough yet to not include reasons.  I was accused of ""isolating myself"" by every single family member.  In a global pandemic.  When we're supposed to be staying at home.  It's absurd but my sense of humor is drifting away from me, and I have to keep a strong connection to that because that has been a vehicle for my ability to remain calm and stable throughout this past year.  And I tell you what, when you're the ""crazy one"" of your family, watching your whole family Folie a'Deux in front of your eyes over a period of years.... Yeah I've had enough taking stress hormones because of them.  I have to get away from this because it is no joke, wrecking my body.  

I don't know how to do this.  My therapist even seems on the bandwagon as I've heard Antifa come out of his mouth at least thrice over the period of a year.  Apparently I live in a rural pocket of dysfunction and I have to lay low and strategically pull myself out of this situation.  I just need to get to vaccinations without catching the Rona.  I'm no longer worried about changing anyone's minds.  I'm about protecting my immediate family from this craziness.  Just yesterday, my mother was spouting bullshit about how we already caught Rona last year in this time (when I'd attempted my first boundary with her in asking she do not come to our house sick, she did anyway then went on to say we caught it, too.  We did not and we were not sick at all in 2020.) and when I said that immunities only last for 6 months, she called it all bullshit.  My grandmother, who will die a terrible drawn out death if she catches the Rona, is being cared for by my mother.  I have absorbed nothing but fucking Cortisol for the entirety of 2020 because of the fears I have of losing these people and also the fears I have of losing my own life or ability to walk or talk because they can't respect my wishes.  My doctor told me flat out not to catch Rona because I'm already having neuropathy symptoms (which are obvious to see) and we haven't figured out the root causes as to why.  I've explained this to everyone I know.  Mother, siblings, grandparent, uncles/aunts and cousins, too.  One would think that would lead to an understanding.  Of course not.  My life can never be just problem to solution then solved.  No wonder why I have crippling anxiety.  I'd have to be a psychopath to not be freaking out atm.

I'm so exhausted and I reached a breaking point last month where something got shut off in me.  I am no longer willing to help them, I'm no longer open to hearing their sob stories, I'm no longer able to share my life or struggles with them.  The only thing stopping me from changing my number and cutting them off completely are the younglings that are in tow and my urge to be the best influence to them I can muster.  


Please just could someone else- even if you have to lie, tell me I'm not the only one who's losing everyone they knew and loved to Q. 
 I don't think I can handle feeling this alone in the world today. 
 Thank you if you read this all.

Edit- Thank you for all of the support and I will be meeting with my therapist within the week and moving on.  Someone gave me great advice of taking seven different people's input on any one given subject and I love that and will be taking that with me wherever I go.

She is someone who is curious about Q and I'm terrified she will fall further into it. She believes that BLM is connected to a global communist and islamic cabal funded by China, last summer was really my breaking point. I kept seeing all the police brutality that was so open and shameless and it bothered me alot and i visably mourned it. She constantly belittled and insulted me for questioning law enforcement and we got into plenty of yelling matches over whether the victims of police brutality ""deserved"" it or not.  For some context I'm a nearly 17 yo transgender girl and they have known for nearly 3 years now. They are incredibly antilgbt going along with all the boycotts and such. I'm so sick of the podcasts and fox news and oan blaring constantly. Hearing all those horrid things spouted out is hurtful and knowing my own mother subscribes to it hurts more. It is a constant struggle to live here and I hope I can get out soon because I feel like my mental health is getting worse the longer I stay here.

129,My Qmom is now anti-vax,"Just when I think things couldn't get any worse my Qmom ended up ranting about how none of my family is going to get any of the vaccines because they have not been tested and how they contain baby fetuses and aluminum, she also did the typical ""do your research, I did mine"" quote so I think I've hit some kind of fucked up bingo by this point.

I am high risk and she is super high risk so getting a vaccine is not just a so I don't feel really bad for a while because I'm in the demographic of people who could likely die from it from what I understand. This has gone from sad to pathetic to outright endangering my life.

I'm only 17 so I can't go and get one by my self yet but I told her in 4 months once I turn 18 I am getting it. Then comes the typical arguments about how ""no your not its not safe"" and ""I'm only doing this to protect you""

The past six months have been a living hell to go through with my mom. She has a lot of bad medical issues she has been a bit or an odd ball but I never thought it would be conspiracy theorist then and anti Vax and every day it seems like their are new even more dangerous than the last things she believes. 

Meanwhile I'm terrified that she is going to have a second cardiac arrest and drop dead, the only reason she survived the first one was because I happen to be in the house in the other room, I even watched her die and be revived by paramedics. So I've got trauma, and paranoia to leave her alone all while having to deal with her loosing her mind more and more every day.

Im sorry for the rant I just really needed a place to vent.

Edit: things just got worse My mom called me into the living room to argue with me about how Bill gates, Anthony Faucci and George Sorrose created the covid virus in order to make money off the vaccine while depopulating the planet.

137,I Lost My Dad to Conspiracy Theories,"I don't use reddit much, but I heard of this subreddit and figured it may be a good outlet for me. Bear with me, this is gonna be kind of a rambly post with no real resolution. I just want to share my story.

For as long as I can remember, my dad has bought into conspiracy theories. He's a recovering addict (who doesn't believe in addiction) and he's on narcotics due to a back injury he sustained. His delusions somehow were exacerbated by this injury, he totally changed after it.

It started out kind of small and standard, when I was in elementary school he would warn me about the illuminati and make me watch bizarre youtube videos. That was tolerable, though. He was still a good dad. We would go out rock hunting in the Owyhees, or practice shooting together. On clear nights we'd star gaze and he'd point out constellations and planets, talk about the basic science behind them. It was silly, but at the time these bonding experiences with my father made me believe I could work at NASA. It was a childhood dream of mine.

When I hit 12, I started forming my own opinions, and unfortunately it caused issues. He became distant, but not outlandish. No, it wasn't until a few years later, 2016, that his mental stability seemed to totally collapse.

He started off by becoming a Flat Earther. My friends find it real funny, but it's honestly extremely sad. I'd try to get him to come look at the moon and stars with me and it would end with him screaming in my face about how none of it was real, and I was stupid for even thinking it was. He became a massive Trump supporter, essentially believed he was the messiah, and my father just dissolved into this hateful, bigotted, fearful shell of the man I used to know. 

He started to believe the military was going to storm the house and take his guns, he was constantly on edge about what big secrets the government was hiding, he was just sure Trump would bust that deep state pedo ring, other outlandish and bizarre stuff. He started watching alt-right youtubers and began mimicking their sentiments about the LGBTQ community being evil and unnatural and undeserving of life. I am a closeted transman and I know I can never come out for fear of my own safety. I'm scared of what my dad would do.

We don't rock hunt or star gaze anymore. The closest thing I can get to that is agreeing to help him pick up brass to reload for the impending apocalypse. Other than that, he takes off on his motorcycle for days at a time or just ignores his family. We stay quiet because we're scared of his delusion-filled blowups.

138,Going Through Life As a University Student With a QAnon Mother,"Hi everyone, I'm only just recently finding these kind of recovery groups but I'm so glad I have. QAnon has taken over my mother's life and driven her to the point of being committed to a mental institution twice in less than a month. This has left me as basically the head of household for a house that I don't even live in and am 100+ miles away from. I've had to take in 3 cats, worry about bills being paid on the house and my 3 dogs that were taken to the pound following my mother's committal, plus the well-being and safety of my 14 year old sister who was made to move in with my father following an incident with my mother that made her get committed the first time, all on top of me being a double major in music and political science and taking 20 credit hours this semester. I'm trying my best to keep my head above water, but it's so hard when I don't even recognize my own mother anymore. She's diagnosed with manic bipolar depression, but QAnon has led her to believe that she no longer needs her medicine, causing her to lash out at others, specifically my sister. She's still in the hospital as we speak with no signs of improvement. My mom has been my best friend for so long and I miss her so much. It feels like I've not been able to have a normal conversation with her in over three months now. I just want my old mom back. I can't even watch my Snapchat memories anymore because there are so many videos of her and watching them just makes my heart hurt more. And I feel so terrible for my sister who is caught up in all of this as well. She's starting her freshman year of high school and has to do so completely remotely and from over sixty miles away because she's with my dad, who neither of us have a good relationship with anyway. It feels like I'm in a never-ending cycle of stress. I want to go home to visit my family like an normal college kid, but I can't because there's no one home anymore. I can't discuss this with anyone at school either because this is a pretty left-leaning institution and I feel like I won't be taken seriously if I do try to talk to any of my political science professors and address it as a valid concern.",QAnonCasualties

142,"My mother is ""widowed"", again.","I had a horrible feeling that I'd be posting on here eventually- and here we are! It's tragic to read the posts on here- it is a small comfort to know I'm not the only one who lost a loved one to a conspiracy about blood-drinking, child-trafficking lizard people.

My mother and her partner had been together since 2007- they met serendipitously after my dad passed. It was a pretty happy relationship for a long time; he was a pretty great dude, funny, and did wonders for my mom keeping up with the house and generally keeping her company. They decided to never marry (having both been married once before), but I felt that he really became part of our family, and he really cared for my sister and I. I moved away from my hometown for work, but felt better leaving knowing she had his companionship. It wasn't a seamless relationship, but it seemed to be what they both needed. At least for awhile.

The drifting apart was insidious at first. He spent gradually more and more time with his friends, and more and more time online. My mom's pretty liberal and he *was* apolitical. Rarely voted, stated he didn't give a shit about politics. But I think he spent too many hours with his really sketchy, racist, generally unpleasant friends, and got caught up. He actually tried to hide his Q browsing for awhile from my mom, knowing she would call him out on it, until he started showing her REALLY bizzare ""information"" and ""YouTube Truths"".

The family really imploded during quarantine. I did my best to give my love and support from afar and tried as hard as I could to play peacekeeper. The election was a big flashpoint for their relationship; LOTS of arguments about politics, and his friends even threatened my mom at times in her own home. My mom thought he'd chill the fuck out afterwards, but he just dove deeper and OBSESSED over the election, the ""cabal"", Bill Gates, all sort of ridiculous nonsense.... And he didn't even vote in the election!

A part of me is a little relieved my mom is out of a relationship she had grown really unhappy with- and I think she's safer away from his friends- but it's truly heartbreaking to see her experience this loss (and not be able to travel to at least give her a hug)...

I'm still Facebook friends with him (albeit I'm not on as much these days). He constantly shares garbage misinformation, particularly with respect to the pandemic, vaccines, and severity of coronavirus.. for me, that's the deepest cut. He would rather believe information from randos and memes on facebook than me............ and I'M A GODDAMN MD.

Thanks for reading and acting as a conduit for my  internet venting. If my sister stumbles across  this: don't show mom (miss you guys a fuckton, even that asshole rooster).",QAnonCasualties
143,Mom just met her heroes- Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell 🤦🏻‍♀️,"My mom is a Q freak- has been for years. She always talks about how I’m “asleep” and is trying to “wake {me} up.” Over the years, we have just had to agree to disagree and stop conversations when they start getting heated because we cannot coexist in a room much less on this planet if she brings her conspiracy theory bull shit into the conversations. Our conversations over the years have often ended in yelling, crying, screaming, or fleeing from the scene altogether because of QAnon so she’s learning to shut her mouth. 

Stuff inevitably still comes up now and then, but we try to nip it in the bud when it does. Today, she calls me freaking out about how she met her “heroes” Sidney Powell (Trumpie lawyer) and Michael Flynn (Former very much failed US National Security Advisor). She said she asked them about if the child pedophilia is really as bad as she thinks it is, and they said, “even worse.” She talked to them for 10 minutes, and essentially, I’m so worried the pushed her so much further back into her culty ways and that things are about to get worse. 

I honestly didn’t know how to react to her and just said, “glad you’re happy”, and other general BS like that to avoid arguing, but, truthfully, I’m so scared that she will regress even more and just be more validated over her conversations with them. Pray (to the universe, to whatever you believe in, and not even in a religious way) for me to get through this. Ugh.",QAnonCasualties

We hadn't spoken in a few months, so I brought up how freaked out I was about the Capitol riot. He downplayed it, and said he had read things online that made him doubt what really happened.

First he said that simple protestors couldn't have broken the ""bulletproof"" glass windows of the Capitol, implying the photos clearly showing protestors breaking windows were fake somehow. 

Quick aside, they are not and never were bulletproof.

The second thing he claimed was that a lot of the rioters photographed in the Capitol doing destructive things had hammer and sickle tattoos. When I told him I highly doubted the far right guys would have Communist tats, he said, ""Well, that's the point. Then they were on the other side."" 

You know, because a whole bunch of Communist agent provocateurs who are trying to frame the right all tattoo their allegiance in easily visible places and forget to cover it up.

I changed the subject after he told me it was just stuff he read and I should look it up myself. Looking it up myself showed me both these insane ideas are being promulgated by the conspiracy theory crowd.

I have friends and family members that have gotten into all this, but I don't know if their experiences are shared by others (although of course everyone is unique in some way).

What I've seen with my friends/family:

\- They have always tended to believe that there are evil, left-wing elites out to get us. QAnon gave them an outlet for this belief and fanned it even more.

\- They trusted someone (a friend, authority figure \*cough cough\*) who believed, and this pulled them in as well.

150,Next week? Any word on real actions?,"like many of you, I have heard all the theories about March 4th. Trump is coming back, rounding up the pedophiles, military take over, the Storm, civil war, etc etc.  However, has anyone heard of any actual plans? Jan 6 th, Trump used Twitter to bring people out for his rally and it went from there. There was something put out beyond Qanon message boards.

But March 4th? While the police in Washington DC are preparing for the worst, other than rumors and stories Qcumbers tell each other, is there any planned gathering or protest? I have not heard anything on those lines. At least not in the capital. My state capital has a protest most weekends, so something at our capital on the 4th is probably already scheduled. Probably a protest protecting squirrels or a protest march against the governor for his bad haircut. But I don't live in a red Trump is the Savior state. 

If this weekend at his speech Trump says or suggests something, well that is possible. But Trump isn't Q. They may worship him, but he uses them like a disposal wipe. It just seems there should be some hard plans if they actually are going to do something. Unless trump is suppose to do it all himself",QAnonCasualties

155,Q drops versus the Q drips,"So this whole Qanon thing has cost me the friendship of a couple that I've known as friends since 2011 or so, a good ten years. Great people, lots of fun, professionals, etc. Never any heated political discussions. I am fairly middle politically and would consider him just a little right of center for all the years I have known him.

What I call the Q Drip, began over the last year, when political things were dropped into normal everyday situations for absolutely no reason.

Things like, "" If Biden gets elected he'll appoint all Blacks to his Cabinet."" Heard this the first time and said "" What'd you just say? He repeats it and says this will happen and we will be a socialist/marxist country. I'm like why would you say that? No reasonable answer, just a wait you'll see. Obviously doesn't come true, utter nonsense. We were riding bikes and out for ice cream as couples at the time on a gorgeous summer day. WTF.

Months before that he meets some other friends of mine for the first time in March of 2020 and goes on a rant about how the coronavirus is just the flu, it's all made up by the democrats to oust Trump, etc, etc, etc. Very embarrassing for me. Never heard this shit before from him.  I'm like you just met these people, maybe get to know them, ask some questions about them, etc. I get him data on flu deaths verus coronavirus deaths and all the bullshit arguments begin. He's not scared of it, blah, blah, blah. It's inflated to turn us into drones.

Then we get together for my birthday one night in late August with them and another couple, drinks, nice outdoor fire, etc. Good social distance and everything. I'm thinking we'll have a nice time together. Within 5 minutes it turns into a Covid bitchfest. The governor is an ass, this college closed, that high school shut down, with of course nonstop criticism of every organizational body that has to deal with the virus. Non stop criticism. Again I'm like WTF and what would you do smartypants?!?! No answers of course.

The night devolves into more full on Qanon comments and perspective. The coronavirus will go away the day after the election, just you wait and see. I'm like so people across a country are going to fill in ballots, vote, the ballots will be counted and this will make a virus that has penetrated the WORLD population go away? The virus is in other countries too did you know that? Doesn't matter what I say, as logical as I am it makes no dent. A made up virus by the Democrats to get rid of Trump, you just wait and see. ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED.

This turns into more stuff like hydroxychloroquine, BIG PHARMA doesn't want it to work because they won't make any money. I say, ""So all the doctors and hospitals have to be in on it too to then because they want to make more money? You don't think there are any doctors out there who care about the health and safety of their patients?"" If it worked I'm sure we all would be relieved and happy. But it doesn't. Well of course all the doctors and hospitals are in on it too.

There is more of course that night, the pedophile democrats, fake hospital deaths, masks are the worst infringement on our personal freedoms,, the Deep State, etc. This being uttered all the time. I finally GO OFF. Known them over 10 years, never done anything like it and I let them HAVE IT. Felt good and felt bad all at the same time.

It is now 6 months later and we haven't spoken. Found a text from his wife to my wife talking about the 1619 project and how that is destroying our schools across the USA. They haven't changed and aren't going to anytime soon. Think I just need to let them go.

The Q drip is a common tactic  that many of us have experienced and I said/yelled/screamed  ""You are not doing this to me anymore!""

Does it matter? Will they change? I don't know. But I was not going to be the nice guy and ease them back. I said enough is enough. I feel horrible about it, but I just want sane, rational, clear thinking people in my life who are willing to look at something, break it down and examine what is really happening. Then look to empirical evidence for support. Is that too much to ask?",QAnonCasualties

I told him that it was the last straw and I didn't want his negativity, racism and violent statements about women in my life anymore and cut off contact. It was like a teenage breakup. He threw some fishing rods I had at his house in his front yard and told me to pick them up or they would be stolen. He has been a friend since seventh grade (we are 43yo) and each time a democrat is elected to office he stops talking to me for at least a year or two. The ups and downs have me worn out. He lashed out at me following Biden's election, the certification in congress and then again at the inauguration. I am exhausted by the whole thing.

I saw a gentile, kind, loving man become hateful, violent, and unavailable unless I believed what was discussed on the show. I equated it to him becoming someone that plays violent video games. I had to move out of our home about 2 weeks after he pushed me to the ground twice. Our house was filled with the repeated playing of the THI podcasts. Our relationship ended forever after he physically beat me when I felt he was not listening to my concerns. He has taken a plea in his DV charge. I have reached out the Thomas Williams that runs the show and his responses have been less than hopeful. My Ex had been in a cult before which I felt made him a good candidate for believing in Q info. He was always someone that looked at alternative information and for a long time practiced yoga, meditation, and looks at more positive groups looking at the good of all people and how to be a good person. The day he started listening to the THI show is the day our relationship changed. I lost someone I saw myself getting old with. This is some scary stuff and I’m so happy this group is here.

I've been fighting against qanon since I learned about them during ##SAVEOURCHILDREN. Qanon decided to use the suffering of children to recruit new victims. This movement claimed to be the voices of silenced children...like me. Qanon is not my voice.
 Qanon spread false conspiracy theories about child sex trafficking that distracts from actual child sex trafficking. They also claimed that trump was going to save us all from the evil democrat lizard pedophiles....when in reality trump has Epstein accusations. He was accused of sodomizing a 12 and 13yo at an epstien party in 1994. There were 2 witnesses and the 12year old was proven kidnapped...not only that but even Maxwell herself was recently quoted mentioning videos of both Clinton and Trump with girls. So  qanon spread a movement that pushes a suspected Epstein pedophile as a hero, while silencing the stories of Epstein victims. The silencing of victims being disguised as the voices of victims is certainly triggering to me. I was mentioned in a news article  after my outcries over qanon caught the attention of a journalist.

Sure we've had our differences but it's nothing we haven't been able to reconcile about.  At certain points of my life I would probably call him my best friend.

But recently that relationship has been upended by Q. I first got a glimpse when Trump came down those golden escalators and started spewing hateful things about Mexicans. My parents lapped it up, and that's because spoiler alert: we're Mexican! It was all downhill after that. Hilary this, Comey that, Obama yadda yadda. Trump getting elected is what made me start paying attention to politics and now I try to volunteer where I can.

Things we're OK between us during the Trump admin, but things really ramped up after the election. Voter Fraud, Military Take Over, The Storm, Blah Blah. Honestly I was pretty frazzled by this point. During this time I tried avoiding divisive topics (which just seems to keep expanding) but somehow we still circle back to Trump or Biden. 

I look at my dad today and I hardly recognize him, he is just so hateful now. He calls me a socialist and says I hate Trump and think all Trump supporters are racists.

I’ve tried just about everything with her: intently listening and asking questions without judgement, trying to argue against her points with facts (such as “Biden is the president”), have tried to help get her a job or a hobby actually helping children/volunteering (she quit working before becoming a Qpatriot) and even tried to set boundaries to say that I do not want to talk about anything Q related.

She has also sucked my sister into it, but she’s more on the fringes: doesn’t believe in the vaccine but does believe in healing crystals (also, she’s an elementary school teacher.. so that’s great.) my dad isn’t quite as sucked in but he still thinks libs and antifa are the enemy and Trump was a great president.

two of my friends are incredibly intelligent doctoral candidates. they're kind, caring, and some of the smartest people i know. at least they were, i guess. at the beginning of trump's presidential run they insisted that even though they both are republicans, they weren't going to vote for him and that they didn't agree with him on a lot of policies. over time, they've both turned into something that i don't recognize. every time i try and talk to them, it somehow comes back to Q. it's absolute lunacy. they're insistent that I'm part of the enemy because i voted democrat, that a second civil war will break out, that i should be arming myself for when antifa will raid our republican-controlled city and round everyone who voted red up and deport them. my female friend is stockpiling canned food, shelf milk, bottled water, and other non-perishable items for when this antifa raid happens and she needs to hide from them, enough to last her for a few months. apparently, the trump followers and Q believers will be rounded up and shipped to concentration camps. my male friend is thoroughly convinced that every single American who voted in the election actually voted for trump, but dominion voting along with the ""deep state"" changed the 81 million votes biden won. he claims that i made hundreds of copies of my ballot and sent those in with dead peoples' names attached instead of mine. he calls Q drops and the videos from top Q believers on youtube the ""new Bible"" and tells me to throw my copies of the ""old"" one away. they both watched the insurrection on the capital like it was the stanley cup final. I've tried to reason with both of them, show them that none of this is true, but they won't believe me. it's gotten to the point that they won't even let me over for dinner and don't want to see me anymore because they don't want to associate with the enemy. 

i feel like I'm grieving the people i knew the same way i would be if they had died. this is incredibly painful, and nothing I'm doing seems to be working. i don't have many friends, and i have no family closeby. I'm worried that what other few friends i have are also wrapped up in this insanity and i don't know it yet. i don't want to be alone, but i can't let this continue on any longer.",QAnonCasualties

174,I’m losing my family.,"My Dad has never explicitly stated he believes in all the Q junk, but his views are strongly aligned with them. 

When I was a kid, my father was a scumbag, but he did a really good job of hiding it. I wholly believed he was a good person, and my ever-patient mother was kind enough to not burst my bubble until I was about 13, when he started to show his true colors.

It started with the 2016 election, but even then I was too brainwashed to understand the flaws in his thinking. I had been told that if Clinton was elected President, the world would end—and I believed all of it, ever bit of conservative propaganda I was fed from toddlerhood onwards. It wasn’t until I got to high school and met some really positive, wonderful people that I realized that not everything was doom and gloom. Not everything had to do with politics and the liberals weren’t out to string us by our toes.

This was also about the same time I discovered I was gay. I was really afraid to come out to my dad, who I had figured out was an insane conspiracy theorist by that time, but I hoped he would still be proud of me. After all, I was still the same person. I was still his little girl.

Evidently not.

His tirades had no end. He believed that I was “too far gone” and that my “liberal school” had converted me. He pulled my little sister out of her own school and put her in a christian online school called Freedom Academy. I could tell that I was starting to loose her, and we argued so often we were barely on speaking terms. I couldn’t take the mental abuse anymore, so I left. I’m glad that I did, but it seems that quarantine has made his attitude so, so much worse.

I’m writing this because I called him the other day, trying to get an update on my twin sisters that were born last October. He gave me two seconds of peace, and I honestly believed he wasn’t going to talk about it, before he started to argue with me about the pandemic again, calling face masks “scare tactics” and the quarantine organized “so the liberals could kick Trump out of office” because OBVIOUSLY he’s the best President we’ve ever had. 

He was angry at why I hadn’t already come out to visit him, even though none of them take precautions and I don’t feel like endangering my new family with COVID. He started accusing me of not loving my family, of being selfish and psycho because I didn’t agree with him and his batshit, deep state views.

I’m so tired, I don’t know what to do. I want to go see him this summer, if only to meet my new sisters, but I’m at a loss. He’s always been very persuasive and manipulative so I’m worried that if I go he might hold my siblings over my head and force me to stay. Cutting him off isn’t an option, either, because I’d lose all contact with my siblings and extended family.

(My parents are divorced, and I live with my mom as of currently. I lived with my dad up until June 2020).

TLDR; Shitty Q dad wants me to come see him. Need advice.",QAnonCasualties
175,Lost my Brother and Dad,"I have always had a strained relationship with my Brother and Dad my whole life and I’m in my mid 40’s.  Things took a turn when my Mum died in 2016 and then the Trump and Q rhetoric heated up in 2017.  Things got really bad. 

It got to the point where I couldn’t have a discussion with them, because it devolved into politics so they could inform me about being fed lies by fake news, pedo socialists and commies.  They are consuming right wing media all the time.  I was told Trump was a good man.  Trump didn’t lose the election, “you’ll see”, which i will assume was referring to the failed coup.

The straw that broke the camel’s back was when I sent a link to my father that seemed logical and had succinct arguments and accurate evidence which I thought give him for for thought.  He replied with “CNN is crying” and other nonsense.  What I sent him wasn’t even related to CNN, but that was his go to.  I called him and said “quick call, you send me nothing, I’ll send you nothing.  You don’t call me and I won’t call you”.  

Here’s the kicker, we all live in Canada.",QAnonCasualties
176,A Powerful Argument Against Q (and all other conspiracy theories),"Because of the cult-like grip Q has on people you cannot talk them out of it directly.  You have to plant seeds of doubt and hope they take root and grow.  I recently learned about one of these seeds.  It is about the moon landing, but you can pivot it to Q.

Based upon the actual footage documenting the moon landing it is estimated that 400,000 people would have to be colluding on the conspiracy.  NONE of these alleged co-conspirators came forward since.  That is completely unrealistic.  We all know how hard it is for any group to keep anything secret for long, to have so many non-military personnel and corporations participating it would be absolutely impossible.

So, how many people would have to collude in a Q-like set of conspiracies?  Because it is not just one conspiracy, but several (election fraud, baby-eating, vaccinations, etc), a huge number of people would have to be involved.

Example: so where are the parents of ANY child that was supposedly stolen and eaten?  Why didn’t the parents file a missing child report?  Why didn’t the school?  Grandparents?  Immediate family?  

To believe Q you are assuming that parents and immediate family, police, child services, missing child CHARITIES, religious organizations who help children, services people who would be responsible for preparing the dead children to be eaten (because the rich don’t cook for themselves), and more would have to be actively complicit in keeping this secret IN ADDITION to the government.  This would be thousands of thousands of people worldwide in addition to the rich people running it all.

This argument is given strength by stating that people cannot even plan a surprise party easily.  Humans are not good at keeping secrets.

Try to add this to the arsenal of truths that you can use.  I hope it helps.",QAnonCasualties
177,Had a HUGE fight with my sister yesterday,"My sister, who has been poking and poking me, trying to get a reaction, but I've been holding back. I finally couldn't stand it when, yesterday, she texted me some of her ""data"" and started going on about all the evidence of thousands of deaths and permenant injury people are experiencing from taking the Covid vaccine.

I blew up and answered her sharply. It went back and forth. She had the nerve to tell me that she was telling me all this in order to be able to say I told you so after I get my vaccine and, probably, die.

I told her I'm done and took myself off of our family group chat.

She promptly texted me privately and called me a typical Democrat who can't have an argument with the facts (I'm a Republican, as she knows). Then she called me a hypocrite.

I sent her a long voice note with barely restrained anger, telling her that the issues isn't whether she or I are correct about the vaccine. It's about her disrespect and overstepping boundaries by not allowing me to have my own opinions.

She had the gall to say this was all about her being concerned for me and how much she loves me and doesn't want to lose me, blah, blah, vomit.

When I calmed down later, I was able to think more clearly. I knew this ""concern"" for my health wasn't right somehow but couldn't figure out why right then. Now I know what it's about. This isn't about concern for my health or an over abundance of sisterly love. This is plain and simple EGO. She can't accept that I don't agree with her ""health data"". She has to push and push and push until I give in and agree. The proof is that comment about needing to be able to say I told you so. 

There's probably a big dose of hidden uncertainty in her beliefs as well, since she needs my approval so badly.

Understanding this makes me feel a little better but that fight was super unpleasant and I had a terrible headache for the rest of the day.

OH, and my mom is exactly like this too. Had a follow up discussion with her afterwards and it was just as bad.",QAnonCasualties

180,Perseverance rover is fake...staged in Canada on Devon island 🤦‍♂️ Thanks for making my parents complete conspiracy IDIOTS Q!,"My QAnon Casualty family has declared the launch and landing of the Mars rover Perseverance to be fake and staged. Of course this conspiracy dates back 5 years ago when claims were made rovers were staged and photos taken on Devon island in Canada. I blame this absurd belief on Q because my family once fully believed the rover missions were legitimate and were fascinated with the missions! It wasn't till after they became cult followers of Q they flipped and now literally believe every little conspiracy on the internet regardless of whether or not it has any backing of evidence solely because it's something they hope/want to be true.

When this claim regarding perseverance was made I blatantly replied ""That's about the most STUPID thing I've heard you say thus far! You really need to use your brain and STOP believing these bullshit conspiracies you read on the internet because not everything on the net is true just because you want it to be true!"" Of course they took offense and said ""You just wait...I'll find pictures of terrain that matches the island and then you'll feel like the idiot for believing it actually happened!"" 🤦‍♂️

I'm now at the point I just refute every conspiracy claim they come up with. When they make a claim I immediately start researching into bunking but they inevitably refuse to accept the facts because it's not what they want to believe.

I fear I'm eventually going to be exiled for not following their irrational illogical conspiracies and beliefs nor following the cult of Q. THANKS FOR MAKING MY PARENTS COMPLETE GULLIBLE IDIOTS Q!",QAnonCasualties
181,"Really upsetting. My best friend read the cult deprogramming article I just posted earlier about my story. She said that I, and therefore we, here on this forum, are taking this Qanon thing too seriously. She won’t listen to me when I say it is a very real effing problem and sucks to be involved.","I'm not sure I've seen any posts here about friends and other families discounting Qanon-inflicted suffering. This actually upset me more than my Qanon generally does.

Here is the article I posted earlier again for context: [Can Cult Studies Offer Help With QAnon? The Science Is Thin.](https://undark.org/2021/02/24/cult-studies-qanon/)

 She said that complaining about Qanon and its believers is an overly 'woke' thing.\* It really pissed me off. The Qanons are abusive and toxic. I told her that this is tearing families apart and she disregarded it. She disregarded thousands of people's experiences with this nonsense. 

She claims the article proves that brainwashing isn't a real thing, which the article does address, but didn't mention that psychologists cited in the article believe that maybe these people just might be doing this all on their own. They do it by their own agency which is more disturbing. Qanons choose to be jerks.

I'm not cutting her off or anything. It was just pretty insensitive. That's not what friends are supposed to do. Fake empathy. C'mon, make the minimal effort.

I found his proclamation on Failsbook posted about a week ago where he has said Facebook sucks and he's moving to Parler.

Of course I can't register on the site (it's not working) so I can not view all of his feed and I'm afraid of what I might find.

He may be totally fine but he might not be. 

I don't know what to do outside of keep an eye on him and tip off the feds if I have proof that he's a credible threat to himself or others.

I'd call him Q adjacent right now, meaning some of the misinformation is getting into his orbit. He believes whatever he sees posted on Facebook.

My aunt has always been very opinionated, and not shy about sharing it. The last four years, that side i only glimpsed before came roaring to the surface.  Racist comments, and just plain nastiness.  I saw a woman i once admired turn into a bad person.

And then the vaccine. She knows damn well i intend to get it once its available to me, and being that she's in the medical field I was surprised when she voiced her opposition. Not concerns, straight up against it.  I'll be upstairs and if the news is on and they mention either Biden, the vaccine, or anything like that, I hear her cussing at the tv, just horrible things.

I dont know how deep into Q she is, but ive seen her watching videos, reading forums, all that. She doesnt hide it.

Our father passed away a few months before the pandemic and she never really dealt with his passing, the fact that myself my brother and mom lived across the country didn’t help. We had no idea she was sucked into her phone 10-12hrs per day and saying wild conspiracy theories. Her ex husband/co parent found her Twitter were there were around 5,000 tweets of qanon rants within a couple months of quarantine. I’m the only democrat in my immediate family so we got into arguments a lot and stopped talking a couple months before the events but I had no idea where these conspiracies were coming from. She ended up leaving one day and flying to Los Angeles, fearing what she would do especially since LA is seen as a liberal area my brother flew out there to make sure nothing happened. She than made him take her to Michael Jackson’s house i guess because of beliefs of child sex rings? My brother said she was so sure of the code to get through the gate because of info she received from qanon members and even said crazy things to the security guard she also started saying crazy things about her mother in law sexually abusing her kids with no bearing in truth what so ever she said she “just knew it” After getting her to come to our area in Florida and letting her know the severity that she’s going to lose her kids due to abandonment and crazy tweets both there fathers were worried for her mental health she agreed to goto mental health treatment. After leaving one facility and going to another none of us knew anything about she refused any kind of medication and hasn’t done therapy since she left. Her ex husband won’t let her see her daughter whos older because she’s not taking meds or doing therapy and he wants to see results and I can’t blame him. It seems like she has no plan and I feel so bad for her kids and am still angry at how she’s acting. We’ve gotten into fights recently and the rest of my family is almost ok with it outside of the episode since there on the same “team” it suites narrative. She left one of the most liberal states and I feel like she feels better being down here still since it’s republican which is so silly to me and crazy to leave your kids over. She’s always been very smart and a good mother and I don’t know what I can do to help her. She keeps it under wraps for the most part and when she’s around I try to avoid political conversations but sometimes can’t bite my tongue when the misinformation and lies start coming out. As recently as the inauguration she said something was going to happen than when it didn’t claimed it was staged and Biden isn’t really the president. She drives all over the state/country by herself and even drove to a trump rally 12 hours away. I worry about who she communicates with in qanon and that she goes all over alone. I know it’s only a matter of time until another episode since she’s not doing therapy or taking medication. I worked in drug and mental health treatment for 7 years speaking with addicts, alcoholics and mental health patients about going into treatment but I have no idea how to handle any of this especially since she sees me as the “enemy” and it’s so sad i feel like I’ve almost lost my sister and even worse her children have almost lost her as well.

My ex best friend, who I was friends with for 18 years, thinks ANTIFA is going to storm her family’s home. 

We grew up together, and in the last year she has had told me her darkest thoughts of suicide. As the elections came closer, she became more paranoid that BLM and communists were going to storm her suburban family home. Yet, she went to attend a Trump rally a few nights before the election, and was an active member of the Walk Away Campaign. 

Once Biden won the election, she was convinced Trump was not going to leave the White House. Yet, she continued to also threaten suicide and eventually, my self and another friend who works in mental health care got her to commit into an outpatient program for depression. She also has an addiction to alcohol and LSD. 

Now she believes that neo-Nazis don’t exist (???), that it was wrong for her to join an outpatient depression program, and that children are being trafficked by Hollywood.there were many other deep personally problems going on, so we stopped being friends. She got angry at me for not believing any of this, and then gaslighted me. 

I recently listened to a podcast talking about QAnon and it hit me... I think my friend is part of QAnon. I never put two and two together because I was more concerned about her suicidal intentions. I’ve tried everything I can, as well as her closets friends. Her family also follows QAnon, so they don’t think she has any mental health issues. Her brother is the worst too, because he wears his MAGA hat on social media. 

She reaches out every several days to talk, but then when I try to be polite and talk to her, she tells me I’m wrong for being liberal. My friend is also VERY well known in the area, and I’m genuinely concerned about her reputation. I don’t side with her, but out of respect of our years of friendship, I don’t want anyone hurting her, even if she is creating this trouble herself.

207,Accepting that this wasn’t out of the blue,"&amp;#x200B;

Thank you everyone in this community for your bravery and support.

My parents have gotten to the point of stopping their local newspaper to subscribe to Epoch Times, my mom has joined the local Republican women’s group after never joining anything of that nature before and leaving their old church because they were “too liberal” on social justice. It seems most local Republican chapters in predominantly white areas wholeheartedly still embrace Trump and all the conspiracy theories that go along with it. My dad recently sent me the Mike Lindell “documentary” as his great example of election fraud and has sent me Gateway Pundit links.

In the lead up to the election, I really struggled with accepting my parents’ about face on Trump and acceptance of more bizarre claims. I thought about ways to convince them how terrible he was and thought there was some magic that could “save” them. We had a big fight after I decided to not visit them for Christmas due to them not taking proper COVID precautions. But after a lot of soul searching, I realized that this was a later stop on a decades long journey outside of the mainstream.

My parents’ personalities can be vindictive and negative. I think that has roots in mental health issues but has left them ripe to embracing certain religious ideologies that lean into perceived persecution. These leaders use charged, emotional, and fear filled propaganda almost identical to right wing secular media. It aligns with the worst parts of loving, honest people. 

My parents haven’t evolved with the times. Leaders like Franklin Graham and James Dobson, although always fringe didn’t seem nearly as much so when I grew up in the 90s. Society continued to evolve and gain new understanding, but my parents kept following the same leaders who refused to update their views on claimed “religious principle”. It fed right into the perceived persecution narrative and when that is your frame of mind, it is easy to find a scapegoat.

Evangelical beliefs leave people really open to believing these types of wild ideas in other aspects of their life. Religion became a larger part of my parents’ life over time and along with that wilder ideas about creationism, distrust of science, distrust of the same educational institutions they went to, etc.

So, having a leader like Trump only tapped into an existing network of fringe beliefs and gave them the ultimate platform.  You could previously laugh or shrug off these ideals because they weren’t molding public policy or causing 10s of thousands of unnecessary deaths from people not taking covid seriously.  Many religious sects have given bigotry a cover in the US for a long time and I think we’re at the breaking point of what that results in.

It’s not easy to accept the advanced limitations of our relationship and I still do have anxiety about the next leaf they may turn, but the reality is they’re past a point of no return on mainstream rational thought.",QAnonCasualties

211,Dad told me days after the election Democrats were gonna put him in a concentration camp. We've barely talked since.,"I'm glad this group exists. Due to the pandemic I had to move in with my family for the foreseeable future. This started almost a year ago. My dad is a hardcore Trumper and after a month or two of being home I gave up engaging him. Every day leading up to the election he spent 2-6 hours online researching the election or talking to my friends and family members who were Pro-Trump. The conversations were always full of sarcastic laughs and a lot of hate. He started to form a victim complex where anytime anything happened politically he started to act like he was being oppressed. We live in an 800k house which is a 2 min walk from the beach. And he retired at 58. 

2 days after the election we watched Trump's press conference where he said he believed the election was rigged. I asked him what he thought. He said Democrats fabricated 5-10 million ballots and that he was in a rush to move to a red state before ""Democrats put him in a concentration camp"". I walked out and I haven't been able to talk or look at him much since. I'm in a bind financially as I've started a new career but I'm trying to desperately to move out. Since the election he's cut back big time, but that conversation still lingers over me. And I don't know if it'll ever go away. Does anyone else feel similar?",QAnonCasualties

My parents have been on the downward slide into this stuff for years, but with Biden getting elected they went full conspiracy theory. Biden runs a pedophile ring, chips in the vaccine, Covid is a hoax, etc. I had to block both of their emails because they kept sending me madness after I asked them not to repeatedly. I’m a progressive and so as you can imagine, I’m the black sheep. They haven’t totally rejected me, but since they won’t take the Covid vaccine they’re not likely to see my 6mo old daughter for years. I have no clue what a path forward looks like with them. Feels like they’re beyond hope and they already weren’t life giving people for me. The rest of my family has banded together and I have some surrogate family that I’ve made over the years, but it’s practically like my folks are dead to me or live in another country I’ll never visit.

A story I have told here before re: my anti-vax chiropractored father is featured. I hope it is helpful in some way to people here &amp; maybe outside of Reddit as we learn more.....,"....as we learn more about how to deal with this Qanon mental hijacking of people we care about.   I've crossposted over at [r/QAnonCasualties](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/), [r/ConspiracyPsychology](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyPsychology/), and [r/Qult\_Headquarters](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qult_Headquarters/).

[Can Cult Studies Offer Help With QAnon? The Science Is Thin.](https://undark.org/2021/02/24/cult-studies-qanon/)

I'm not surprised to see that cult deprogramming hasn't been found to be effective. My understanding is that controversial actions by concerned family and friends like surprise interventions for substance abuse and other actions such as kidnapping one's child for behavioral 'boot camps' are not necessarily helpful as well.\*  Kidnapping seems downright unethical as well.

This article is really interesting and a bit discouraging. Michael Schulson who has written in several high-profile publications about science and psychology contacted me after seeing a post I wrote asking about Qanon deprogramming. He now edits and writes for [Undark.org](https://undark.org/)  Undark is a non-profit, editorially independent digital magazine exploring the intersection of science and society. His articles for [undark.org](https://undark.org/)  can be found [here](https://undark.org/undark-author/michael-schulson/) and other articles he's written can be found [here.](https://michaelschulson.weebly.com/selected-samples.html)

EDIT: I should also mention that the discussion of brainwashing vs agency is interesting. I know there has been a lot of discussions, here and in other places about whether the recent political climate and conspiracy theories are just bringing out something that was already there: racism, abusiveness, and general unpleasantness. That's even more concerning in my opinion. They are actively choosing to be this way.

218,Q In-laws,"Hello Everyone,

New to this forum.  Looking for some advice. 

My in-laws have become q-obsessed and its causing challenges between my wife and them and my wife and I.  The background....  My in-laws retired early in 2008... big house on a lake... they were hit pretty substantially in the recession and I don't believe they've recovered.  They've since downsized to a smaller house.  At that time, my father-in-law pulled all his $ from the stock market at the bottom and started investing Gold, Silver, and other sketchy sounding investments.  They got caught up in the Iraqi Dinar scheme in the early 2010's and would bring a tupperware of Dinar to bury in our yard when they visited because you ""couldn't trust the banks"" and they needed access to it when it revalues... or whatever it was supposed to do.  I never really got involved and kind of just left it along.  At the beginning of Covid they brought boxes of freeze dried military foods for us... which I also thought was weird.  Then this fall we discovered they were Qanon followers.  It started when at their house when my brother-in-law pulled me aside and mentioned some weird child sex trafficking/Democrats beliefs they were telling him about (my b-in-law is a NRA loving conservative).  Again.. I largely stayed out of it.  The heat turned up when my m-in law was staying with us for a month watching our months old daughter.  Trump came up and I questioned how she could handle his horrible tweeting and terrible handling of covid.  Her response was a bit odd... ""you just wait"", and agreed you can't watch just foxnews... but then saying cause its too mainstream...  And also questioning if I was a BLM supporter... (which I don't actively support, but have no problems with it).  It was a bit contentious but overall the conversation was fine.  Basically, cause I don't support Trump I must be a liberal... not the case... just think he is terrible.   This next weekend, she attended a maskless Trump rally... which forced me to take two weeks of work to watch our daughter because of concerns about covid at the rally...  She apologized profusely and ""covid never crossed her mind"".  Long story short, they've continued to express all the Qanon beliefs to my brother-in-law, which he calls me about alarmed.  He's a strong right guy (who can acknowledge Trump is an ass) but that makes him safe to talk to for them.  I've send my wife data/podcast interviews. etc on how to deal with Qanon people... she gets upsets and doesn't want to think about it.  Her relationship with her parents is becoming a bit fake...call them to be nice and talk about their grandkids.  She's lamented she hasn't had a real conversation with her dad in months...  They are anti-mask, anti-covid, anti-covid vaccine.... it gets tough to talk to them when dealing with covid is a big part of my wife and I's jobs.  Seems like almost anything can draw a snide anit- establishment, media, etc remark.  We are getting concerneda about our elementary school kids being around them. We are thinking no more weekends at grandma and grandpas post covid...  Are we over-reacting?  Do we need to confront them?  My wife already did confront them about covid and the impact is has on our jobs and kid's schooling if we get exposed...They are honoring our wishes when they are around us, but following no guidelines on their own.",QAnonCasualties

225,"QAnon helped me realize a lifelong problem! Shocking, I know!","My siblings are deeply entrenched in QAnon conspiracies.  When my mother fell and was put in hospice last year, she contracted Covid.  The doctor mentioned hydroxychloroquine, but said in her case, it could kill her instantly.  I said no, we don't want it.  My mother was dying, and she had expressed she wanted nothing to keep her suffering going in her dying wishes to me.  My niece told me I was killing her.  My brother tried to get me to turn over my POA.  My mother had expressly stated she could not trust him to make decisions for her.  Once she passed, I've had very little contact with them.    
My brother started emailing me quite a bit about campers, real estate, and cars, all things I'm currently looking for.  No matter how much I told him I wasn't interested in the fixer-uppers, he continued to send them to me.  Then he sent me a link to a song that he said has been his favorite for some time.  Old America by Moccasin Creek.  I hated it.  I told him I didn't care for it at all.  He became hostile.  Told me I was full of bogus bs negativity.   Sent me a link from [gab.com](https://gab.com) about dead babies in tunnels underneath DC that Don Trump was involved in rescuing.  Didn't believe something I said, but believes this bs from [gab.com](https://gab.com).    
Then it hit me.  This has been his pattern our entire lives.  Disagree with him in any fashion, and he attacks.  My niece is the same way.  My sister just wisely drops the subject.  But my brother and niece just get really nasty if you don't look up to them and their opinions.  I've always wondered why I have such a hard time opening up to people.  It hit me like a wave washed over me.  It's because of them.  If i opened up about my feelings, I get attacked.

After getting no replies from him despite a continuous barrage of conspiracy theory videos from him (most of which I watched), I told him to stop sending them, that I didn't want to receive any more conspiracy shit.

I wasn't mean. I simply don't believe his BS. He needs to get off the internet.

Bro has experienced homelessness and is a recovering addict (SURPRISE). He has a fractured sense of self to begin with and has always enjoyed being just a little bit cruel to me. Now his traditional, bully-esque mansplaining has been replaced with QSplaining and there’s just no fucking stopping it. 

I could just bail, but for the fact that he’s currently living with my mom in the house I own as he works to renovate his own house next door. He’s taking care of her, which is great, but I can’t even go see her without this nonsense. Expressing boundaries doesn’t work - he is COMPELLED to holler about this crap until he runs out of breath. Luckily he’s a felon and can’t wave his shotgun around without ramifications, but (and yeah, it keeps getting better) he actually has oversized adrenal glands and his temper is starting to get out of control.

Mom feels okay living with him (“we don’t discuss politics and he goes to get all the groceries and we do puzzles together”) but when I come over, it’s a whole different game. The house feels unsafe. And it’s my fucking house.

Too much time and money on their hands. Moms didn't have to work, didn't get educated and ended up with large homes and no worries for the most part. This is truly the most entitled generation in my opinion. It's just always more popular, at any time in history, to label the younger generations as entitled and lazy. I went to college and have worked for 30 years. Mom and MIL had no education and barely worked, I found real estate to be a popular occupation of their gender and generation. They were always around, not at the office 8 plus hours per day. The rest of us are suffering from trickle down economics. I miss the Greatest generation. There's no way most of them would buy into this nonsense. The ones that fought and had to deal with WWII. Out of all my extended family the Boomers have been the most financially secure,  been able to own large homes, have multiple homes, travel and retire early. I'm using the Greatest, Gen X and Millenial as the comparison. This Boomer generation has too much time on their hands and the ones minimally literate in a social media sense are the biggest Q offenders.

Then later attempted to get us to watch a video about Adrenochrome, as well as talk about all the kids (thousands!) he says were rescued and brought up into tents in Central Park, a list of celebs executed by Rommel death,  and talk about the “baby eaters” in government. 

Theres a ton of backstory here, but I am searching for a way out. Is this kind of verbal assault (I mean this figuratively, not legally...maybe?) a cause for protection orders?

I’m a Christian and don’t believe that just reading the Bible and looking to really feel love for Jesus is a true end purpose of becoming holy. One could debate that I suppose but I have no energy for that as I’m moving forward with my own life.

What I do need to vent is my anger today. I am aware it’s part of the grief process and that I’m grieving over someone who is still alive but an entirely different person. I am angry at him for breaking my trust. More than that I’m angry at Trump and Q and all their supporters who idolize the man and the movement. How carelessly they broke relationships of all kinds with absolutely zero compassion or regret.
They turned people into monsters for their own selfish gain.

I really want to light into my roommate and tell him what a complete fool he’s been. He has lost someone who would have grown with him spiritually in a loving relationship.

I'll keep the details simple so as not to embarrass anyone that doesn't deserve it:

I know an aggressive and uneducated man, who is unfortunately tied to someone I care about. He's always been a dbag, but the Q stuff gave him new reasons to push people around. He is relentless in his violent opinions of any perceived liberals, frequently spouts ignorant and racist comments, and has yet to be held accountable for any of his abuses.

As many of you are likely aware, sometimes we have to be the bigger person and just sort of let the stupid roll off us and not argue, which I have done countless times when dealing with these ppl....but eventually even the nicest person should defend what is right and condemn what is unacceptable.

""Might be time to ask people if
 they're Republicans or Democrats
 and if they admit to being a
 Democrat kill them right then and
 there and go to their parents house
 and ask the same question.""

Oh, and when the state Capitol was boarded up after they received threats (following the 6th), he said ""I hope they burn that bitch down.""

I told him more ppl could see his posts than he thought, that it was sickening, and he was potentially calling for the execution of his own friends, neighbors, and family.

He's loaded, and deals with millionaires in his line of work, and his being a Republican has always been tied to not wanting to pay taxes, and having no empathy for anyone who isn't a rich white guy like him. There's always been some underlying racism/sexism but the main thing is not wanting to pay taxes and general disdain for anyone who isn't wealthy. 

He is educated and works in a science-related field, but is a Fox News watcher. I know that there are plenty of educated and intelligent people who have gotten sucked into Q but I think it would be a bridge too far for him. He's always been a jerk, but I've never thought that he was stupid. 

Now, Q seems to be mainstream within the Republican party, and I am curious how the average, doesn't-want-to-pay-taxes Republican is dealing with that? I just can't see my relative and his rich buddies humoring these Q people on the golf course or putting up with them talking about adrenochrome while they smoke their gross cigars in the country club.

243,Apophenia,"Apophenia is 98% of how Qanon operates and generates their conclusions.  “Apophenia is the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between seemingly unrelated things. And the unmotivated seeing of connections accompanied by a specific feeling of abnormal meaningfulness""

Followers say that “there can’t be this many coincidences so it must be true” but fail to realize The painstaking nature taken to draw some of these conclusions.

244,How does this not all end in war?,"Is the thing I keep thinking since cutting off contact with my insane Q mother in January. The only tools we have in America to deal with something like this are education and democracy. Unfortunately, both of those things require a willingness to listen from the other side. If my mother, who just weeks prior to our break told me I am the most important person in the world to her, won't listen to me at all- Who is she going so listen to? No one in politics is going to be convincing her. She is way past her school days, and she has already chosen to ignore the son who is far more educated than she is, anyway. She has given up her son and her grandchildren in favor of this twisted fantasy.

How does this all end in anything but violence? My mother and her awful husband are armed, they're angry, and they're delusional. I am literally the only person who might've reached her, and I failed. And she is not alone. The people from the Capitol Insurrection didn't set sail for distant shores. They went right back to their small towns. They're still here among us, they're still angry, and they're still armed to the teeth. It feels like a matter of time before they rise up again.

245,"Q-Anon checks the boxes for other types, not just conservatives","Conservative values definitely are represented in Q, emphasizing a rural attitude of distrust in government where they feel they are legally entitled to strike back at it if they don't like what they are seeing.

I listened to a podcast that actually brought up a good point though.  Q-Anon, in addition to being conservative, also has elements of mysticism, new age thinking and counter-culture.  What would be considered left-leaning and some former Obama voters have found themselves enthralled.  Some find Q talk meshes well with their talk of enlightenment.  Q fulfills former hippies need to feel as a group apart, participating in counter-culture movement.  

I personally find it disturbing that formerly free-love hippies(not all) would now actively engage as a group that desires to see enemies destroyed.  

I think people with a lack of emotional intelligence combined with a disinterest in fact finding and discernment ultimately are the most vulnerable.  Obviously that includes former left-leaning older voters.  'Boomers' getting lost in a volley of too much information coming at them at once.  When you understand the structure of government, you understand that these wild ideas of a storm could not even work on paper, much less in the real world.  Q supporters profess to love America, but they don't know the structure of government...they want a king, or fuhrer who ham-hands their crazy agenda and drives over their opposition.",QAnonCasualties

248,How slippery is the slope?,"I have some cousins who were not well educated and then went into the military. Came out with a very “get your guns ready, they are after our white rights and our bibles!” mindset. 
I don’t mean to say that this happens to all low-education persons going into the military, I have nothing but gratitude for our troops and service members, and I’m proud of the service these two cousins have given. But, this is what has happened to my cousins. They went in one way, came out another way. They may have been highly susceptible to certain things they heard, to begin with. They had an evangelical, probably racist upbringing. 

Anyway they are not yet Q, as far as I can tell, but it sure is a slippery slope and I’m wondering if it is inevitable... 

They are obsessed with being transphobic. Like, someone asking to have certain pronouns used is taken as a complete infringement on THEIR rights, somehow. Obsessed with invalidating trans people. I learned this transphobia is a door to Q for some people. 
 They also absolutely hate the idea that anyone would talk about systemic racism or white privilege. This is hard because my own work is in correcting problems of systemic inequality. So I really don’t associate with them much anymore, it’s just too much. They really take me saying “we have systemic issues of racism that can be corrected if communities work together and change policy, legislation and culture” as me saying “down with the white man! You’re all evil! You all personally did this to our American system and I want to take your very rights away!”. It’s ridiculous. 

And of course the second amendment is their GOD. 

I just see them going further and further down this path, where they will not use common sense, where they feel victimized by any change that honors the reality of POC or trans people... and I feel like they are playing with fire. I leave them alone mostly but there are small children involved so I worry that they will go full Q. They are young men with their lives ahead of them. It’s very worrisome. And they are absolutely full of anger, anger that they are asked to consider that anyone who doesn’t look like them may have a different life experience and may have different needs. Anger that they can’t flaunt all their giant guns and be applauded for being gun-nuts everywhere they go. SO MUCH anger at Hillary Clinton for even EXISTING. And so much trump love still. 

So how slippery is the slope? If it walks like a Q and talks like a Q, but hasn’t openly claimed Q or any of the particularly insane conspiracies... is there a chance they will just stay where they are, idealogically? Where they are is NOT good, but for their children’s sake I do see it as better than full blown Q. 

To those losing closer family and friends to this, my heart aches for you. I don’t even see these guys very often, my concern for them is because I saw them grow up and I love them. But they aren’t impacting my daily life and before I close this post I just want to say, it still tears me up inside. So I can’t imagine having it even closer to home. My heart is with you that live with this insanity in the home, and I hope for all of you to find peace.",QAnonCasualties
249,Another Fractured Family thanks to Q,"Growing up, it was just me and my brother and my mom. Looking at family photo albums, I knew my dad had 2 kids from a previous marriage (half siblings), but we never met. Fast forward to 2006, and I get a call from my half sister. She found out about us after our dad died, and it was very exciting to have new family!

Everything was great. I flew out of state to visit them a few times. We would keep in touch by calling each other every few months. We had our differences (I'm a damn Yankee atheist progressive, she and her husband are southern conservative Christians), but family is family. We cared about each other and everything was great.

Then 2016 happened. Her husband made things absolutely intolerable. A recent visit was marred by ""discussions"" about politics, and her husband would constantly post the most extremist, vile, awful stuff on Facebook. I've since left Facebook, and haven't talked to them since.

I feel awful about it, but what do you do when people you love become really involved in a cult? I simply can't reconcile with that part of the family and their bigoted, ignorant beliefs. What's sad is that they have two daughters that are just the sweetest, smartest kids. They'll likely become poisoned by whatever mind-rot they espouse, and I can't do anything about it.

To anyone who lost family and friends to all of this, I'm empathetic. I think it's important to share our stories so that we know we're not alone. If the time ever comes where these folks see the error in their ways, I think it's important to let them know how you feel/felt, and attempt to reconcile. If they fail to see that they are following a cult of disinformation and bigotry, then they deserve the consequences of a fractured family.",QAnonCasualties

A mom who is intelligent, has a Masters degree, loves family, crafts, music, movies, who has been steadily moving further and further right (thanks in large part to being forced to isolate with her Alex Jones quoting, homophobic/racist/bigot/alt-right husband). Didn’t really get worried until about late 2019 when she started sending out links to people &amp; organization identified by the SPLC as hate groups. 2020 though...she went from the frog in a gradually warming pot to a frog in a pot of boiling oil that she is absolutely determined to push, pull, or drag her friends and family into, truth be damned. 

I’m sick, absolutely sick. I used to talk to my mom a few times a week. Now it’s all I can do to make a token call every few months. I love her but to see and hear the things she says...I can’t be around her if I hope to avoid moving from love to full hate. I’ve tried carefully walking her through facts, taking her to original materials like court documents, videos posted on her preferred sources (ok, not lately since she’s now convinced Fox is a weaponized Antifa-run propaganda machine), but facts be damned if A batshit crazy crackhead pillow salesman makes a fucking video.

253,I think my Q family members were lured in by disguised racism and misogyny,"“Make America Great Again” really means go back to the 50s when every white man was the king of his castle. Even if he had a shit job, at least when he got home he was the boss. The women knew they were there to look pretty, be maids and raise the kids. Legally, sex with her couldn’t be defined as rape. That was all reinforced by women not having their own money or jobs (usually) so they couldn’t leave, especially with multiple kids (5 and much more was common.) It was acceptable to spank ( or in some place more) kids, and you could require them to be seen and not heard.

POC were “suitably “ deferential and knew their place. That was often cheap, dirty labor and service jobs. Their living situations were far away or otherwise hidden from view, so one didn’t have to think about it.

Christian values were flaunted. of course chastity was enforced on women much more stringently than men. Husbands often got to make the decisions about their wive’s bodies.

My partner is largely covid antivax, but not fully down the Q rabbit hole (mostly, I think, because he isn’t white or american or religious). But he does believe that the vaccines have long term side effects (pathogenic priming), covid numbers are made up (largely because all U.K. deaths are being logged as such, within 28 days of a positive test), but that covid lockdowns are all the first steps in the great reset. 

We have respectfully agreed to not discuss any of this as we are so misaligned, (which is working for now), but I am still trying to understand what it is that he believes when it comes to the great reset.

One of my other friends pointed out that it was fake, and I looked into it and agreed/admitted that yes, it is actually fake, and I also posted a link to a fact checking site where it is deemed fake, because that's what a normal, sane person does when they find out they shared something that wasn't true.

260,This worked for my friend.,"First of all, I honestly believe that some 'news' sites and Facebook echo chambers are like drugs and far right followers and conspiracy theorists are the addicts, they need to be weaned off this feed and drip fed with some positivity. 

A friend of mine was DEEP into this and I don't want to go into too much detail or background as it hurts too much. I have known this person for over 20 years. My one last shot to help him worked. I want to share it with you.   

His phone was experiencing problems and I said I would be happy to look at it for him. He needed to replace his SD card and I said I would back up his pictures and reset his phone with a new card. 

As I was doing this and going through his old pictures, it made me really sad as I could see how his interests changed from loving the outdoors and being in nature to quite unhinged beliefs about conspiracy theories. 

After backing up his pictures and sorting his phone out, I logged into Facebook on his phone and unfollowed ALL the hate and conspiracy groups he follows on Facebook, literally every single one. I then started following picture pages like 'Beautiful villages' and woodworking pages with arts and crafts stuff that he USED to love. His hobbies included woodworking so I followed a few pages on that. He also had an old car he has been wanting to fix up so I followed some pages on them. 

I gave him his phone back and he complained a few times about how Facebook ""is all messed up"" and I said I would look into it for him but never did.

This was about 3 months ago. 

Now everytime he grabs his phone to get his next 'hit' of confirmation bias, he is faced with scroll after scroll of non-offensive material. NO news, NO hate, NO propaganda. Slowly, he is emerging out of this and each time he shares non offensive material from one of these pages it makes me smile. I have even started following a few of these pages myself so I can tag him in stuff I think he will like. 

There is still a LOOOONG way to go on this journey but I truly believe he is heading in the right direction now as he seems a LOT happier and nowhere near as angry as he used to be.",QAnonCasualties

My brother recently told the family that he “can’t talk about it” but he’s being vetted by a group called the Idaho Assembly. He lives in Boise. He says it’s a group of “good people standing up for our rights” and that this Biden thing is “terrifying for America.” Sounds harmless right?

He proceeds to tell me that they use VPN or dark web to communicate so they can’t be tracked. They require you never tell anyone any more specifics. They’re “vetting” him. He was brought in by a longtime trusted old friend. Sounding less harmless. 

I have this horrible gut-wrenching feeling it’s something much darker than he’s revealing. I’ve had my suspicions that’s he’s caught up in Q or at least sympathizes. He’s very prone to that kind of conspiratorial thinking, always has been. He thinks the election was rigged, etc etc. Over 6-8 months his Facebook activity went from an occasional birthday wish or tagged photo to sharing far-right propaganda daily. I won’t list all of the different theories he subscribes to, but suffice to say he believes many of the ideas people who are scared of progress and misinformed believe in (my commentary). 

I asked him explicitly if this group was violent and expressed my deep concern for getting caught up in any “secret” group. He of course says it’s not violent and that he has a right to fight for his beliefs. 

I’m posting this because I’m trusting my immediate instinct that this sounds dangerous, that something is off. Has anyone heard of this particular group? Are there specific militant or violent sects of QAnon? Or is Q not necessarily linked to violent groups, just online stuff?

267,How do Q followers never doubt their perception?,"This is a genuine question for those who have Q followers close to them in their life. Thankfully, I have none, so I’m having a hard time understanding for myself how they think. 
So I’ve been through my own trauma and hardships in my life, in fact similar to what many Q followers have gone through. As a result, I feel like sometimes I have a heightened need for outside validation in my emotions and perceptions of reality to assure myself I’m seeing things clearly. This is probably a result of the gaslighting I’ve been subject to at a developmental age. This is just generally speaking. 
My question is, how does this thought/idea of “could I be wrong? Could my perception not be based in truth?” not occur to Q followers at all??? They’re constantly being confronted by things counter to what “their truth” is, by media, by scientists, by family members. Do they never ever even entertain the thought that their perception of things are skewed? How do they constantly reassure themselves that THEY are the ones with their heads on straight? Even if I tried to surround myself with an echo chamber of likeminded people, I don’t think I could ever isolate myself completely from the haunting thought of whether or not I was always right — especially when relationships with others and my own well-being is on the line. 
The person who gaslit me in my youth was narcissistic. The narcissistic person would have their own perception of reality that they would push on me as fact. Is this directly related to the way Q followers think? Do they all suffer from a narcissistic personality where their agenda is solid as stone? Do you think these individuals have doubts deep deep down, but they have a way of dismissing them before they rise to surface enough to have them question their beliefs? If so, in what way do they do this?
I’m just baffled by Q anon followers’ unwavering ability to believe in their narrative. Even the things I am most sure of in my life, still have enough curiosity surrounding them to allow for doubt.",QAnonCasualties

Here's the thing.  Before Jan 6th occured I had several of my Trumpist family members call me and ask me if me and my husband were ready for the 6th.  They were insinuating a civil war was going to start that day, to be prepared.   I remember my response being, 

""yes I'm ready to get these election results solidified and on to a new President""

Of course they stayed quiet.  My mother a Trumpist also noted she knew some people going to the capital to support Trump and that she thought they were crazy bc of how bad it's gonna get down there.  A Trumpist calling other Trumpist crazy....lol...

anyway, Mind you this was first few days of January that my fam asked me about Jan 6.  When I responded to my brother about it, he called me a POS on fb, told me to not come running to him for protection when shit hits the fan then  blocked me....Nice!  A very close friend of 33years also blocked me after calling me a communist and telling me I live in a fantasy world and will be crying when I see whats to come and wishing I listened.

So my question is this...IF Trump didn't instigate, and the Q cult didn't instigate the 6th then WTH were all these wackos talking about?  They obviously knew or were having communications amongst themselves in their groups and chat rooms!  

My ex friend who blocked me on fb of course now cries that these weren't Trump supporters who attacked the capital...of course they were the democrat liberals looking to make Trump country look bad...of course!!! SMH. yet this ex friend told me before the 6th that I'd be crying when I see whats coming.  How interesting!  

So have any of you experienced similar notices or questions from ur Qrazies before the 6th as if they knew something was being planned?

I mean it's pretty obvious to me and I know all you agree but they can't even see this when it's as clear as day and I question them about it!!!!  

We are seriously in the upside-down with these people.

Now none of my Qrazies mentioned anything to me about March...I wonder what they're thinking there, it's pretty obvious to me they're dreaming up something.

And you can't argue with math.""","My Dad, who went to an Ivy League College, has had a very successful career, and lives in a Liberal state in a Liberal suburb of a Liberal city is digging his heels into COVID denial so hard it's just painful. His businesses impacted by COVID, like a lot of businesses were, but he has not had to close down any of his businesses. 

I live in Los Angeles and unless you live under a rock, we went through a horrible COVID crisis that peaked (I think) a month ago. We were told not to dial 911. There was a massive pile-up of bodies, ambulances lined up around the block outside hospitals, gift shops converted into Covid wards, and things got so bad that they even allowed more cremations than are usually allowed. 

My Dad texted the family group chat that COVID would definitively be over in April due to herd immunity. This article was written by a pancreatic surgeon. I responded by saying ""I sure hope so, LA is still dealing with the aftermath."" 

QDad: Those numbers are garbage. 

Me: Whose? The Doctors and nurses? The funeral directors? The coroner's office which has the national guard with trailers for dead bodies? My own self bc I had to go to the big Kaiser to pick up a prescription and saw the madness from across the parking lot? HOW ARE WE ALL LYING?! AND WHY??

QDad: You can't beat the numbers. There were 0-3.4% excess deaths last year. And that's the CDC. Look at the math. 

\[It was not, in fact, the CDC.\]

\*\*Me googling that on the computer\*\*\*

*Sending link.* 

Me: Dad that's not true according to peer reviewed articles by infectious disease doctors and public health experts. We actually have more excess deaths than usually reported in excess of what has been reported as covid deaths. 

QDad: Thats not true. Do the math. The numbers are the numbers and the math is the math. 

Me: Okay but where are you getting the numbers because I cannot see. Dad, is this going to be like the election thing? 

QDad: You are too smart for this. The military vote in Fulton County was 85% for Biden when in the rest of the country the military vote was 75% for Trump. That's as impossible as getting struck by lightning and winning the lottery on the same day. The numbers don't lie. 

Me: Dad, I am looking at exit polls and the Military's own polling and I do not see anywhere that 75% of active members or Veterans were polling/voting for Trump. I am looking at the Military Times' website, which has the military much more evenly split. And I would think that yes, the military vote would be significantly different in Atlanta (Fulton County) than nationwide, as it has much higher rate of Black voters, first time Democratic voters, and Democratic voters in general. Can you send link so that we are on the same page? 

QDad: The numbers are the numbers. The math is the math. That is so many standard deviations apart its a statistical improbability. You can't argue with math. And yes, the Republican vote in the military is 75%. 

Me: \*\*\*\*physically doing math trying to keep up\*\*\* So actually, I think it would be statistically very possible for Atlanta's vote to be very different than the general vote. I mean...because the Fulton County vote in general is an indicator. Dad,  do you mean they voted Republican or voted for Trump? Like 2004 Bush or Trump 2016? 

QDad: You're too smart to just regurgitate what you see on CNN.

286,Qanon Article Contributers,"I'm in the process of writing an article about Qanon and realised pretty quickly that I don't actually know a huge amount about it and Youtube videos + online resources can only take me so far. Being based in the UK and having a moderate interest in U.S Politics I've been exposed to it a little bit but don't know anyone who has been in contact with the cult directly.

To get some first hand experience I am really interested to speak to people who

a) were previous believers / know someone who believed or still believes to do a short interview with me to understand the human side, the costs, why it is so pervasive ect

b) people who understand a lot about it and are able to give me any background information from a more informative point of view

These could obviously be the same person.

My main aim with the article is not so much to raise awareness of it as I'm not sure what good that will do but explore the causes and reasons that people believe it because I must admit I find it very interesting.

I appreciate this is a sensitive subject for a lot of people, but I if anyone wants to discuss their experience please drop me a message.

If anyone can direct me to any good resources to get a handle on any of the finer details that would be also be very helpful great.

287,Please advice,"Hi, 

My name is Andres from Uruguay in south America.

I need advice because this insanity went to far.

I never had to many friends but suddenly  it seems as if I choose my friends out of Nazi Germany.

The first one is Christian, i ' ve known him since i was 8, he always believed in this conspiratorial B.S. but nevertheless I never took him seriously, know he is totally addicted to this B.S. spending day and night fighting against pedophiles, democrats, left wing people etc. When Trump lost he said, im going to the states to fight till death for Trump and I answered to him, Trump would die for you?

His answer was silence, I asked the brother of my late grandfather about this (he is 104) and I was answered, ""in the 30s i also had to deal with fascist friends, when they started with that issue I asked them to change subject otherwise i would leave, I care more about you done your opinions, you decide"". So he was able to keep his friends for at least 30 years more, but i dont know if I will be so successful.

The second one is Pedro, I met him since I was 5 and we even purchase a car together, he was always a little nerdy and in the lost couple of years he started paying atention to all these culture wars. Abortion, homosexuality, sexual rights etc.

He become obsessed with these issues and later went full anon. He believes so badly about election fraud, covid 19 conspiracies and qanon itself. I told him all arguments possible showing that the fraud was a lie and he answered me ""don't try changing my mind, that's criminal"", I knew this was too much.

I started reading regarding disinformation, conspiracies and other far right issues, I couldnt understand how people so smart and centered decided to adopt these lies. The last time I met Pedro he started with the Dominion conspiracies and I told him it was absolutely wrong and that the judicial branch even said so, and he answered me ""Great idea believing in the judicial branch"".

Later went on and accused me of changing his mind and i answered that is what sects say ""dont dare changing my mind"". 

I wish still being Christian and Pedro's friend but I can't believe these are the people i met so long before, my friends were not fascists. How can they become normal people again?",QAnonCasualties
288,Ran into the Qex today,"I went to the beach and parked where we always parked. I didn’t see his car, so I thought I was fine. I’ve been a lot recently and haven’t run into him. I saw him as I walked over the boardwalk, but ignored it. 

He ran up to me and told me he’s had dreams about me and knew he would see me today. He told me that I was incredibly hostile towards him, and I was. I told him I didn’t like or love who he has turned into.

He asked if I would still accept I was wrong if he had proof...and he definitely had proof. It would just take him a month or two to get it to me. He kept insisting he had proof. I told him to tell me what it was, and that he had 10 minutes. 

The next 45 minutes were spent with him telling me some fantasy story about “people who don’t agree working together to find the truth,” and being upset that I wouldn’t listen to him. I told him I didn’t want some bullshit fantasy that he was laying out. 

I was doing okay. It has been about a month. I have codependent tendencies and this was a huge issue for me early on, but I remained NC. I was doing well, all things considered. I feel like, while our interaction solidified my decision to leave, mentally and emotionally it put me back a few steps. Several, to be honest. 

He told me that he will continue to try to find the truth for me. That he will wait for me. That he will try to make things better for me. I told him I’m moving and I thought he wanted a free ride to where I’m going. I’m not in danger of him going crazy and stalking me (I’ve been through that before). 

But I genuinely think he wants to “wake me up” and wants a happy life for us. But he’s doubled or even tripled down on the Q stuff since we broke up, and I partially think that it’s because we broke up. He’s had nothing else going for him and none of his friends agree with his bullshit. 

It’s hard to see it hurt him so much, but it really solidifies my decision to leave him. Things only got worse. A small part of me hoped that leaving would wake him up. He finally admitted outright to following QAnon, so that was validating.

I really dont have the best relationship with her but since the vax for covid came out she went totaly crazy. I suspect strongly she is on the way to depression or already has some kind of mental illness. The thing is she just wont listen to anything that isnt her way. She is building her own bubble around this baaaaaad baaaaaaad vax. She is posting articels of conspiracy websites and stopt talking to her friends. She tried to convince my grandma to not get the shot. (I had to calm her down after that because she was worried I mithg think as my Mother) She is more and more shutting herself from anyone who tries to talk sens into her. My sister had a huge argument as she was the only one left talking to her about vax and these believes flying around. But my Mother just thinks she is the one who understood the worl and we were just to closed minded. She thinks this Bill Gates stuff is stupid for the ones not smart enough to see throuth all it. I know this woman. (19 years with her made me having to see a psychologist) I am about to shut contact with her but I feel awful by just letting her in this hole she is digging herself...

It's not one of those typical theories that most people ignore, but a story that had to be created by one of those few people. Therefore, it's (in theory) more likely to be true, which I still don't believe. The point is that I have no idea how to react to things like that.",QAnonCasualties

300,Having Qanon parents while being a CSA survivor,"Trigger warning for talk of child sexual abuse / pedophilia.

.

i, like many, have lost my parents to qanon. theyre detached from reality, even going as far as to say biden is being ""hologrammed"" into the white house through special cameras, that hes not actually there. they believe in pizzagate, anti vaxx stuff, that democrats are eating babies, trump is the second coming of christ, all that weird stuff.

the thing that bugs me the most, however, is that as far as my knowledge goes, the point of Qanon is that theres supposedly some whole underground deep-state thing(?) where every democrat ever is a pedophile. and trump, the guy who has multiple rape allegations against him, the guy who raped children and acts creepy with his own daughter...is somehow gonna be the one who stops all this? really?

growing up i had experienced repeated sexual abuse both by a neighbor and a classmate, starting from the age of 4. i told my parents what was happening, and what did they do? they ignored it. they saw me come home with bruises and they just brushed it under the rug. my school didnt give a shit either because the principal was a pedophile too and shut down any of my teachers concerns. they allowed it to continue for years. now im an adult with PTSD, an eating disorder, and addiction issues.

knowing this, and thinking about their attachment to Qanon, i cant help but feel so, so incredibly fucking angry and betrayed. why is this grown man who raped multiple children is the one you care so much about and not your child? was my abuse just not worth trying to help? do they think i lied about it? i dont know what to do. seeing them worship and kiss the shoes of the man who hurt children, made them go through the same thing i did, makes me so sick to my stomach. i cant even imagine how the victims of him feel; to have to see their abuser walk around in the white house being hailed as this all-good evil stopping pedophile killing man, or whatever it is. its disgusting.

i hear my parents talk about how they think that ""if the victims were *really* hurt they would have reported it when it was happening!"" as if they werent children. CHILDREN. they were probably too young and scared to understand what was happening at the time. i never ever want to hear these people talk about how they care so much about saving kids when theyre worshipping a child rapist.

i really, really cant bring myself to be nice anymore or feel pity. i hate this entire movement with everything i have and feel disgust towards anyone who supports it. they are turning a blind eye to actual people who were hurt as children as well as children who are still being hurt, all while worshipping a pedophile. its disgusting and i will never be able to forgive my parents, not after this.",QAnonCasualties
301,Did Q change them? Or did it bring their real selves out more?,"I have read so many heartbreaking stories in here. For me it’s been easier, I have lost some friends, but mostly friends who I used to know and I have now discovered what beliefs they really hold out in the public I guess. 

Fortunately for me, my wife and I are very much on the same page politically on most things, same for my current circle of friends. My family has a few conservatives in it but to the best of my knowledge have a healthy disdain for Trump and all this Q nonsense.

But as I read through here, I have seen so many stories about marriages ending in divorce, couples breaking up, parents disowning their children, children disowning their parents. It’s been really sad. And I realize how lucky I am.

It got me wondering though. Those of you who have had these nasty splits with people closer to you, people you love/d, was it Q? I was Q the final straw? Can this cult really take an otherwise kind and loving person and turn them into these twisted shadows of their former selves?

I must confess, I don’t know a lot about the psychology of cult, but I have been wondering if this many people could have all been this bad a judge of character? It seems to me now that many of the Q followers must have been other people once upon a time, kind people who loved and could be loved in return. 

I’m starting to wonder if my scorn for the bigotry and delusion the Q followers display should be tempered with more pity and sympathy? 

And if this is not who they were, it makes this so much more tragic. It goes from finding out who someone really is to what I can only imagine then feels like a bereavement, a genuine death of the former self. Like seeing their body but the soul, the personality that made that person is gone. And I honestly don’t know what is worse...",QAnonCasualties

305,Ex Qanon former conspiracy member: the single greatest cure for conspiracy thinking,"Is education.  I've been thinking a lot about this after my ama last month. Basically, conspiracy thinking is Organized Ignorance. It feels smart,  it feels like critical thinking, but as the saying goes ""It's easy to think everything is a conspiracy when you don't know how anything works."" 
 
It was a very basic understanding of computers that tipped me off that Q was a fraud. You won't run into many pilots who are flat earthers. You won't run into many (sadly a few) medical doctors who are anti vaccine. There's an old meme among ex Mormons that ex LDS members know significantly more about the history of the church than current members.  
  
There is also a huge amount of conspiracy thinking  based on mistrust in authority and experts. I once saw a pastor from NY preaching about flat earth, but he starts the whole sermon by asking his church to raise their hands if they think the government lies. They all agreed, and that's all he needed to convince them of his insane theory.

306,Partners with QAnon Parents and Very Different Experiences,"My partner and I have been together for just over a year now. Over that timeframe, we have watched side by side as our parents become slowly eaten alive by QAnon. 

My situation is much more stable. My dad is an OG QAnon follower and proudly daunts his Q hat in public. We spoke in depth about Q, it’s history, and what it means to him over the holidays and I was shocked that it turned into a thoughtful conversation from both sides. It ended with my father saying the reason he follows QAnon is for the smallest offhand chance that it might be true outweighs what in reality is a somewhat boring truth.

My partner on the other hand has a much more severe situation. When I met his parents originally they struck me as a spitting image of my family- conservative but not lost on false statements. Once COVID hit, there was a drastic shift in their behavior and they dove in head first into QAnon. His entire extended family encourages them as well, buying bogus Christian based prophecy books with a literal quote I shit you not saying “if the chiefs win the Super Bowl it will be a symbol from Jesus that our commander Donald Trump is too a strong chief”. I found some of this literature while we were house sitting for his parents and I showed him. We flipped through the pages half laughing at these crazy statements. He dismissed it and we didn’t talk about it much after. The months after we’re filled his family picking fights with him and trying to shove their QAnon beliefs down my partners mouth (thankfully he resisted and still has).

Things finally hit a boiling point after the insurrection at the capital. His mother (who is always his worst bully) has been relentlessly targeting, belittling, and deliberately hurting my partner as her way to cope with the fact that QAnons beliefs are crumbling at her feet. Finally, my partner snapped last week and laid into his parents and their QAnon beliefs. They told him that he was brainwashed and by putting him into the public education system/college (he was homeschooled a large portion of his life) they have lost their son to the liberal media. Ultimately, this ended with them cut him off financially. He came home and apologized for not listening to me sooner about my concerns about their QAnon beliefs, but all I could do was apologize to him for how cruel and hurtful his family has been to him for the sake of QAnon. 

We are managing through this situation, but this platform gave me the courage to share our story as well",QAnonCasualties
307,"Lurker, first post","So I've been reading all your stories and I felt it is time to share my own. I'd lost two great friends to QAnon and started to push away a few other friends that started speaking about Q. 

My first friend we will call A. We were best friends in high school and after, we basically were able to get away with typical teenager bs because my parents weren't strict but hers were. Her dad was a Vietnam vet, but never sought treatment and I believe he was abusive to her and her siblings. On June 28, 2017 (my wedding anniversary) her parents died when their home exploded and her youngest sister the only survivor. This is when I think she started to have lots of problems emotionally. She's married, has retired from the Air Force, has two sons and moves to a new state, but still comes back to our hometown to deal with insurance and fighting the company that sold her parents the faulty propane. Now fast track to current times, in I want to say July she started posting some Q on her Facebook and I had read it twice before reaching out ans asking what that was about. She went head first into saying her husband introduced it to her, that she's been watching all these child rape stories come out and basically not sleeping because she has to know how to protect her boys. Her words - you're a mother too, you need to know these signs. She sent me everything- From Behind the Shadows to John P and how he is the true rapist behind all these celebrities and how Tr*mp is going to save us. I watched with an open mind, found it all to be seriously ridiculous and I was afraid of where it was turning her jnto. I told her there is no way a man who has sexual assault charges coming from young kids is going to save us, and she said ""that's because those are false and won't hold up. Why do you think they've never gone through, because they're lying.""  She even told me how long her family won't be sheep and wear a mask because that also was fabricated to control us. She told me how her family in Colorado went to get tested, waited but left ans still got a call they were positive for Covid even though they never got tested. She was still going to send her kids to in school learning maskless and nothing was true about kids getting covid. I stopped poking around with these stories because honestly, I feel like these theories are enough to put someone in a mental hospital and seek treatment, they're making good people turn into crazed nightmares. Unfortunately, I had to stop because at the time we were served an eviction notice from my nmom and things were getting quite rough and she had sent me several videos while we house hunted and got upset with me that I told her I can't watch these anymore. She posted several on her Facebook ans Instagram accounts, and when she deleted those accounts, I blocked them. It still hurts because I truly loved this girl and have so many wonderful memories but she has lost her way and fully drank the Q Kool Aid. 

My other friend is P. I've known her since she and my sister were in elementary and she was also a bridesmaid in my wedding. She definitely would be the type to fall for Q because she followed every trend that she could get into. All summer long, she would post up to 10-15 things on social media A DAY (while having a toddler and becoming pregnant by her deadbeat boyfriend) and it was always hashtag save the children. So I muted her because I couldn't take her seriously, some things she posted would just be so false that even when she was called out for it she found a way to spin it into truth. After she had her second baby, she stopped posting the child abuse links and fell into the whole astrology and witchcraft postings, and how to cut out toxic family members. What made me finally cut her off was again the postings about Tr*mp saving us, that everyone is a child predator and she's warned us all. 

It's really sad that I chose to end these friendships, 20+ years, but these women fell so far into these QAnon lies and chose to only talk to people thst believes this. When I talked to A I tried so hard to get her to come out of this, how it's just people making up stories and rumors to ""cancel"" the celebs they're annoyed by. I just worry because they both have children, how this will affect their parenting and hopefully the kids turn out alright.",QAnonCasualties

This family member is a huge Trump supporter, a lot of my family likes him but she’s extreme, and months back I remember her talking about the sex trafficking, and she also thinks Michelle Obama is a man (idk if that’s related to Q but it sounds like something they would say). She was planning on going to the capitol as well, but I forget why she didn’t end up going. She also said that COVID would go away once the election was over, again this is someone who is going to be a nurse. 

So now my family member is skeptical regarding on if she should get the vaccine or not, I think she’ll end up getting it, but it’s still scary to think about. 

I really can not believe that someone who is going to be a nurse, would advise this. This stuff is getting out of control.",QAnonCasualties

Open because he knows what a hard day I must have had, navigating the world of ""sleepers"" whilst being ""morally superior"" to everyone else. Kissing for refuge from 'the evil"" outside. Hunkering down for a night of heroic ""digital soldiering"", TOGETHER, and feeling a zing of excitement, TOGETHER, about all the ""arrests"" of ""global elites"" carried out that day. Going to bed - TOGETHER, not hours and rooms apart, and sharing, TOGETHER, in a sense of accomplishment for having deepened our understanding of the world and above all for helping to #savethechildren.

323,Kicked out my (stbx) Qhusband tonight...,"I posted before about Q husband getting his gun license, and requiring me to sign off on it.

After I found out he got his license, I told our toddler that if he ever sees a real gun to make sure he never touches it and to call mom or dad.  He repeated this to his dad (I don't think there's anything wrong in telling a 4 year old that) and of course Qultist blows up at me telling me I'm putting fear into our kid about guns. Which I never did. Later our kid goes to bed and Qultist is talking to me about how he'll be safe with a gun, it will never be loaded in the house, etc.

I just tell him that I don't like when he talks about executing people (which is true), and he cuts me off and blows up at me telling me ""what do you think should happen to people who rape children?""...  and if I think he's going to go out killing people, I don't know him at all.  I never said I thought he was going out to kill people, I said that I don't feel comfortable with all the darkness he talks about and constantly talking about executing people.  He tells me I'm mental and that we are living in Communist China (we are Canadian). He also has to throw in, as long as people keep wearing masks, we will be a communist country.  He's standing up for our rights, and I'm just blind to everything.   I just told him to stop talking down to me.  He argues more that I don't support him and asks me what do I even care about? I need to stand up for what's right, and stand beside him because he's been doing this alone. He asks what I want, and I tell him to put his phone down for 1 day!!!  He says I never support him but I've put up with this sh!t for 4 years.  He says it's all at the precipice and then goes back to me not caring about babies being raped and killed... (excuuuuuuse me????)  at this point I just about had it.

He ask if I want him to stay or leave (we had a huge fight a few weeks ago where I told him I was done with his obsession) and I just tell him to 'GO'.  He changes into his QAnon shirt (HUGE EYEROLL) and as he's packing his bag to go stay with a friend, he tells me ""there's only so much a person can take until it's not worth it anymore"".... I mean, can you people believe this???  He's put up with me not caring about the Deep State and cabal and has had enough with me.   Of course, all this after I put my foot down and tell him to leave. I'm not going to have ANYONE tell me I don't care about babies being murdered. Disgusting. Pardon my french, but FUCK HIM!

The manipulation is real with this one.  I'm really sad my marriage is ended.  My first post here was a stark contrast from this one.  Now I'm somewhat relieved I won't have to listen to him rant about the Deep State MSM or cabal, or tyranny, communism, or ANY OF IT.  I feel like I can have my life back.  Tonight I'm going to sit here and watch a movie, whatever movie I want, without having to deal with his bullsh!t.  It's going to be a hard road ahead, but I already feel a weight lift.

I'm obviously super heated right now, but thank you for letting me rant.

Edit: he doesn’t have a firearm yet as I never signed off on his forms.  I was just preemptively talking to my toddler, in case a firearm came into our home (without my knowledge). I’m also NOT afraid of firearms, I just don’t think someone like him should have access to one (maybe before Q, but definitely not now).  A part of me feels like the ‘bad guy’ for not letting him have his guns, but I don’t want to be in the same house with him and firearms",QAnonCasualties

325,Dad maybe Q,"I’m very concerned that my already right-leaning dad is the QAnon cult. He’s a lonely, widowed Boomer (prime target) and on the computer or phone incessantly. Recent call with him raised red flags. I don’t bring up politics with him but he always does. Usually it’s done much more elegantly. This seemed almost scripted which is very unlike him. He kept spouting nonsense. I kept asking him where he heard or read about his (unfounded) information. He would only respond with ‘that’s what I feel’ or ‘believe’. I’ve heard the same crazy shit from others so it’s not new. However the manner in which he was speaking to me was also eerily calm. Which is also out of character because he’s quick-tempered and known to raise his voice. There was none of that. After I asked him to verify a very a specific theory he was rambling on about. He accused me of not respecting his beliefs.  He also said that he didn’t go to a liberal school and no one is going to change his mind. He said so many other nonsensical things that I don’t really remember. I was just stunned. 
Then he told me to think about it. ‘It’ being my supposed disrespect. No sooner than my lips could form a syllable in response, he ended the call! WTF??!!",QAnonCasualties
327,Time to Move On.,"I found QanonCasualties when there were fewer than 3,000 members, and now that number has swelled to fifty times that size, which is both personally comforting and tragic. I have read thousands of posts--now it is my turn to share.

One year ago today, I proposed to the woman that I loved. In the months following the engagement, our relationship fell apart, overwhelmingly due to Qanon. The unique aspect of our story is that my ex-fiancée never believed in Qanon. She is a wonderful person and she is as much of a victim in this story as I am. I can only hope that our story will be a cautionary tale for those experiencing similar situations and that those relationships can persist where ours did not.

Around six months prior to our engagement, I became aware that my ex fiancée’s mother was deeply involved in a movement called Qanon. I did not know much about the movement, other than that it believed in conspiracy theories that were totally illogical. That changed one night at dinner, when my then girlfriend’s mother told me about the cabal of satanic pedophiles that ran the world and would drink the blood of tortured children. With a straight face, she reeled off a dozen names and groups involved in this “Deep State,” and the overwhelming majority of these names were Jewish people and minorities (Soros, Rothschild, Rosenstein, Mossad, Oprah, Obama, etc.).

While I am not very religious, I am Jewish. I spoke out and said that these beliefs were untrue and were anti-Semitic in nature, as the Adrenochrome theory she espoused was almost identical to the rumors of Blood Libel that had existed against Jewish people for centuries. I implored her to find other news sources and to get out of her echo chamber, and at minimum, told her not to bring up these theories around me any further.

Over the following months, the stories continued. I told my girlfriend how much it bothered me, and she asked her mother to stop bringing the matters up in my presence, but to no avail. Finally, after our engagement and the outbreak of the Coronavirus, her mom crossed the line. Just before Easter, the mother spoke of “10 days of Darkness” that would be followed by the military round up of the cabal, which would be taken to Guantanamo Bay to be imprisoned and executed. The parallels of this “Storm” to the Nazi roundup of Jews was too much for me to stand. I looked to my fiancée and her sister and her father and asked them to say something against this hateful rhetoric, and the silence was deafening. In that moment, I felt abandoned, and it reminded me of a famous quote by Martin Luther King Jr., “In the end, we will not remember the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”

I spoke out forcefully and said how hateful and dangerous those beliefs were, and that I would not sit by and listen to lies and the demonization of groups of people, nor would I permit any children we may have in the future to be exposed to such sentiments. The following day, my fiancée’s father called her to revoke the blessing for our marriage, to say that if we did get married they would not attend the wedding, and to say that they would never forgive me. In essence, they gave my fiancée an ultimatum, her family or her fiancée.

While I feel a great deal of resentment towards my fiancée’s mother, the father is worse. The mom was a devout believer in Q and was seriously misguided--she needed help and I said as much. The father, however, was an Ivy League trained psychiatrist and a university professor, and he did not believe in Q—he simply wanted to ignore the problem. When I was no longer willing to listen silently to the hateful rhetoric, he sabotaged his daughter’s happiness to avoid confronting the real problem, that his wife was in a cult. Only a coward would sacrifice his daughter’s happiness to avoid hard truths, and this man is the epitome of a coward, whether my fiancée can see that or not.

For months, my fiancée and I tried to do couples therapy and counseling, but the Q parents made it clear that they would never change. My fiancée, out of loyalty and love for her parents, would not hold her parents accountable. Instead, she asked me to remain quiet and excuse myself if the parents brought up the topic again, and to do so for the rest of our lives. I told her that I would not sacrifice my morals and ethics, and that if they were unable or unwilling to change their behavior, she could have a relationship with her parents, but I would not. Ultimately, my fiancée said that she could not be with someone that did not have a relationship with her family, and I said that I could not be with someone that allowed her family to spread such hate and to knowingly treat me so disrespectfully.

I loved my ex and I am saddened every day by the loss of our relationship. It is a tragedy that our loving relationship fell apart. If anyone out there is in a situation where your partner or your family members are feeling alienated due to Qanon, please know that it is important to support the person that adheres to the truth. Truth matters. Morals matter. And it is important to speak up when you hear lies. Those that spread lies are guilty of transgressions, but those that know better and choose to stay silent are the ones that allow those lies to persist.

Life is full of hard choices, and for one reason or another, my ex made the decision to choose her family over me. She has cut off all communication and has likely convinced herself that she hates me or that I abandoned her, which is far from the truth. I held out hope until now that she would see the light, but our anniversary just passed without any message, so it is time for me to move on. One day, I hope she will recognize how much I loved her.",QAnonCasualties
328,A month after my relationship with my Q boyfriend ended,"My boyfriend and I had been together for 6 years. About 7 months after the very first Q post, he started diving head first into it ALL (aside from flat earth), and his entire world view shifted. He went from a very happy, healthy, outgoing, and loving man, to someone I barely recognized. At first I didn’t know why, because he didn’t share with me why he was spending more and more time at the computer scribbling on his notepad, nor why he was completely withdrawing from his friends/family/eventually me. Finally, when I was cleaning our apartment one day while he was at work, I happened across the notepad that was turned to a numbered page of “disturbing things happening around the world”. This included how the Holocaust was faked, and Hilary Clinton was a satanist pedophile, etc etc. I was shocked and more than a little scared, and a week later told him I was worried about him and that I thought we needed to take a break to focus on our respective mental health (I was beginning my journey through depression at the time). 

5 months of irregular contact later, he seemed to be making the progress I wanted and hoped to see: hanging out with his friends again, spending holidays with family, initiating contact with me again. I, of course, was happy for him, and we resumed our relationship. When I finally worked up the courage to ask him about “all the Q stuff” again, it turns out he had gone even deeper into it. I loved him enough that I tried to have reasoned arguments with him, but somehow he always made me feel stupid and I never made even the tiniest dent in his beliefs. Eventually I just stopped asking, and as time went on, he began slowly bringing these up around our friends and family. With my family, I would simply kick him under the table or shoot him a quick glare to tell him to shut up whenever he made comments that I knew were heading in that direction, but of course I couldn’t tell him what to say in front of his own. 

Fast forward several years to last spring, and I finally just had to stop talking about anything current events related/political/human rights/ANYTHING with him, because we ended up fighting and not speaking for the rest of the day. I was so tired and sad. I basically gave up on our relationship, but COVID and depression (not to mention how toxic our relationship felt by then) I didn’t feel able to leave. 

A month ago, he and I got into yet another argument, and we agreed that there was no point in continuing to be together. I still loved him, but knew that we just had fundamentally different beliefs and couldn’t agree on anything anymore.... As much as this pains me to write, I can’t express how freeing it has been. I’m able to express myself and my feelings about current events &amp; the world in general again. I’m able to talk openly with my friends and family about how crazy Qanon people are, where before I felt hypocritical doing so. I’m not nervous to see people anymore, because I no longer have to carefully navigate topics of conversation so that even the smallest thing won’t set him off. I no longer have to pretend that he isn’t racist/a conspiracy theorist. The other unhealthy aspects of our relationship aside, I can’t believe how long I ignored all the red flags of this mindset. 

This ended up being a lot longer than I intended, but also incredibly cathartic to share. I still don’t want to tell anyone in my life that he is a part of this movement, because I do still care about him and their opinions of him (and therefore me), but I’ve been following this sub basically since it started and thought I might share my experience. Not to say that all Q people are beyond saving, and I hope he is among that group, I just hope anyone who reads this knows that it is TOTALLY okay to prioritize yourself and remove people like my ex from your lives.",QAnonCasualties
329,"Need advice: I've been using a DNS service to block Rumble and Bitchute, but my Q Mom wants me to help her access those sites. How should I handle this?","So my Q mom and I share a lease. My backstory can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/iwvtv7/i_live_with_a_qanon_believing_mother_who_pushes/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/jn7sa3/december_21_2020_a_significant_day_for_quiltists/). She was radicalized primarily through YouTube videos. I [attempted to tweak her YouTube algorithm](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/kik5f2/looking_for_qdebunking_youtube_videos_to_alter/) so she'd get more animal videos and a fewer conspiracy related videos, but it hasn't been a very successful endeavor because it's been more difficult for me to get access to her YouTube account than I anticipated. Plus, she also actively searches for these videos so when I have managed to add dog videos to her watch history, it gets nuked pretty fast.  

Since YouTube began removing some of the more outrageous content she enjoyed and these content producers moved to other platforms, I anticipated that she might eventually try to find her favorites elsewhere. I did some research on how to best block these platforms on our home network and my solution was to buy a Raspberry Pi, install AdGuard Home, and use it as a DNS server. This allowed me to write custom filtering rules to block sites like Gab, Parler (when it's running), Rumble, and Bitchute at the network level without installing anything on her smartphone or desktop. It's also allowed me to keep track of some of the websites she visits and the content is worse than I thought. But I'm getting sidetracked...  

Thankfully, my mom isn't on social media. She doesn't have a Facebook, Twitter, Parler, or Gab account. She isn't tech-savvy enough to figure them out. However, she can navigate the YouTube app on her smartphone. Now that worst of the content has moved to Rumble and Bitchute, she has been made aware of these platforms by the Telegram groups she's joined.\*\*\* Obviously, she doesn't know that I've blocked these sites on our home network, nor does she know that she could turn off wifi on her smartphone and access those sites using mobile data. She asked me today if I could help her ""sign up"" for them. I tried to play it off and I managed to delay the discussion until later. However, I won't be able to postpone this indefinitely. You'd think I'd have thought of how to handle this eventuality when I started blocking these sites, but I haven't. I started blocking them in hopes she would eventually lose interest, but the Telegram groups have driven her deeper down the rabbit hole. I don't have a fully developed response and I was hoping to get some advice on how to handle this.

At this rate, I don't think telling her the truth is an option. A week after the January 6th insurrection, she asked me to help her forward an insane missive by a GOP official in upstate New York to a friend (I could be mistaken on the location), and I declined to do so. She immediately called me traitor to her and to the country, and told me I was censoring her. What ensured was one of the worst encounters we've have over Trump, QAnon, and these other conspiracies since Trump came down the elevator. It was bad and it lasted hours. I don't have the emotional energy to go through that again. The only way we've managed to maintain the peace is to not discuss politics and a significant amount of gray-rocking on my part.  So yeah, no telling her the truth. Perhaps I should just stop trying to limit the amount of disinformation she can access. At this point, it really seems pointless. 

Anyway, thanks in advance for any advice....

\*\*\* Sadly, AdGuard Home doesn't block the Telegram service. You can connect to the service via a proxy, so I thought about adding a proxy that goes nowhere. I don't know if that's even a real thing though, and all of this may be for naught anyways...

Edit: I should probably add that she's not tech savvy, but she's not stupid either. She'll notice if something if it's really obvious, so I have to be somewhat subtle.",QAnonCasualties
330,Do I need to keep in contact?,"My parents were planning to join the coup attempt but decided against it at the last minute.

I don't even know how to talk to them after they cut me off and refused to take my calls on my dad's birthday. I just... can't.

333,Let's make a Deal.,"I just hung up on my mother - not for the first time - and I'm sitting here shaking, reading posts and trying to find some comfort in knowing I'm not the only one struggling with this.

She's on the same ""the COVID vaccine will kill you"" train as others have posted about recently, and is frantic to talk me out of getting vaccinated. I have a PhD in Biology and have taught cell biology to undergraduate classes, but according to her, I'm the one who doesn't understand and ""refuses to read anything from the other side."" But it's not two sides; this isn't an opinion piece. There's science, and there's wild conspiracy based on factually incorrect statements about how biology works.

It's a baited trap - I would love to put some real information in her hands and it's SO hard to accept that logic cannot fight conspiracy - but it's a trap. She will reject everything real out-of-hand because she's been programmed to believe that she has the only credible sources.

335,My father blamed me for giving him a heart attack,"He had a heart attack a year and a half ago because he had high cholesterol and stopped taking his medication because he read online that it doesn’t help.

He’s retired and spends the entire day on the couch on his phone when he doesn’t come into my room uninvited to lecture me about how Trump is saving the world while I’m trying to do homework. He’s also a delusional gambling addict and is convinced that he has figured out the daily numbers game and he will win soon.

Our fight tonight was extremely stupid. It’s 10:00 where I am and he came into my room in his underwear to lecture me about how our frequencies are changing and how he stuck it to the anti-maskers by taking his mask off in the grocery store and stealing from self checkout. I noticed he had some pee on his boxers and asked hom to change his underwear so he didn’t get pee on the couch blankets and he FLIPPED OUT. He blamed me for keeping the dog up all night and making her tired and giving her diarrhea. The dog is up all night because she follows him everywhere and he listens to qanon videos without headphones at a loud volume until 3 am. Then, he blamed me for giving him a heart attack and stressing him out. He accuses me of being a germaphobe but I really think I have basic hygiene. The bathroom is right next to my room, and I have to remind him to wash his hands after he shits, and then I get mocked and laughed at for not wanted to live in a house covered in fecal and piss matter.

Somehow, it’s me stressing him out and not being obsessed with qanon. My mom just wants to keep the peace and doesn’t defend me for my father accusing me of causing his heart attack. She’s not a qanon shithead but she’s super conservative and loves Trump.

342,"The longer I stay on here, the more I know he’s never coming back.","I originally joined this sub around October after I was recommended by someone on a different sub. At first, all I could think is “thank God, I’m not alone, there’s other people dealing with this as well”, but the longer I stay and read story after story I just see and feel such absolute hopelessness. 
The rare cases where people “unpill” themselves is due to it contradicting some of their previous belief systems in some way, but that involves having the previous knowledge in the first place. Everything we say (my gran who’s a doctor, my mother who’s a nurse, my brother who’s a physicist etc.) we’re told that it’s not true or we’re uneducated and honestly I’m done believing they’ll ever be any kind of change. It’s honestly depressing how I used to think of myself as trying to be as unbiased as I could possibly be, but now, even at the mention of someone liking Trump or believing any conspiracy theory makes me squirm and instantly think they’re a terrible person like my Q-person and I hate that I’ve become this person who instantaneously thinks like this.
I want success for everyone who’s affected, but it’s not gonna happen for mine and at this point, from a month ago, I just don’t talk to them anymore or even look at them in the eyes (there’s just too many things said, too many things done for me to be okay with communicating with them).",QAnonCasualties

345,Need advice about a conspiracy theorist friend and whether or not I should cut him off,"This has been on my mind a lot recently and given the fact that most of my friends dislike the friend in question, well call him “N”, I figured Reddit would be good for unbiased advice. I’ve been friends with him my entire life. We’re both 22 and met when we were babies at his moms daycare. Our friendship growing up was great, although we went to different high schools, we still hung out often and enjoyed each others company. He was always “the weird kid” but never in a malicious way, he was just a strange guy in general. Growing up and for the majority of high school he was just a funny, goofy dude who was always fun to be around and a loyal friend. 

Things started to change around 2016 if I’m remembering right. Throughout high school and to this day I have several different friend groups and a wide array of friends from different walks of life. I’m friends with self described radial leftists and the friend in question who I would describe as a religious fundamentalist conspiracy theorist. In high school he got much closer to his own small friend group which consisted of very socially awkward gamer dudes who exhibited a lot of sexist and homophobic behaviour, but to be honest nothing out of the norm for high school boys. I was also friends with these guys but as time went on I only remained friends with N mostly because of our childhood bond. 

Just to clarify I don’t want this post to become political, I’m genuinely looking for unbiased advice here, but I do have to make note of our political differences and how they’ve impacted our friendship. 

Around 2016 when Trump got elected he started sharing conspiracy theories with myself and our friend group at the time. It started with offhand comments and eventually became him just constantly bombarding us with conspiracies which lead to constant arguments. His relationship with some of that friend group slowly dissipated with time but even with our disagreements and arguing we remained friends. 

Things started to get even worse around two years ago when he slowly turned into a fundamentalist Christian seemingly out of nowhere. (He claims he’s always been Christian but never mentioned it before 2018ish) He became super judgmental of myself and all our friends for not aligning with his personal values. “Gay jokes” that seemed innocent enough in high school became genuine homophobia that LGBT friends of ours have told me is the reason they’re no longer friends with him. Saying the N word in high school (he is white) turned into genuine racist tendencies and to this day in 2021 he uses the N word with a hard R constantly, even though he’s been told it’s not ok by everyone around him. I could go on but to keep it as short as I can he has slowly changed from a goofy, weird, but fun guy into a racist, sexist, homophobic, and generally unpleasant person to be around. The last straw for me recently was hearing from his sister boyfriend that his dad had been exposed to covid at work and while the rest of his family was quarantining he was still inviting friends over secretly and potentially exposing his family to covid. He is also an anti vaxxer which is going to be a big problem for me when the vaccine eventually rolls out.

What made me start writing this is after me begging him to stop sending conspiracy theories, he sent an especially stupid one to a group chat, I told him to stop sending them and that it’s insane to believe it, and he blocked me on all social media. By and large despite our differences he has been a good friend to me. He’s been there for me during very hard times and I have been very mean to him a lot of times in the past mostly due to our differences and handled situations wrong plenty of times. He’s helped me move a million times, driven me everywhere cause I don’t drive and helped out my mother with chores cause he lives in the same town as her and I do not. It hurts to say but I’m very much considering cutting him off until (or if) he changes. I just need advice because I’m very conflicted and hurt right now. Any and all advice is welcome, cheers.",QAnonCasualties
346,What’s a good way to find out without sounding judgmental?,My sister has been distant since we argued about Bill Gates back when Covid first started. I’m worried I may have made her shut down but I want to know before it gets worse or figure out if her boyfriend is feeding her this stuff.

349,This is why it is so unlikely we will get our loved ones back.,"When I first started reading about Qanon two things struck me. 1. The sheer number of theories that seemed to conveniently explain pretty much anything they wanted to believe (i.e. coronavirus being a hoax, global warming not being real, the Jewish deep state) and 2. The number of people who believed in Q-related theories who also did not actually know about Q/4chan/Qanon/The Storm at all. I found it interesting that I could talk to my relatives, who did not know about Qanon and have never been on or heard of any of the Q drops spout out beliefs that were clearly started in Qanon message board sites. Additionally, I was struck by how every single thing that Qanons saw as negative was connected to the Deep State Conspiracy, and posters who were not Q just sorta posted theories that strangers on the internet just believed.

Functionally, I get how it’s happening. The theory starts on Q message boards and gains traction, then gets picked up by conservative “news sources” on Facebook which omits the Q-origin of the article and rebrand it as news. So now, even my 78 year old Aunt would repost a fully Q-conspiracy theory on Facebook without knowing it came from Qanon. I think it has infiltrated the Republican party so handily that way. 

Another thing was the impossibility that people actually cared about the victims of the cabal, who apparently are children. Because if you truly cared and believed that a secret cabal was eating children then why the hell would you “Trust the plan,” and “Hold the line,” and just watch inane YouTube videos for proof of the conspiracy? The people who follow these theories appear to want to believe one thing: **That Donald Trump is the right, and should/will be president for another 4+ years or forever**. They will think anything to justify this belief, even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

This is just a natural progression of a ""party"" that lost its moral compass a long time ago. Many Republicans have been primed to believe conspiracies for decades and that this is nothing new for the GOP. This is not to say the Democratic Party is perfect, certainly it is not, and there have been morally bankrupt politicians on both sides (which I am sure Q people WILL LET YOU KNOW).

I am sure that anyone interested in this topic is interested in cognitive dissonance and moving the goal posts so I will not go over it again. But, remember that these are important in understanding the GOP today.

First, a brief history of the GOP since the 1960’s is important (and I would recommend, It Was All a Lie by Stuart Stevens and It’s Even Worst than it Looks by Ornstein and Mann and Why the Right Went Wrong by EJ Dionne Jr).

Basically, since Barry Goldwater’s campaign (and the Civil Rights movement), the GOP has just not attracted Black voters. Why? **Because Black voters tend to understand how to vote in their self-interest**. And in the 60s, during the Civil Rights movement, the interests of Black voters were pretty obvious. The Republican Party, particularly Goldwater, had started preaching for States’ rights and a small government when, for instance, 20,000 National Guard members had to be sent to the University of Alabama for it to be safe for Black students.

Instead of attempting to win back Black voters, the Republican Party targeted working class white voters, particularly in the South. This was especially evident in the campaign of Barry Goldwater, who campaigned on a platform of individualism and anti-Communism. He won the nomination, but lost the election by a landslide, but managed to flip five southern states red with his stance against federal enforcement of the Civil Rights Act. Since the 1960’s the South has been overwhelmingly red. 

The GOP then made an effort to target “working class” white voters, preferably very religious and without a college education. In the 1980’s and 1990’s, especially with Reagan, the party targeted Evangelical Christians, with dogmatic hardlines against LGBTQ rights and abortion. But Evangelical Christians were not made republican through Roe v. Wade or a particular culture war...This is a fallacy of our modern times. It was a case called Green v. Conolly, which held that segregated Christian schools (such as Jerry Falwell's) could not have tax exempt status because by default, discriminatory schools, by definition, were not charitable organizations. It is a holding that makes a lot of sense, but made racist Evangelicals very angry and involved them in politics**. Evangelical organizations started up with nationalistic views and got involved in politics under the guise of being against secular culture. This was not because culture got too sexual, but because it got too integrated.** 

But then, something very curious happened. Evangelicals and Republicans at large voted for Reagan, a divorced California actor, over Jimmy Carter, a Sunday school teacher who read the Bible daily. This makes evangelical support for Trump unsurprising to say the least. People think Pence swayed evangelicals and I am sure they did not. 

The Reagan era was situated on flimsy economic theories and odd anecdotes. The oddest one being ""The Welfare Queen."" The Welfare Queen was a real person, named Linda Taylor. Taylor was a career criminal, kidnapper, and likely a murderer who was racially ambiguous and mostly white-passing. But Reagan described her in coded language ""a woman from the southside of Chicago"" who stole $150,000 in welfare. In reality, she stole $40,000 from welfare fraud but was only charged with $8,000. People assumed she was a Black woman, and she was, but she was able to impersonate Hispanic, Jewish, and Asian women in her schemes. Reagan, instead of framing this as a wacky one-off story (which it was) implied it was an example of a systemic problem.

\*Another more recent anecdote has been the Kate Steinle case, which Trump mentioned, which mirrors the ""Welfare Queen"" Reagan stuff. A five-time-deportee, a Mexican man, shot and killed a white woman in San Francisco, which was a sanctuary city. The perpetrator,  José Inez García Zárate, was found not guilty of murder because he literally picked up a gun he found and shot it. He was also found to be a paranoid schizophrenic and a vagrant who was frequently in trouble with the law. Why was he so hard to deport permanently? Well, he did not stay anywhere permanently and had few, if any, associates or family. Zarate was not a typical Mexican, not a typical migrant, and by definition of being severely mentally ill not a typical person. But that never reached the ears of Trump supporters who think that a liberal California jury insanely decided not to charge this man with murder, and that this was apparently endemic of a larger problem. It is not. 

Conservative strategy really ramped up with Newt Gingrich who started this whole ""win at all costs"" strategy. Gingrich, a very sorely mentally disturbed individual decided that winning was the new Republican strategy in congress. McConnell has followed this lead into today. But...that's not even the point. ***The point is that voting Republican is essentially voting for an opposition party.*** Like baseball fans that just want the Yankees to lose, the Republican party would grasp at anything to defeat Democrats. Unfortunately the ""Yankees"" in this case are a properly funded federal government. What you get when your platform is loosely ""small government"" is ""shitty government."" And that's what we have now. 

And this includes distorted facts about climate change, social issues, COVID, etc. People are groomed into these beliefs for a variety of reasons. But the thing is that they have been groomed for many years. And communities have been groomed. So, if you have been denying climate change for your entire life, with the mounting evidence and support for it from, well, the entire World, it is easier to believe that the World has some messed up deep state. **But even larger than that, if you are voting in such a way that necessarily goes against your own interests, then that creates a psychological (see cognitive dissonance theory) need for mental gymnastics, false justifications, and ""alternative facts"" .** And people have been doing mental gymnastics in regard to politics since the 60s. It doesn't matter if your Q person became a republican yesterday, the fact is that we have just accepted this as a fact of American life in both parties. 

All Americans are told to ""reach across the aisle,"" to ""consider other people's opinions."" This is a form of gaslighting. Have you had a feeling that the Republican party was ""racisty"" and nonsensical for a while? (Because it is.) But then, even people on the left are telling you to compromise? I think most people have. Being on the left  means you have been intensely gaslighted into thinking you are on some sort of equal playing field with a loose political strategy to win/get money. 

Think about abortion. If a person really considered it a genocide of babies, if you really thought it was murder, a violent act, then why involve your own young children in it, as many anti-choice people do? If you thought it was *murder* why sit outside abortion clinics essentially doing nothing? Because human beings have a gut instinct about what murder is and what isn't, and it simply doesn't hit us because we know it's not murder. I know there are a few nutjobs but the vast majority of anti-choice people out there say it's murder, compare it to the Holocaust, and then go about your lives living normally with this massecre apparently going on. So, youre saying if you believed the HOLOCAUST were happening you'd just sit around reposting Facebook articles? 

It's the same thing with Qanon. If you think the deep state were killing children, why would you just sit around on the computer? Why do nothing? Why ""Hold the line""? Why ""Trust the plan""? Because they have been groomed to deal with ""outrage"" this way. Because of predatory politics. Because of an opposition party that has taken over half the country. Because if you admit this is wrong, then you would admit that you have been wrong, your parents were wrong, etc. Qanon did not just ""start"" three years ago. It's been baking in the Republican oven for decades, which is why it won't just go away. The trouble for me is that it's becoming increasingly enmeshed. 

The best thing to do? Not sure. People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to double down when presented with facts. So your loved one will not just see the ""light of day"" by you telling them the facts. Truthfully, **I think the best course of action is to cut off contact until you feel psychologically safe around your Q person.** Do I love my Dad? Yes. Are we good having a conversation right now without me wanting to punch a wall? No. Hell no. 

**Tl; dr Most Q's have been groomed for their entire lifetime for this, because most Americans have been groomed for half a century into thinking the Republican Party is reasonable or stands for anything other than defunding the government where it wants to. Deprogramming would be difficult/impossible. We need to disengage with our**",QAnonCasualties
350,I'm afraid for my friend...it may be too late,"One of my very good friends is simply one of the most brilliant people I know.  I had hoped that her smarts and natural skepticism would somehow innoculate her from this Q stuff.  She moved back to TX three years ago and has sort of backslid away from reality.

A few key points....already a Libertarian, rabid gun owner, bi-polar and has severe trust issues.  I have made myself absolutely available to her to talk about family etc. as her family is going through a rough Alzheimers time.  I've been her friend through drug overdoses, attempted suicide and involuntary commitment.  Also feverish Christianity swinging back to profound athieism.

I finally drew the line when she went off on a gigantic screed on FB tackling everything from March 4 to WWG1WGA.  Im luckily removed physically from her, but she is starting to socially distance herself from me now too.  I HAVE probably been wrong to just dismiss her with ""I see you've taken another step into conspiracy land.  I'm not going to take a part in this.""

352,"Debating bringing up why I unfriended my Q sibling now that she added me back, but I don’t know if it’s worth it.","As is the case for many here, my sibling’s descent into the Q world was a drastic left turn from who they once were. It was very uncomfortable and even devastating for me to see the things she said and posted last year because she seemed brainwashed and like she’d passed the point of no return. Because it was too hard for me, and I determined I wouldn’t be friends with someone like that if they weren’t my family, I treated her the same way as I would non-family and removed her from my friends list in December. 

She had created a new account (which we were previously friends on) but evidently when she saw me pop up as a suggested FB friend, she thought she had simply forgotten to add me on her new account, so she messaged me about that and sent a friend request. Thinking/hoping that maybe she became one of the people who turned a new leaf once “the storm” didn’t happen on 1/6, I figured I would accept her request and check out her page. Her page is set to private, so I couldn’t check in advance to see if she has still been posting about Q things. I accepted it, went to her page, and immediately regretted the decision. Nothing changed. 

I want to respond to her “add meeeee!! :)))))))” message and say the real reason why we weren’t friends on FB, mainly because so long as she doesn’t know I have such a problem with it, she’ll continue to interact with me as though everything is normal, and there is just no way I’m going to be able to look past that giant of an elephant in the room. So there’s that, but at the same time, I highly doubt my expressing disapproval for her being involved in this cult is going to make her reconsider her affiliation with them, and it’s just going to drive a very real wedge into a relationship that was very important and dear to me throughout my childhood.

354,He started in anti vax/anti science and its led him into Q territory. Is it too late or is there hope?,"My brother 45M has always been more, “free spirited.” He moved to LA and got a little more “crunchy.” In the last year, he has done a deep dive into conspiracy theories. It started with COVID is a hoax, it’s a ploy from big pharma to make money, and so on. Now, it seems that the rhetoric he is spouting is deeply crossed with the Q bs I’ve seen. He is talking about how the PCR test is fake, all of the science is biased and then sends me videos (which always get taken down, OR they ask for your personal info or money in order to see them...like how is that not obvious?) and says “you see, here is proof.” 

It’s even more painful because I am a scientist. I’m a preventative medicine phd candidate. My life is dedicated to research...And he won’t believe me. He says everything I’m learning is fake. And that even my studies have been falsely guided (like even results somehow?) by higher powers. It makes no sense. 

When he brings me something easily debunkable, and I show him that eg RNA doesn’t work like that or whatever, he just says, “it’s too bad that they’re not teaching you the reality.” And gives me a sad look. This is incredibly frustrating. It’s like if I said, the sky is blue, it’s known to be blue, it’s demonstrably blue, but he says no, it’s not, it’s red. Like how can I give him info if he won’t even accept basic info as correct?

So with him being at this level of non acceptance, is there any way to save him? I don’t think he realizes this anti science is Q territory. He used to hate trump but now I don’t even know. I don’t want to ask. With the 2016 election he was so upset when Bernie lost, he said he would rather vote trump than Clinton, if that is an indicator. 

Is it too late? Or has he already been programmed? Others have already tried and he just gets on an hour long rant about the “truth.”  He berated our mom for getting her covid vaccine. He has yelled at our family members (who are mostly in the health care industry) for spreading fake news about covid and helping big pharma. This is insulting to them, because they’re exhausted already from working in an environment that has been so hard hit by covid.

It's either Qanon, pyramid schemes, flat earth, anti-vax, or all of the above. Just getting worse and worse. I can't have any normal conversations with them. I don't look forward to seeing them as I have to be careful what I say. I have my wife and young son to worry about so I'm keeping them away from this insanity. It just makes me kind of sad. I don't know how they fell for all this stuff. I thought they were smart. 

I think it's their way of dealing with trauma and personal failure. Makes them feel like it's not actually their own fault for the situation they're in. Like someone else is secretly in control and they can scapegoat the mystery shadow forces that only the ""woke"" people understand. It's pathetic.

Thankfully I have a good support network in my friends and co-workers. My wife sees what they're doing too so no problems at home. 

I just wish they could be normal. I want to talk about science, and space, and climate change, and making things better ffs! Not hear about how, ""oh just wait, something's happening"". It's all so backwards. I have to not think about them much because it makes me angry.

356,I miss my old mom,"I have struggled with writing this for so long. I feel like my heart and spirit are completely broken. I am so thankful that I found this thread - it makes me feel like I am not alone in this. 

Ever since last March, when covid really hit, my mother has been transforming. To be honest I am not sure if she considers herself a part of Q, but she holds all of their beliefs. We have had countless arguments where I am literally begging her to just stop talking about it. She believes she is “awakened” and the rest of us (the family) are still sleeping. I am so exhausted of trying to nudge her back to reality. She believes in the great awakening, Trump is here to save us, you cannot watch/trust ANY news channel (all fake news), the Clinton’s/Obama’s/Biden’s are evil beings (not even human) Tom Hanks and most of Hollywood are part of the pedo ring, covid is not real (she refuses to wear a mask), among much more.

She tells me I cannot face the truth of what is happening in the world. She cannot be reasoned with and is always telling me to “do my research” when I try to use facts or logic to prove her wrong. It is so, so frustrating and depressing. 

Despise me asking her many, many times to just not discuss it, she simply cannot help it. This has led me to the difficult decision to take a step back and not speak to her until I feel I am ready. This makes me feel guilty and also the fact that my brothers are telling me to just “make up with her and move on”. When she goes on her rants, they just listen and agree to avoid any type of conflict. To me, this is what made her so bad. I don’t want to do that anymore, and maybe it is wrong, but I can’t take it. It’s hard to have a relationship with her and it’s also hard not to. This is so difficult and I’m just so angry that it has come to this.

357,Hopefully some helpful resources?,"Hey everyone, 

As some of you may know if you've read previous posts of mine, I've lost folks to Q and I do sexual violence prevention and support work. I've been personally digging into street epistemology and other deprogramming techniques and professionally digging into combating misinformation in the sexual violence field.

I figured this info could be helpful for folks if they have QPeople who focus on the trafficking portion and if they're not too far down the rabbit hole. (I think the webinar itself is interesting but I wouldn't necessarily share it with any Qpeople).

358,"Not sure if they are Q, but they are not the same","I'm so glad to find a place like this and see that I'm not alone. I knew I wasn't alone. but still. seeing others and reading other's experiences helps. It's my parents (in their 80s). Both trumpers, they have been republican for as long as I can remember. And really, once I left home I gave it little thought. I knew we had some fundamental differences about what we think but that divide has gotten wider. I used to feel like I was a middle of the road sort of person, could see valid points on both sides, all that. But through the years I've leaned further and further to the left. Though my Dad will still say that 'Once I'm older I'll be a republican'. My reply is 'Dad, I'm in my 40s. I think you should let that go now'.

Several years ago, I had to move back home. I had lost my apartment through a nasty breakup, and had decided to go back to school. It was hard to move back in my 30s, but ultimately it was helpful. I could work part time, and at some point just do school full time and get myself on a better life track. I was living there during the 2016 election. Fox news on every TV in the house, rush limbaugh on the radio in the AM. I kept most of my opinions to myself, and made it a point to educate my son about critical thinking and that you have to do the research, you can't believe everything on TV, especially on a channel that is all opinions. It's not news then. I rooted for the Democrats, they rooted for the republicans. I told them that trump's build the wall was racist, and that racism is wrong. That his attitude about women was disgusting and no one should support that. Dad felt emboldened at the grocery store to comment loudly about Latinex people and their children. When confronted he said ""I'm too old to change"" I said that was BS and a copout.  In the end the emotional abuse that I grew up with began to spill over to my son when Mom told me she was withholding affection from him till he cleaned his room. Then backpaddled and tried to deny it when I told her she was being emotionally abusive to her grandson. I moved him out and to his Dad's place that weekend. I stayed. for a while. I tried to reason, use logic, get mad, argue and finally I gave up and I left. I lived at a friends place, rented space in her living room. Just to get away from the endless barrage of bs.

I thank my lucky stars that Mom never figured out how to use Facebook. She had asked me to set one up for her, I told her no, if she wanted one she had to figure it out herself. Mostly because they treat me as their built in tech support, I'm not going to sign up for FB support too. But she did find NewsMax, she said ""I like what they say better than Fox, something is wrong with Fox"" (this was around the time that Fox was criticizing trump) I would tell her that you are not supposed to like what you hear in the news, it's news, not a fantasy story. Also around that time she would call me, and for an hour she would talk about the Dems manipulating things and making things up about trump. I would disagree. try to fact check her, but the amount of lies were overwhelming and it's hard to do it in real time. I finally made a rule with her, a boundary that I no longer wanted to talk about politics, religion or my weight. To say in short, Mom is not good at respecting boundaries. I would steer the convo back to safe topics, but she always had to get her jab in. Tell me to not 'fall for the spin' I had friends participating in the BLM protests. Getting pepper sprayed for standing and holding signs. I watched the live streams and heard their stories. But to her they were all Antifa terrorists. I told her that all that they are trying to do, is stop the inequalities. Bring attention to an issue that is very real. But it does not fit into her narrative, therefore, I am the one that has been mislead. I'm believing the lies. 

Then I decided that I would only Email with her, no more calls. No more visits. It was too much for me to handle. I started going to therapy. Watching her go down this rabbit hole, believing everything that trump would say. Her emails also got hostile and cold. she would not respond for days and days when I had said something she didn't like or something that rubbed her the wrong way.. punishing me.  I made it clear. You don't have to write me long letters, but I need to know you are okay, I have power of attorney and I need to know that you are both safe and staying healthy. Mom is more worried about Covid, I got to her early and told her to listen to Fauci, listen to the CDC. Dad, not such a big believer, will wear a mask but thinks it's all overblown. 

I refuse to talk with them about what happened at the capitol. The only thing that has been said was after the election, after the insurgency, Mom telling me she is worried about what is happening in the country. Worried about what is going to happen. I agreed, and backed it up with telling her that there are a lot of extremists and that they should be held accountable for their actions, particularly considering what they did at the capitol. I don't think we were talking about the same groups of people. 

So is it Q..? I'm not sure, I've lost the people I once knew and loved. Their limited knowledge of the internet seems to have played in my favor here, I think. But Mom had not been sharing things with me from her Email for a long time, so I worry that she could be in deeper than I realize. I do know they are not the parents I once knew, not anymore. Not for quite a while now. It used to really bother me, now I feel mostly numb with moments of intense emotion about it. I'm just glad to see that I'm not alone.

I'm not senile, I don't have dementia, Alzheimer's or memory loss but if you ask my oldest son, you'd think I have them all as these are just a few of the awful names he calls me.  He hid it from me that he was going to vote for T in 2016 for as long as he could but I'm good at smelling a rat.   It began an over 4 year long battle between us as I am a progressive Democrat and my son hates Bernie Sanders as he believes socialism is a dirty word.  When COVID hit the USA, my son was buying into Qanon BS and believed it was a hoax as his dictator told him so.   I have not seen he or his wife and kids since Xmas 2019 and it was very stressful.  None will wear a mask and I have cancer as well as old age.   I'm unafraid to tell it like it is so after walking on eggshells for months, trying to reason with him, sending him correct and truthful information he wouldn't even look at or read and getting nothing but very mean and ugly reactions, I resorted to dropping one word TRUTH BOMBS.   I'd just say, Dump Trump or Drop the cult meaning Qanon.   Now my son also has cancer and is undergoing chemo and radiation, I stopped mentioning anything other than his health.

I dismissed it as nonsense because the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine works the same as a flu vaccine does, it's not changing your genome at all but she hinted this doctor said it changes your genome.

another thing she's freaking out about is the adenovirus comes from chimpanzees

she just keeps going around watching these weird videos and quanon-esque stuff too

UPDATE !!

saw the video. The doctor was saying in the video she showed on her phone that the COVID vaccine causes ''non neutralizing antibodies'' to only be produced, causing antibody-dependent enhancement, so when vaccinated people get COVID 6 months later, they'll all die because the antibodies from the vaccine will eat their lungs and attack their white blood cells.",QAnonCasualties

369,Pretty much lost my father to this,"For months I've listened to baseless claims from my father on different political topics, where things started getting so heated that politics of any kind were banned in the house.  We just had the worst fight of our lives and I feel lost.  He got into all of this because he fell for some Iraqi Dinar scam a few years back that he bought into believing it will make rich.  I never paid much attention to it, as other than the initial couple hundreds he lost ""investing"", he never paid anything else.  Fast forward to last year, and I'm hearing him talk about things like Tom Hanks being a pedophile and how Joe Biden will be arrested before the 20th of January regardless if he won the election or not....which he staunchly claims he didn't still.  


Now he is full into the belief still that the election was stolen, that Joe Biden is not the president, as we are ""under martial law"" and the government is actually ran by ""General McInerney"" (I think I spelt that correctly).  Everything I try to say or show to him just gets tempers (both of ours) rising, and no matter what I try to show him, he counters it with ""evidence"" from the ""research"" he's done.  Even asking him to just stop watching the various videos that he's watching is met with a scream that he won't because he is a ""patriot"", and doesn't want ""communist China"" to take control.  He doesn't even care at the friends and family he is losing over this because ""if they were my friends, they'd accept I have different beliefs than they might have"", despite at the same time saying things like ""you are an idiot if you honestly believe Biden won"".

Thankfully I haven’t lost anyone yet but I’ve noticed something and haven’t heard it mentioned much on here or shows about Q-Anon so I thought I would throw it out there to get some people’s opinions about it. 

In most instances of relationships where domestic violence or mental abuse occurs, one of the first things that the abuser does is cut the victim off from family and friends so they don’t have a support system and so that the only truth can come from the abuser. 

I have to think that this is the reason behind Trump’s “fake news” and derision of the MSM campaign. Basically, I believe it was designed to alienate people from sources of news that were reliable. Once they had that void opened up, they had to fill it with something. And unfortunately, with a little nudging from Trump and Fox News, this is the rabbit hole they ran down. 

Obviously I’m no therapist, but this whole thing looks exactly like an abusive relationship. I don’t know that even if I’m right it offers any help as when how to help people who have bought into the conspiracy hook, line, and sinker but I thought I’d throw it out there.",QAnonCasualties

374,No end in sight,"I've posted here before, I am dealing with members of my family that are immersed in all things Qanon. One of my parents is the worst offender. We've had some pretty horrible arguments about their beliefs, spreading of misinformation and absolutely terrifying me with the ideas they have embraced.

I recently had to go home for a family emergency and spent almost a month being exposed to daily rants and pontifications over the theories my parent thinks are fact. They claim Fox News is watered down nonsense yet it ran, at volume, all day, every day. My parent would sit glued to their phone and laptop, wearing headphones and fixating on videos and forum threads/posts. There were times over my time there that I was clenching my teeth so hard to keep from screaming that my jaw would ache at night when I would finally try to sleep. In less than a week I was dealing with daily headaches, stomach upset and mentally felt like I was teetering right the edge of throwing a full on rage filled fit complete with visions of smashing furniture.

The worst recent topic is the Covid-19 vaccination and how members of my family truly, honestly, deeply believe that the vaccine is made up of literally ground up aborted babies. And, if you receive the vaccine you are not only injecting pure satanic death into your body, it is again all a hoax to hoodwink people into getting injected with tracking devices. No amount of showing proof on any level penetrates their barrier of brainwashing, believe me I tried.

Other long winded tirades in my time there were about the insurrection in DC (Fake, that was Antifa) and how the people that died were paid crisis actors. Also, as Americans it is our *right* to storm federal buildings and demand the the evil satanic cabal running this country be called to account, violently, if need be, people are sheep!

Holy freaking hell, I thought it was bad before, it is now so much worse. Especially since everyone in my family who had gone off into the Q weeds found themselves banned from Twitter, dislocated when Parler went away and now can't seem to get Gab to work with any amount of reliability. I have no idea where they were spending their days shouting into the void, but somehow they are still finding places to receive and share this incredible amount of misinformation. 

I have tried to hard to be optimistic about this running its course with them but I honestly don't see it happening. The hooks of this madness are sunk deep and even if whoever was or is behind Q is no longer posting, this thing has self-sustaining momentum now. I have to come to terms with the fact that I have lost them, they aren't coming back and even when they seem ""normal"" in conversations the crazy is just right there under the surface waiting to spring out and ruin everything. And they don't care because they think they are right. The internet/Q/YouTube/Random crazy a$$hole online said so, it's a fact and the MSM is wrong/evil/satanic/controlling our minds.

386,I Didn't Even Know It Was The Problem,"My relationship with my Mom wasn't the best at the dawn of 2020, but we were both feeling like we were both making an effort. August of 2020 is the beginning of the time I can actually track with text messages, phone calls and emails. Things looked idyllic. We were finally communicating in a non-toxic way. It was all ""I understand and I love you"" and streams of loving emojis. We talked about how happy we were that we were muddling through figuring out what a relationship between the two of us was like with me being an adult now. She told me how proud she was of me, I told her I really appreciated her understanding while I was figuring things out.

In October she watched Plandemic and wanted me to watch as well. I warned her against it, that it has been throughly debunked. She claimed the scientists behind it were well respected and world renowned. I told her that wasn't true, but I would watch it and get back to her. I couldn't get through the first 20 mins, and I didn't know how to say that. She didn't ask.

Over the next couple months she would send me weird/random text messages with no explaination. When I asked her what they were she would say ""Oh, I just thought it was interesting."" Shit like that Fauci was Mother Teresa's secret son, but Mother Teresa was really a man who was a pedophile. Bill Gates is putting microchips in the covid vaccines and it's the number of the beast.

Every time I would try to appear open minded and non-judgemental. I'd ask her what she thought of that and why she felt it was true. ""It's interesting."" Is all I got back.

December rolls around and it starts getting weirder. She texted this weird bit of disjointed text that makes no sense to me, my Fiance and his parents that was talking about how the Covid body count is not only fabricated, but because QAnon people are requiring ""actual proof"", it's coming out that ""they're"" ""actually murdering"" people to make their ""covid quotas"". She sent me more stupid videos that were obviously bunk, and I sat down in front of them ready to puzzle and write it out. Within 3 minutes there was TOO MANY LIES for me to keep going. I couldn't fathom trying to debunk 90 mins of this. I was overwhelmed. I was secure in what she had told me about us being patient with each other and valuing our relationship.

I made a really dumb mistake. I didn't know how serious it was. She's never been into politics my whole life. She hates technology like smart phones and calls herself a ""techy rebel"" because she knows so little about social media and computers. I thought she was safe. 

I started ignoring the stuff she was sending me and asking for ""my opinion"". There were a couple things she sent I knew were bunk and told her so, but instead of all that about respecting and wanting my opinion, she got mad.

When we spoke before Christmas, she made it clear she didn't think Covid was a real thing anymore. All I could think of was continuing to diffuse the situation and not ruining her holiday.

Shortly after that she ""randomly"" blew up at me about how I was ungrateful. A few days after that, same thing. I didn't make the connection then, but she had sent me QShit, and I had just carried on ignoring it. A few days after this she looses her mind at me over the fact that if she wants me to forgive her, and her flying monkey, they need to apologize, and uninvites me from her upcoming wedding because I'm ""being disrespectful"" and I'm not ""acting right"".

About a week after that I reach out again asking about the wedding, being positive and upbeat. I get back 5 pictures QDrops and news articles she'd really horribly screenshot with no explaination, 2 of her in her wedding dress, and the message ""excited for the wedding"". Within 5 texts she decides that I'm not acting right and snaps at me. I respond with boundaries, and she looses her mind and ""leaves"". So in her mind we're not talking because she's punishing me, but in reality, I'm done. This Q shit + her usual abusive, narcissistic, selfish, bullshit is too much for fucking anyone.

She blocked me on FB ages ago, but I made a new account to look and QShit is EVERYWHERE on her FB staring early December. I didn't understand so many times why she was so upset when we would talk, but it lines up with when she would send me this Qcrap and I'd ignore it. I had said I'd watch whatever, and I would, but she expected immediate results, and would guilt trip me when I hadn't watched whatever she'd asked after 6 hrs, so I wasn't interested anymore.

By the time I finally realized, (late Dec) I would say it was too late if she hadn't continued responded to my sound debunking of her BS with ""I just thought it was interesting, no big deal."" It had been too late and I missed it.

I'm sorry if this is disjointed or all over the place, I'm still figuring things out. I'm sure this all makes it sound and look obvious, but I can't stress how much it wasn't at the time. I just don't know how I missed it. I hope this helps anyone.

You make a solid point or they don't have any real knowledge of it. They gish gallop.","The Gish gallop is a rhetorical technique that involves overwhelming your opponent with as many arguments as possible, with no regard for the accuracy, validity, or relevance of those arguments.

Generalized and unsubstantiated claims that are difficult to refute. For example: “I saw that several recently published papers disproved global warming, so clearly many scientists don’t believe that it’s real”. 

Anecdotal statements with little to no value. For example: “you keep saying that global temperatures are rising, but my town got a lot of snow last week”.

Intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of truthful facts. For example “there is a lot of debate and disagreement in the scientific community regarding whether or not there is global warming”.

389,What is probability my husband will come back to reality?,"I just joined this group after seeing on 60 Minutes. I am happy to find this but now think I could turn into my husband with my head in my phone except over the opposite side of Q beliefs. Essentially my 3 teens would now be losing both their parents over 2 different sides of the same issue. Does anyone else feel that way?
I feel sick &amp; sad over this and don't think I am up to the challenge of learning about how to interact with someone taken over by these beliefs and bringing him back from the dark side. What are the stats on this being successful?
I had separated from him a few years back due to it not being a healthy relationship. But I came back home after 1.5 years away, as my heart broke watching my kids traipse back and forth between 2 ""homes"", then 1.5 years later covid hits and now my husband has gone off the deep end. I have a counselor but maybe need someone who specializes in conspiracy theories. 
I almost think I have to ignore this side of him; he gets that I don't like his beliefs (nor does he like my mainstream beliefs). I told him the other night we can't talk about this stuff and remain married and he said then we won't stay married! He said he would leave as I told him that I don't have it in me to move out again. So far he is still here and I don't think he is leaving soon as things have settled down. We cannot talk about these differences and I feel that is safest even if I feel like I am keeping my head in the sand.
Does anyone else feel like this; that in the best interest of the marriage and family it is better to ignore this aspect to the best of our ability? I don't have the time or energy to learn all that is required to help him escape from his rabbit hole (not that he is asking for help to be free). 
There just seems to be no good solution here.",QAnonCasualties

391,"This is what my pilled BFF is sharing with my family, friends etc 🤦🏽‍♀️","After this was shared with me by a friend (I’ve blocked by BFF on everything for my own peace so I don’t see it first hand)... I had a revelation. 

If I met this person now, without our 35 year history, we would not be friends. 

I’ve been struggling with my decision to shut it down... and when I realized this, I also had to recognize that the person I love is probably not coming back. If she does, I’ll be here... for her. But I doubt that I will ever trust her to be my person and BFF again. It would take a lot. 

Here is the BS she is sharing with my Dad (he’s all in... *sigh*) and more... she’s a recruiter and it makes my heart hurt.💔

“Info shared is from US Military Intelligence sources. Info also from Dr. Charlie Ward  &amp; Simon Parks, from their US Military Intel that they receive and share through videos on Rumble &amp; Bitchute - as YouTube removes all their videos. 

Yes, many people arrested for satanic worship, child sex abuse &amp; adrenochrome, child sacrifice; crimes against humanity. Also for treason &amp; sedition to try to overthrow our govt. Military Tribunals at GITMO with evidence of crimes, sentencing; and depending on guilty verdict, executions. 

God’s Almighty Plan, carried out by God fearing Patriots (love of God, love of country, respect for our Constitution which is based on God’s Word &amp; principles).

It Is Done.  The Deep State collapses.  

 The official announcement of martial law and a legitimate military government, in effect since 12:00 AM on January 20, 2021, was made on Friday, January 29 at 6:00 PM EST (11:00 PM GMT).

 The official announcement of Biden's arrest along with 355 congressmen and 109 senators (464 elected) on January 24 and 25 was made on Sunday, January 31 at 4:35 PM EST (10:35 PM GMT - 11:35 PM Amsterdam / Brussels  / Paris).

 These announcements were made on the dates and hours above to all American media (televisions, radios and national newspapers) and to all world news outlets.

 As expected by the legitimate military government that runs America, as well as Trump and Qforce, this information was 100% censored by all official world media. The US military government knew this and wanted it that way.

 As with Biden and his party's coup d'état, the legitimate US government is allowing the US media to commit widespread treason by having them censor the legitimate government's official statements about measures of national security and immediate danger to the American nation.

 The media have all fallen into a trap. Now the legitimate military government can take over (provisional) control of all such media as dictated by law and the US Constitution. 🇺🇸”

393,conservatism and trump took my family and ruined my life,"was told i should post this here

my mom started off pretty normal. she was always a little crazy. she had a really fucked up childhood and my dad wasnt the greatest guy so she's pretty traumatized. around 2014/2015 she started making youtube videos. she became part of the youtuber skeptic community and started really diving deep into politics, MAGA, all that. she wholeheartedly supported trump and believed every word he and his supporters said. it has only gotten worse. she doesn't seem to understand that the things she's saying dont make any sense anymore. just today she tried to tell me theres a secret government op to ""own the weather"" and control it and thinks whats happening in texas is on purpose to punish the state for voting red. she's not my mom anymore. i cant talk to her about anything that isnt politics. and im not one to argue. im almost the complete opposite of her but i never say anything because i dont want to have to sit and argue. i wish someone could get through to her but she just thinks everyone is an idiot and shes the only smart one. its killing me to see her this way.",QAnonCasualties
394,I tried to reason... Then I left,"I dated what I thought was a sane person for two years. He treated me well, but always kept something hidden. He is a divorced man in his early 40's, with two children (a girl and a boy). His ex-wife was less than stable, threatening me, harassing me, and generally making his life miserable. I thought his constant state of anxiety and agitation came from constantly watching his back with her because she would show up at his job, or drunk at his house at all hours (I witnessed this on several occasions). She eventually got convicted of Drunk and Disorderly Conduct, as well as Trespassing, for breaking into a man's house that she dated after he chose to end their extremely casual relationship. 

It wasn't until a few months in that I got a peek into his worldview. First, it started with the firm belief that the US never made it to the moon. Not exactly stuff to seriously worry about, because lots of people who don't hold horrible beliefs think that. It's not something worth arguing over. I dismissed it. It got worse from there. He kept telling me that I was blind to what really happens in government, in law, and in society. He was an ardent listener of Alex Jones and other conspiracy websites, purchased their products, and tried to purchase them for me. He railed against anyone or anything that challenged his ""correct"" worldview. He started following Q very closely. 

One day, he told me that people born on US soil are not automatic citizens. This was the first time I realized that he was serious about these theories and his beliefs. I opened a copy (one of many) of the Constitution that he kept handy and pointed out that the 14th Amendment defines citizenship as any person born in the United States. It's in plain text and was ratified in 1868, He told me I didn't understand the Constitution correctly. 

I graduated from law school, passed two different state bars on the first try, and practiced as a criminal lawyer. I know the 14th Amendment well. I am not, and was not, wrong. He used to praise me for my intelligence, except for when it came to matters of law. He didn't go to law school, he didn't practice law, and he isn't in any way an expert at anything. He chose instead to listen to Alex Jones, then Q, and other conspiracy proprietors. Soon, it moved on to questioning my every belief, bullying me when I disagreed, and telling me that I did not love my country or its citizens if I disagreed. He denied that the Proud Boys existed, and when challenged, just stated that they were true patriots fighting for the original Constitutional ideals. 

He berated me about Pizzagate (seriously messed up), the New World Order, and every other piece of crazy that came along. It got so bad that I actually asked him if he thought the world was flat. I got him into counseling, thinking that something had to shake loose. It didn't.  At this point, I already knew I wanted to end things, but he'd had major surgery and I was waiting a month for him to heal enough. He ended things before that. I gladly walked out and counted my blessings that I wasn't married to him. 

Two weeks later, he contacted me. He wanted all the parts of a relationship but to ignore our political differences. I calmly explained that his definition of a relationship is not what I want, need, or deserve. I tried being his friend. He got upset that I refused physical contact. I informed him that I am not willing to be his booty call. 

Then January 6th happened. He called me on January 7th to let me know that it was BLM and Antifa that stormed the Capital. I pushed back and told him Alex Jones was there, and of the hundreds of hours of footage of that horrible day, nobody once claimed to be a ""crisis actor' or part of anything but a supporter of the 45th President. He said again that I was blind, stupid, and I didn't know anything.

That was the last day I talked to him. I chose instead to walk away from the insanity, to save myself, and to stop trying to change someone who didn't want to change. I feel so badly for his two kids, who don't have a single stable parent. I'll regret forever that I could not help them, but saving myself became much more important. I couldn't write off the beliefs anymore as ""quirks"" or misunderstandings. 

I'm not here for praise, pity, or for any other reason than to tell you that the article in the Daily Dot made me feel seen and heard in a way I'd never felt about this subject. For all of you out there who are on the fence about leaving, have a go plan, tell your trusted group, and get out. They aren't going to change. They aren't coming back. They actively chose every single day to ignore all the counter-evidence and cling to a belief system not reflected in reality. 

It's like the airline instructions go, put the oxygen mask on yourself first, then on those around you. Protect your children, they are important, but in order to do that, you must protect yourself first. You do not deserve to spend your life justifying your belief that they are wrong. They certainly don't spend an ounce of time worrying about whether or not they are. Having to answer continuously for the new and bizarre theories they sprout is emotional abuse. Constantly worrying about what they will focus on next is abuse. You do not need to apologize, you do not need to isolate yourself or make excuses in order to not make waves. You have every right to protect yourself and those around you. Do not wait until beliefs become actions, because that day may come far faster than you think. Take a look at all the families and friends devastated by the actions of people who participated in storming the Capital. 

I do not state any of this lightly. I went through a horrible divorce 16 years ago and know what it is to lose everything. There are people who will help you, reassure you, remind you that you are not alone. I am here and I am one of them. 

For those of you blessed enough to have people become disillusioned with this movement, provide support. Help them get counseling. Listen actively when they tell you why they started down this rabbit hole. We are not alone and we will not be silent. Remember that no relationship is worth more than your safety and sanity. Again, you are not alone, and you never were.",QAnonCasualties
395,Almost lost it all,"I am happy to have found this group. Canadian, my partner fell into the abyss of the oil field mentality. The rabbit hole was deep and while commuted to ugliness we had never seen in him before, his children, who love him so deeply, said they were heartbroken and he heard. Literally deprogrammed him over weeks by showing him actual facts, other opinions etc and he is back. Horrified, he has literally cried at the hell we went through. He also recognizes that every conspiracy believing, anti mask, Trump supporter is a Conservative. This is scary in Canada, that the crazy of the US has landed on our soil. He said the oil field is a cesspool of uneducated a holes and he is embarrassed he fell for the length of time that he did.",QAnonCasualties
396,This is so unfair.,"Hello, this is a throwaway because I need to vent and I don't want this tied to my account or seen by anyone I may know.

My family had always been fundamentalist Christians and ultra-conservative. My mom was a vaccine skeptic nurse and my dad was always going on about how the royal family, Dr. Phil, and Maury were lizard people, how Israel and the United States made a deal with aliens, how devil worshippers ruled the world, and the fluoride in water made people obedient. My dad leaned much more into the...how do I say, ""Of this world"" parts of conspiracy theories, while my mom was the more staunch and smug fundamentalist Christian who went to every church service at our small somewhat cult-like church full of speaking in tongues, demon and holy spirit possession, and that ""divine seed"" tithing thing where the pastor tells everyone the exact amount to donate. And I remember them always being anti-government, especially while Obama was in office, despite all of the social programs they were benefitting off of.

My family had also always been abusive. They had always hit me and beat me as a kid and used their religion, mixed with heavy alcoholism, to make themselves feel better than other people while also justifying all of their shitty actions.

The 2016 election cycle made it so much worse.

I remember hearing about Pizzagate from my dad non-stop, Hillary's emails. All of that jazz. They were convinced the election would be rigged and that Hillary would win no matter what. And then came the great upset victory for Donald Trump. I still remember hearing my parents screaming every time a state was called for orange and waking up to their gleeful cheers that it was announced that Donald had won. 

And then down the Q hole, they went.

Every time I think about it I wish Hillary had won, and maybe they wouldn't have been so emboldened by Trump to spout their beliefs in public and double, triple, and quadruple down on their beliefs. Maybe I'd still have parents.

They went from what was ""normal"" mom and dad, to Qmom and Qdad. .

 They caught me with my first boyfriend(I am gay) when I was 15, and it got worse.

 And then I told them I was enlisting into the US military around my senior year of high school. Originally, they were proud, because Trump was the president and as commander in chief, he would be my ""boss"". It seemed like a win-win situation, I get to get away from their craziness and homophobia forever, and they get to be proud of their son. It was the first time in a long, long time I felt I had their true approval. 

I had moved out in May of last year before I finished high school. At the time, it was a big deal. . We had gotten into a few arguments during the summer and the fall, but overall, our relationship, as damaged as it was from everything, still seemed fixable. I could go to my mom for advice on my current boyfriend and in life and she would respond and help me. 

Then trump lost his re-election bid. I didn't even bother speaking to my parents in between the election loss and the inauguration. I knew the only thing they'd want to talk about. 

Biden was inaugurated. I had already signed my contract with the Air Force back in November. They immediately turned on me. My Qmom and Qdad started to openly call me a traitor, tell me I was gonna be working for the ""deep state"" and totally cut me off when I told them ""In the military, you don't get to pick and choose which administration you serve under. You swear an oath to the constitution and the government representing it, no matter who is in power at the time and no matter if you agree with their policy or not"".  Our relationship was already on shaky ground. Now it was shattered. 

I just can't help but fear that they truly will never speak to me again. It's been about a month since they went totally silent on me. I'm only 18, I still have a long portion of my life to live, and the idea of living it without parents is just so upsetting. I can't believe they cut me off like that. It's just so unfair that some random asshole on 4chan gave my parents a justification for all of the things they've done to me and made them okay with cutting off their only son. Of all things, I was expecting it to be my gay relationship that made them cut me off. They had made comments about me coming out for a while. Maybe they had been planning this. My relationship with my parents was screwed, but it felt so fixable. It felt like one day, maybe even years down the line, we could come together and love one another again. Now my hopes for a fixed relationship are all but crushed. However, boy am I glad that I had moved out pre-election time. It just seems so unfair that they would do this to me. Thank you for even reading this far and I hope all of you have a great night &lt;3",QAnonCasualties

400,Can you try to make a deal in advance about if March 4th is a bust?,"I can't imagine what some of you are going through. I feel like I dodged a bullet. I felt one of my family members going down this road every time I spoke to them about politics. It would get heated and they dug in.

I just stopped engaging them about it completely and it seems to have faded away before getting too deep.

I know you can't ""logic"" them out of it but wondered if anyone was trying to pre-emptively ""make a deal"" with your Q person.

Let them tell you what they think is going to happen March 4th and then simply ask them, if that doesn't happen will you stop believing? Try to make a deal. Get it in writing or on video. Let the results ""convince them"" rather than you convincing them. 

Seems like that might be more effective than trying to convince them after the fact. Get them to start making plans and decide what to do in advance. BEFORE they can begin rationalizing.

I believe that if I was confronted by a friend or family member with any of this lunacy, I would thank them for letting me know their true feelings and then calmly tell them that I didn't want to have anything to do with them any more unless and until they were able to come to their senses and apologize to me.

She says things to me I could never begin to imagine a child of mine would ever say.  I'm considering therapy to try and process everything she's thrown my way.  She faults me for not having/carrying a gun, tells me I'm on a list as a lib and will be attacked once the war starts.  I try to carry on but see an awful lot of darkness in the world right now. I currently have no physical access to my grandchild, I worry so much but I have no legal standing.  It's not against the law to be a ""believer"".  We do text some but without mom knowing or the ranting begins so we have to be careful.

408,Does rudeness lead to Qanon or vice versa?,"I have posted before about the person I lost, but I got to write about this situation at the craft store today.

I was at the craft store looking for a project. This is the kind of store that enforces mask rules hard core. No exceptions. This lady brought her kid in, no mask. Poor young worker had to go ask her to out on her mask, or offered to give her one. The lady said she didn't have one and would take it. So this girl gave her one. The lady took it, but didn't want to wear it. Young worker asked her to again, but when the lady kept refusing, she ran off. Now everyone is wearing a mask, even the lady's kid. So we are all giving her that look, but she ignored it all, just wandering around the store.

Now the manager comes over. He tells her she has to wear it, etc. Now she starts yelling. ""There's no law saying I have to wear it"" ""violating my civil rights"" etc. He tries to explain he is trying  to follow the state mandate, protect his employees. He is really trying to be reasonable and polite, but if she won't, she will have to leave. Then she goes full Q rude on him. According to her, when Trump is president again, he is going to shut down stores that force people to wear masks, and she will make sure he loses his job over this. It is sheep like him that make people afraid of covid, he just wants to control her but she won't let him. Her kid is almost crying. 

She finally leaves when he is going to call the police. How hard is it to put on the dumb mask? I mean, the store has got signs everywhere, it is not like she didn't know. Her kid is even wearing one. That poor kid looked like a miserable beat down puppy, wishing to be anywhere else. It seems like she went in looking for a fight the more I think about it. And to me that is so rude. I mean, the worker and manager don't have a choice. And it is a craft store, full of little old ladies. 

So does Qanon bring out that rudeness and disrespect for others and there opinions that was already inside or does it make people rude in a way they were not before?",QAnonCasualties
409,"Great, now my father is forwarding videos","He's an anti-Obama Trump supporter, which is disappointing enough, but doesn't get angry at me or argue when I debunk everything he sends. He just brushes it off with/as a joke, ""all politicians are the same,"" etc.

Today, though, one of his many boomer ""FWD:s"" included a video that's 2 hours long, with his friend's commentary saying ""as you all know, the election was rigged and stolen"" or whatever.

I responded with, ""Trump's case was thrown out of 60 courts because he's got NO EVIDENCE. If you seriously believe this crap, we need to have your mental state evaluated. This is PROPAGANDA.""

Don't know if he'll respond, or how deep he's in. Or even what exactly the video includes. It's so depressing how he doesn't listen to anything I tell him.

He proceeded to insult me by saying I grew up under a rock and that I had been blind to what had been going on in the country for the past 30 years.

She's a prime example of what it's like to be forgotten and poor in America. I used to regularly buy them food. She has no healthcare. Im constantly worried for her and my dad

But for some dumb reason she latched onto Trump and jumped into Qanon. She preaches about Charlie Kirk and how knowledgeable he is. She worships Ben Shapiro and the vomit he spews. She worships Trump and keeps swearing he is coming back into office. She believes Biden is drowning America. That he's taking welfare away. That America can't afford to give free healthcare because trickle down economics works

And the worst part? I can't even talk to her because she constantly argues with me. Its so bad that i can call to ask how her day is and she will bring up some garbage on Biden raping babies or something. I can't even talk to my mom anymore. I hate this shit. I hate Trump for spewing the vomit he did. I hate any conservative that spews more garbage that just tears families apart.

416,I had high hopes after the inauguration that this would go away,"First of all, I’m new here, this is my first time posting. I have a loved one who has been deep into QAnon for 2 years now. Like most of you, my loved ones and I have dealt with countless rants about Trump, the Illuminati, Satanists, Democrats being communists, etc. After the inauguration, I was listening to a podcast where the host was discussing Qanon and predicted that a large chunk of Q believers would become apolitical, out of disillusionment and shock that the thing they were molding their lives around turned out to be a giant lie. I didn’t think my loved one would become apolitical (she’s always been interested in politics), but I thought she would at least move on from Q and some of the wacko conspiracy theories.

Ever since, she’s been adamant that March 4th is the day Trump will retake power, and that the barbed wire around the Capitol building is just to prevent Biden from escaping his fate. At this point, I’ve begun to lose hope that she will give up on Q. Once March 4th comes and goes, she’ll probably have a new belief or reason to justify why the mass arrests didn’t happen. I think the rest of my loved ones have the same view as me at this point, that she’ll only let go of Q when she is ready and able to, and that trying to argue or dig her out will just lead to endless quarrels and drama that none of us are willing to put up with.",QAnonCasualties

I'm married for 5 years now. Have a wonderful 2 year old who has just started talking, and my wife is waiting for the awakening.

I think a big thread now is the military has secretly taken over and replaced all the evil people with clones and are secretly executing them. Ive stopped asking too many details because she gets angry and starts calling me the RET word, and/or dumb for not wanting to believe all this.

Besides that, she has started treating me like the house slave because I'm no more intelligent than the ""sheeple"".

I have no outs because I'm on a different passport, and if the marriage breaks there's a good chance I have to leave my kid with my wife, with no sane supervision.

So I'm treated horribly daily, and I am a good husband and good father.

What crime did I commit against the universe? I would have killed myself, because believe me the abuse is that bad and I'm horribly disappointed in what has happened to my soul mate. I can't do the deed, because I cannot leave an innocent child alone with this. Its like some form of horrible trap.... :)

420,Long term grief and the posthumous casualty?,"This might be too specific to me, but I thought I’d ask. My father died in 2012. He was a boomer who had been a hippie convert to evangelical Christianity, become a minister, a die-hard Obama hater (his #1 argument against Obama was that he was only “half black”), and Fox News addict. He also worked for an overtly political ministry and, unbeknownst to most everyone but a few of us, was a closet UFO and conspiracy fan. He was also a dedicated and gentle grandfather to my kids, and the best friend I ever had. 

Still, the last few years of his life, his rages at the left, gays, and immigrants had become more regular and more just... mean. He was only mean to people he didn’t know for the most part. I know that might be hard to understand. His diatribes about those people were reserved for his family mostly. But he and I did cross words a bit and he did once say we were “diametrically opposed” because I voted for Obama. That was so painful at the time. 

So, all prologue to how I’m feeling about this Q stuff. I just know, without any doubt at all, that my dad would have been 100% into it. And it’s made me feel shame and guilt that I am glad, in a way, that he’s not here to be a part of this insidious problem. And I hate feeling that way.

421,"""Mark (Zuckerberg) personally didn’t like the punishment, so he changed the rules""","I hope this is the right place to post this, as I feel it's very relevant to the discussions here about just how loved ones are being radicalized.

Just read a very interesting (and damning) Buzzfeed article about how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Joel Kaplan, VP of global public policy, interfered with departmental decisions and worked against efforts to reduce radicalization on the platform, even while publicly claiming to be combating it.

[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/mark-zuckerberg-joel-kaplan-facebook-alex-jones](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/mark-zuckerberg-joel-kaplan-facebook-alex-jones)

A few things really stick out in this piece:

&gt;earlier that spring, Facebook users began complaining that they were  seeing posts from conservative personalities including Ben Shapiro in  their News Feeds even though they had never engaged with that type of  content.

And:

&gt;the company continued to give known spreaders of false and misleading  information a pass if they were deemed “‘sensitive’ or likely to  retaliate,” the data scientist said.

There's a good stuff here, for one is that you need to approach changing someone's mind with humility and the things that Make them dig in their heels.

It's not just a logical belief it's a community QAnon folks are discovering

&gt; True persuasion is much more challenging than winning a debate. Sweeping away a falsehood is of little use unless you can replace the lie with a meaningful and empowering truth.

426,I don't know how to help my mom,"Since 2016, my mom's gotten deeper and deeper into right-wing brainwashing. Trump is like a god to her. She has tons of books about him, a giant Trump 2020 flag on her bedroom wall, and a Trump bobblehead to top it all off. When I was 14 and didn’t understand the weight of Trump’s candidacy, this was hilarious to me. Trump was a joke in my mind, and I didn’t see how deep my mom’s devotion to him went. We’d all make jokes about whatever dumb shit he’d do that week, and my mom would laugh but always make sure to defend him as well. She was so invested in Trump’s initial campaign and I only saw it as a bonding point for us. Even if I didn’t understand or care about Trump, he was something my mom and I could joke about. For Christmas I got her a copy of Art of the Deal, and for her birthday I got her the bobblehead.

Honestly, if I had a time machine, I’d go back and deck my 14 year old self for fueling her obsession like that. I wish I could’ve stopped it then, somehow. I regret it so fucking much, because since 2020, her absolute ***LOVE*** for him has been a nightmare for our family.

I’ve gotten way more liberal since I was 14. I donated as much as I could to Bernie, registered as a Democrat when I turned 18, and voted for Biden without a second thought. So obviously my political views are in STARK contrast to my mom’s, and even my dad’s, though he’s less intense about his. I’d probably say that my hatred for Trump and Republicans in general is just as strong as my mom’s undying trust and adoration for them, because since 2016, I’ve watched them completely destroy the mom I grew up with. I can’t even put into words how much I miss her and the relationship we used to have. 2020 was hell for us. We’d get in fights all the time, because she wears her views on her sleeve and I couldn’t keep my mouth shut when she’d go on rants about communism, BLM, antifa, and Democrats. I always felt like she was personally attacking my beliefs, and I was hurt.

Our fighting got so bad that my family staged an intervention for her in the middle of the year. It was fucking horrible. I never want to live through another night like that. My dad and I tried talking to my mom calmly about her addiction to right-wing social media and videos, but she got insanely hostile and defensive and started freaking out, which led to a bunch of crying and yelling from almost everyone. My sister, who was just 14 at the time, was bawling during it and was terrified our family was gonna break down. I felt awful, and I honestly felt like it was my fault. Like I should’ve just kept my mouth shut during all my mom’s rants, and we would’ve been fine. The next day, I actually went to my dad and told him I felt like I was toxic to the family. He reassured me that I wasn’t, but I dunno if I believe(d) it or not.

A few days later, my mom sent us a text explaining herself and said she was angry during the intervention “because her daughter had to watch the two men in her lives treat her like that”.

My dad got the text before I did, and told me not to read it. Obviously after such a fucking weird and ominous warning, I had to. And I was fucking LIVID. I went for a walk and when I came back, my mom wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything. She promised she’d take a break from social media and come back to the family again, and we made up. But that only lasted a few weeks until she slowly but surely fell back into the same addictions and routines.

Regardless, she and I still managed to go a few months without fighting, though it got harder when her intense opposition to masks started to become more prominent. My mom wears a mask, but it’s not really a mask. She bought a fake-out mask off of etsy. It looks like a proper one, but really it’s full of breathing holes. So that’s pretty fucking shitty of her. She doesn’t even wear a mask around my grandma. HER OWN MOTHER, because it’s “outside so it’s okay”.

UMMMM? MY GRANDMA IS 81 YEARS OLD. IF YOU DONT WANNA WEAR A REAL MASK AT A STORE BECAUSE “COVID’S JUST A FLU AND ONLY AFFECTS OLDER PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS”, FINE. IT’S FUCKING STUPID AND GROSSLY MISINFORMED OF YOU, BUT FINE.

BUT FUCKING ***81 YEARS OLD. SHE IS IN THE RANGE THAT YOU YOURSELF HAVE ADMITTED IS DANGEROUS. BUT YOU’RE SO FUCKING COMMITTED TO YOUR REBELLIOUS ANTI-GOVERNMENT LARP THAT YOU WON’T FUCKING WEAR A FUCKING MASK AROUND YOUR ELDERLY FUCKING MOTHER. THE PERSON WHO FUCKING RAISED YOU. I THINK MAYBE YOU OWE HER A PIECE OF CLOTH OVER YOUR FUCKING MOUTH AND NOSTRILS????***

anyway

I’d always gently try to nudge my mom in the right direction, but it never worked. She’d always get passive aggressive about it. Then December came, and we were going to pick out a tree. The night before, I’d read about how covid cases in our areas were on the rise. I was scared, so I decided to directly ask my mom if she’d be okay with wearing a real mask when we went. She got visibly frustrated and basically answered with “I don’t own one, so if you’re so uncomfortable with me not wearing one, just don’t come with us.”

Never mind the fact that you could borrow one of my five, but okay.

I should’ve responded calmly to that, but for some reason, that was the tipping point for me. It was like a whole year’s worth of rage came pouring out of me and I couldn't control myself. I started shaking and went on a really fucking loud rant about how she’d been brainwashed, was wrong about everything, and was consistently putting our family in danger. I’ve never argued so intensely with someone in my life. It was fucking awful. I hated it. I hope I never feel the need to talk to my mom like that ever again. But the absolute worst part came after, when my dad came to talk to me about it. He was so fucking pissed. He told me I was “forcing my beliefs on other people” and dividing the family. I told him they were endangering and failing us. I think about that conversation a lot, but I’ve never talked to my dad about it. My therapist thinks I should, but I just want to forget it happened.

My dad’s on the same side as me now, though. Though he still sees covid as a non-issue, he sees how brainwashed my mom is. She’s constantly talking to him about how Trump is still President and is just waiting for the right time to reveal it. She’s funneling conspiracy theories down his throat, and I can see how exhausted and worried he is. We’ve talked a lot lately about if there’s anything we can possibly do to help her, but we’re both at a complete loss. She won’t see the therapist she used to go to, because she knows the therapist is a liberal so she doesn’t trust her. She also strongly insists she doesn’t need therapy, and we can’t exactly force her there.

Today my parents and sister came home from a two-day vacation, and within an hour, I could hear my mom screaming at my dad about how he’s “trying to keep her from having her own opinions and beliefs”. She’s been in her room since, and when I asked my dad what sparked the argument, his response really fucked with me.

Apparently she’d started ranting about politics on the car ride home, and my dad reached his threshold today and confronted her about how insane her conspiracy theories are. When we talked, he told me that he has no idea what to do, that she’s “a different person”, and when I said I was really worried that this would end in divorce, he didn’t say otherwise. He just seemed so fucking sad, and kept apologizing for us being in this situation.

I feel like I should tell my mom how much her obsessions are affecting the family (she insists she keeps her politics to herself, but that’s clearly not the case. For fuck sake, she came home wearing a 2nd amendment sweatshirt), but I’m honestly terrified of confronting her about anything political again. I’ve fought with her so much and so often, I don’t want to anymore. It hurts me so much to be in that position with her, but maybe I need to be there again. I don’t know. I just want my mom back, so fucking badly.

Anyways, sorry this was super long, I just needed to rant to people ‘cause I don’t have therapy until tomorrow and I’m not close enough with any of my extended family to talk to them about this.

So yeah. Thanks, if you read this far. Also sorry for any typos or incoherent sentences. I don’t wanna proofread this kind of thing lol",QAnonCasualties
427,Losing Siblings to Q,"I just joined Reddit after reading an article “This Crap Means More to Him Than My Life: When QAnon Invades American Homes” because I am losing 4 of my sibling to QAnon Conspiracies. I have been close with my siblings all of my life. We always talked about Politics, even if we did agreed. That was up until 2 and a half years ago. 

I made a joke to one of my sisters, after Trump made a speech on The 4th of July. In this speech he made a mistake and said something along the lines of, in the Revolutionary War we took the Airports first. I thought this was hilarious. So, when I saw my sister that night she said she had taken her kids to the Revolutionary War Museum. I said did you see the airplanes and I laughed. She got very upset, barely talked to me the whole weekend and apparently complained to the whole family that I make everything political. When I was confronted by one of my other sisters, I was told I should apologize. My comment back was I did not make it political, it was funny and I had nothing to apologize for. I did however try to be careful of any other comments so as not to create waves. Then came 2020. I tried to ignore the posts on FB and did not text my family much before the election, because I did not want to alienate them. After the election I started to get messages and texts from aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings about how the election was stolen and about the mass voting fraud. I tried not to be condescending with replies, but a person can only take so much. One of my brothers, who I have always thought was intelligent, texted me during work with this super long text explaining, with articles and videos, how there were these massive data dumps during the counts on election night. I did respond to say that these so called data dumps were in fact mail in ballots being counted, because of when each state was allowed to process these. I also said do you really think that the democratics could pull this off and even recruit republicans without anyone speaking up? He came back with those republicans are “never Trumpers”.  I asked that he stop texting me these things and while he said he would, he didn’t stop. 

I need to explain that I come from a military family. So, after the attack on the capital, when I had heard a rumor that this brother was at the Trump Rally on the sixth, on the 7th I worked up enough courage to I ask a question I wish I had never asked, I texted him “Were you at the Capital yesterday?”  His reply was “Yes, I was expressing my 1st amendment right and I am proud to have been there. It was sad how it ended.” It was the first time in my life I have been ashamed of an action one of my siblings took. I received a text soon after from a sister, saying she couldn’t believe that I was upset about what happened on the 6th, but I was ok with riots over the summer. Again I tried to explain they weren’t the same and that while I agreed with protester this summer, I did not agree with the rioting. A lot was said on that text thread that I wish I could forget. She talked about how the US was on the brink of a color war, how she was tired of being called a racist for the past 4 years and that I should not trust the MS media. A couple of days later she decided she could not talk about politics with me any longer. This was probably a good decision. 

Now my mom has been back and forth on what she thinks of all of this and up until a couple of weeks ago she was going to get the COVID-19 vaccine. I had not really said much to her on this, but I was secretly glad that in this one instance she was going to do what was best for her. Then suddenly she changed her mind, my mom knew I was upset that she had decided not to get the vaccine. She told me that she had talked to my sister and with all the issues with the vaccine she did not feel comfortable getting it. I know what your thinking, my mom is an adult and can make up her own mind. I don’t completely disagree with that, except that this sister is in the medical field and my mom is 87, has congenital heart disease and is a breast cancer survivor. Hours after this conversation with my mom, I received a text on the siblings feed from said sister, informing us of the conversation she had with my mom earlier in the week. My self and one brother expressed that we felt it was irresponsible to advise mom this way. Then the four siblings start in on how the vaccine changes your DNA, the shape of your cells, that the animal testing was skipped, how the vaccine can cause fertility issues and it can be found in the placenta. After my brother and I asked the 4 to stop 3 times, they kept texting. It is almost like they not only have to get the last word in, but by doing so they are right. My brother then said he would be blocking us all so he would not have to listen to all of the QAnon debates. No one protested over this declaration. I sent a separate text to my brother telling him not block me. He said would not, but that he can’t listen to anymore Trump/QAnon “Bullshit”. Even after that my sibling didn’t stop. One even saying C’est la vie!! I truly couldn’t believe that my siblings were ok with throwing one of us away!! Is all of this crap really so important to you??  How do they not see the truth? This was the last straw for my one brother and me. I stopped responding to the 4 siblings, but can’t stand the thought of blocking them. A week later 2 sisters texted me like nothing had happen the week before and the sister, that sent the text informing us the week before, sent a text apologizing. Saying she didn’t mean for the conversation to turn into what it did. She missed me and wanted to talk. I told her that I do not want to talk right now and that I don’t know how we come back from this. She then said something I find ironic “Our love is stronger than any government or disease”. Really? Did she not see the same conversation I saw? I have cried myself to sleep for the past 2 and a half weeks, not to mention the times before this, feeling them slip away.  

I am sorry for going on and on, it is just that I feel so alone with this and reading all of these similar story has made me like I can talk about it and people won’t think I’m crazy.",QAnonCasualties

I no longer have a relationship with my family. I avoid their phone calls. Our neighbors that we were once good friends with are full Q. A guy that was basically my brother is now full Q. Before this, not exaggerating, I would have trusted him to help me hide a body. Now I don't know him. Only person I've ever called bro and meant it.

I feel like the crazy one a lot of the time. It's like invasion of the pod people. Had a guy at a hardware store get so mad and red in the face because I was wearing a mask that I thought I was going to have to pull my gun.

People try and slide chump and Q stuff into business phone calls. Little feelers to see if you're a believer. Happens to me about once a week.

It doesn't feel real. I think I'm going to have something like PTSD from this.

Sometimes I ask my wife to tell me I'm not crazy.

My wife and I have to decided to get the kids, animals, and ourselves out of the South. We're going to head north. We've got four years before the next presidential election. We don't want to be here for another election.

I need to come up with a new career. I don't think I want to be a manager anymore. This has been sickening. Having to smile and be nice to these people.

We want some land up near the Canadian border. Have to learn to live with snow and cold. We want to live in a rural blue county. It's going to take money that we don't have.

There was always racism and ignorance in the South, but this is different. It's so ugly now. I worry about our safety, this how the Nazis ended up building concentration camps. These people are nucking futz and a lot of them aren't coming back.

433,When should I reach out? Lost two military friends to Qanon...,"I have lost two friends, both in the US Armed Forces, to Qanon.  Well, one for sure, and one I suspect based on some political discussions we had before the election.

One of them unfriended me, the other unfriended and blocked me (but I still have another way of contacting him).  In general, what percentage of former Qanon followers now realize it was all a bunch of BS now?  I'm just wondering when the right time to reach out is, and what to say, since it would be a little awkward to simply ignore that they unfriended/blocked me.  These are people I love and care about.

As an aside, I am pretty vocal about my political beliefs (centrist/moderate Democrat, absolutely detest Trump) and I know they've seen my posts and they are both Republicans who became QAnon Republicans for whatever reason.  I'm wondering given all of this, if I should wait longer or reach out now?

434,You know they’re lost when “disinformation is necessary”. How do you even argue that?,"I’ve come to terms that my marriage is over.  My stbx doesn’t want a divorce, but I cannot live like this anymore.  We got into it and he said he doesn’t care what people think of Q.  That Q teaches people to think for themselves.  

I (stupidly) bring up the fact that so many predictions have come and gone but things are still the same.  Wasn’t Trump President the last 4 years, what has he done to stop the Deep State?  He tells me “these things take time”.... of course they do *eyeroll*.  I go back to the dates never coming to fruition and now Q doesn’t post using specific dates as he did before, that Q used to write differently on 4chan vs 8kun and his first post about Hillary never happened. 

I’m sure he was shocked at everything I knew, but all I get is “Disinformation is necessary”.  So I question, how do QAnons decipher what’s false and what’s true??  What makes everything you (or others) think to be true and not disinformation? 

He says the posts are in codes and necessary to throw people off, to see if they are true Anons/Patriots. So, you’re telling me the same Deep State running the world for the last how-many-ever-years are easily thrown off while your average QAnon is able to decipher the codes and he posted on 4chan because it’s a free platform?  My Qultist is one of the most computer illiterate people I know, barely able to work a printer; and I’m supposed to believe he can outsmart the Deep State?  Not buying it.

I don’t know much about the tripcodes but highly doubt a top military official would choose to use that platform. He brings up people like Julian Assange, operation mockingbird or that Epstein was arrested, and that’s suppose to be the truth that Q exists? 

When he would say there’s a reason behind Trump posting ‘covfefe’, I knew I was losing him.  What do you even say to “disinformation is necessary”?  Just another thing to make me realize he’s so far in, nothing will bring him back.",QAnonCasualties

She said she's 'excited' for the days to come, because the Vatican has been raided and all the gold has been captured and America will no longer be on a system of currency, but live on a system of gold. That all of our debts will be forgiven in this new system and Satan will be overthrown.

I didn't even know this movement existed until yesterday because I stay out of mainstream media. I am so shocked.

She has always been a loving woman and someone I genuinely admired growing up, she was always a beacon of optimism.

After her cancer diagnosis in 2018 (she's cured now btw), she stopped working and went on an early retirement. This gave her a lot of time to pursue her passions and for a time we were all very happy for her, she seemed  to be getting out of that terrible time rather well. 

Now with the pandemic however, she's starting to talk about conspiracy theories more and more. She's at home more and just browses the internet for the entire day.

Everytime we talk it eventually gets to her lecturing me about how the government of my country is comprised of ""a bunch of leftist globalists"", how the vaccine changes your DNA and how men apparently aren't allowed to be men anymore. 

I tried to reason with her and calmly explain that the government is in fact not socialist, that more attention to the problems and needs of minorities isn't a threat to white people but she just doesn't seem to want to get it. 

2 weeks ago she told me she intends to vote for a party in our country called FvD, a far-right, mysoginistic cult similar to Trumpism. She started to dismiss any criticism of the party as some lie fabricated by the media.

437,European Mother into Q and guilt tripping,"Sorry if it’s long, trying to squeeze it all in! 

I’m 28(f) and throughout my 20s I struggled with the relationship I have with my mum. For context, we moved to London from Poland when I was 12 with younger brother (now 24) my mum and dad. They divorced shortly after and my dad isn’t in the picture for years. With her being alone in the new country, I was the first one who learned English, we had money issues so for years I would be dragged into translating council issues, calling providers, taking care of stuff, took me to court as a translator too, in hindsight I really shouldn’t have done any of it, it messed me up and I still go therapy to sort it. 

Nowadays, she tells me I never done anything growing up, and sweeps that whole chapter under the rug. 

Before the pandemic, we would still fight, mostly over me not being there enough for her and me gaining weight (fat shamed me for 5 years). She would always try to force some weird holistic approach, finding “magic cures” on Facebook. Magnetised water or some other bull. 

Well now that the pandemic is here, it feels so much worse. The London lockdowns are pretty strict, and I do try my best to follow the advise where possible. Definitely a household of science believers. My mum is not. She supports anti-vaxxes, believes in most conspiracies, such as the pandemic being planned, it not being as serious, even has weird Q believes where Trump is “the saviour”  and democrats are all pedophiles. (She’s Polish and lives in the UK, it still confuses me why she cares).

My brother also believes in conspiracies and they egg each other on. However, he moved to Poland in July 2020 so I’m the last family she has here. They both believe I’m the “sheep” and they are open minded. I want to be careful about seeing my mum because I have had friends who’s parents died from the virus, and even people my age struggles with the disease. 

So now we see each other less, and she blames me for it. She thinks I’m an idiot for wanting to stay safe, and also thinks I don’t wanna see her at all. Just got off the call with her where she said stuff like “I won’t bother inviting you to stay at mine” “you do not wanna see me at all, that’s fine”. I was literally calling her to see her for a walk, but she didn’t want to cos it’s cold. It all escalated and I ended up in tears. 

I don’t know what to do, like they are both super deep into these conspiracies, and there is nothing I can do to get them out of it. I tired since March 2020. We fight about it all the time. I try to change the subject often. I just want it to be normal, and healthy, but instead all I feel is guilt. I don’t know how to stop feeling this way. I’m doing as well as I can at this point, I work from home, I exercise, take vitamins, try to be kind to myself to survive this lockdown.

Sometime around 330am he came and woke me up to tell me ""it"" was happening. He swears he saw Chris Cuomo change his demeanor and look at Don Lemon for who he really was, a pedophile. He firmly believes that CNN has been taken over by Trump, Biden is filming from Castlerock studios, and Don Lemon and Tom Hanks are part of a pedophile ring. The scariest part is he says he saw their eyes turn black on inauguration night, which he thinks was a special effect used to show people who they really are.

442,Getting Out Of The Rabbit Hole,"I haven't been here before and I am a bit speechless to realize that I was not alone. I've read through articles just recently and it has been so strange to realize that what I was thinking/seeing/going through was happening all over. I thought it was just me.

My husband started talking about this back in March of last year, circling through the summer and into the end of the year, when it got really bad. I'm happy to say that I think for the majority of it, I've gotten my husband back, but I'm still not 100% sure.

Back during the height of the mess, I was in the garage on a few nights with him and a friend when I first heard talk about the conspiracy nature of everything going on. The pedophile ring, the election conspiracy, the deep state, the QAnon predictions. My husband not trusting the pandemic, stopping use of Google and moving to Parlor, getting into conversations on other websites that were unmonitored and uncontrolled. He got more involved in ensuring his guns and ammo were stocked up, his safety was secure and connected himself to resources offering me the option to go through gun safety so that I understood and prepared myself for anything. I tried to wipe my fears away and hide how strange it was to me, but it just grew worse leading into winter of 2020. Eventually I stopped sitting/standing with them as they talked and even though my husband grew silent and heavily involved in this 'world', he still remained open to me and worked hard, nothing changing that I could see that took him away from me. As I realize others did, I took on the roles of taking care of day to day things like bills, groceries, cleaning, etc. I was (and still am) working from home so I ensured to focus entirely on that, the current and now, to keep myself sane and honestly not have the heated topics in conversation like the ""COVID conspiracy"" or how the mask mandates were just a way to hold us down. I just continued to focus on what I could control. Luckily as we creep further into 2021, I am starting to feel a bit lighter.

There was a short period of time in the height of the election &amp; the following month that threw me for a loop, but I held on. I braced myself for this great awakening to only find that as time went by, life continued on. I saw that my husband stepped back closer to me. Eventually we did have a few discussions and I am mostly sure that he's come back ""down"" to me. He did say that he felt sad that he was lied to and that even though he thinks now that there are still things ""yet to come"", he realizes that the things he was told were false and he no longer believed in the Q conspiracy.

So now that I see that I am by far not alone (thanks to a post I finally found,), I know that I could really use to help through this and maybe I can offer support to others out there. So I'm here, I appreciate what I see so far as a support for people like me and I hope that I can safely say that I have my husband back.",QAnonCasualties

445,Final step is divorce,"First off, let me say that I am happy to have found this group. For so long I have wondered how many spouses or family members have been victimized by QAnon and having it consume a loved one. I will keep my story short. I noticed that my wife started staying up at all hours of the night watching conspiracy theory videos. This behavior continued to progress and consume her every waking moment. Not knowing how to handle the situation, I secretly hoped that eventually, she would make her way back to common sense; however, it only became worse, eventually culminating with her claiming that TV game shows were obviously talking in code to the other Hollywood elite pedophile ring members.

Feeling like I had no choice, I tried talking with her and asked her to see a mental health professional for unbiased advice. She adamantly refused and said she doesn't need to see a doctor. Also, let me say that she does have a history of documented mental illness that was treated and is a very successful professional. I had discovered the VICE documentary QAnon: The search for Q and had hoped I could get her to sit down and watch it with me in hopes of reeling her back to some sense of normalcy. As I waited for the right time to ask her to watch this TV series with me, she had woken me up one morning very early to ask me to watch a video. The name escapes me right now; however, it was approximately 40 minutes long and ran the gambit of QAnon conspiracy theories about how Trump is the secret world leader, the cabal, Hollywood pedophile rings, and of course, Adrenochrome and the torture of babies. I suffered through the entire video and then asked her to please watch the VICE series with me or even one episode, and she refused. It is so madding that at every turn, she has refused to come back to reality and seek help. Not having any further choice, I told her that if she did not see a doctor that our marriage was over.

446,How to help my mom?,"So my mom got sucked into all the QAnon hype around election time. She has been watching videos, talking to these people and basically reading articles 24/7 now. It’s gotten to the point that it’s affected her job and is starting to fracture family relationships. 

I’ve tried to be patient and let her try to figure it out on her own, but I finally blew up on her yesterday and tried to point out the ridiculousness of all of this. She obviously responded poorly. 

She has self imposed deadlines for when she would give it up multiple times. She first said it was when the blackouts were supposed to occur in early January, next it was the inauguration, now it’s after March 4th...

I’ve tried telling her that it’s a cult and they will always have an excuse or reason for why their theories aren’t coming true. My greatest fear is that they will just keep throwing enough stuff against the wall that eventually one of their theories will come true and my mom will believe in them even more. 

So I guess my question is what’s the best way to handle this situation. My sister and I have tried talking to her, but she is so caught up she thinks we are the crazy ones and aren’t open minded.

448,The saddest post that I ever saw on the Q boards— the Great Awakening casualty.,"I’ve been lurking on PW/GA/others for a few months now.  At first it was just because I was awestruck at their theories and conspiracies. I have to admit I checked the boards any time I would pick up my phone.  Without believing a word of it I still feel like I felt, to some degree, what they feel, some level of addiction.

And, at the time, I found the most interesting threads were the ones where people expressed doubt towards their own beliefs—or “doomer threads”, as Q people are apt to call them.

Most doomer threads don’t last long.  They get downvoted to oblivion, or banned by the moderators who don’t want a public showing of doubt towards their beloved ideology. But there was one doomer thread that skyrocketed to the top of GA, and it happened shortly after the inauguration.

I think the thread was allowed for a couple of reasons: first, a lot of Q followers felt some level of disappointment after Biden was sworn in and it became a place to vent. And second, because of the title of the post. The title of the post, and this is all from memory so it may not be exact, was something like:

“Well, after 22 years, she’s divorcing me!”

The post was authored by a man who’d been married to his wife for 22 years, and she’d left him shortly after the inauguration because of his Q beliefs.  But what shocked me was that the spin he put on it was *almost* positive. He was trying to use it as a “badge of honor” of sorts— “my-swinging-dick-is-bigger-than-your-swinging-dick-because-I-believed-so-hard-that-my-wife-left-me.”

And *everyone* supported  it.  The thread was full of comments like “you dodged a bullet,” “you’re better off without her,” and “that’s what you get for marrying a lib.” There wasn’t a single comment that suggested maybe he should chill out on the Q stuff for a little while, or asked him if he was okay.  Not one. I looked.

Then, reading through his responses to the comments in the thread, I realized he *wasn’t* okay.  And after rereading the original post, I saw that it was filled with thinly veiled panic masked by weak machismo.  And his responses were even less convincing. Stuff like:

“Thanks for the support, but after 22 years I’m a little worried how I’m going to fend for myself.”

“I actually really love her, I thought she was my soul mate.”

“I know she was a leftist and I know how important the work we do here is, but something about this just feels wrong.”

And just like that, I went my fascination in Q followers turn to ash in my mouth. Like, fuck. This guy’s life has just been turned upside down, and the only group he can turn to for solace is so ass backwards that they can’t imagine *not* being happy about divorcing someone you’ve loved for over two decades, purely because she a liberal. 

You could see him squirming in his post history. Trying to hint that he needed emotional support from the people he considered his friends. But it just wasn’t going to work—that’s not who these people are.

It was fucking tragic and after that, I stopped browsing the boards so often, and I stopped being angry at these people.  I couldn’t get riled up reading their insane beliefs anymore because I could only feel pity.  I know a lot of people on this subreddit feel like their loved one is a different person, or has become crass to their affections, and worry that they may be gone for good. And I’m no expert, but to me, that guy who made that one post on GA will always be proof that somewhere, buried beneath mountains of insecurity, denial, and fear, is the person they were before the Q shit hit the fan.

I can only hope he got the help he needed.",QAnonCasualties

But every time when i was using a quote from trump he ""explained"" it away like this:
""when trump says vaccines he means the military"" or ""when Trump says virus he means the Deep State""
This made me wondering. When they always make something up when they disagree with trump how much powers does trump actually have over the Q-People",QAnonCasualties
451,So how many of your Q-people are talking with a robot in their head?,"Just curious, as this one has me thrown for a loop.

First, I was able to get my Q-mom to open up enough that I was shocked to discover she thought she had been ""having conversations with me telepathically for more than a year""!! (boggle!  😳😱)  No wonder she seemed to blow up over the tiniest things - as if she'd been arguing with me about it hours per day for a year! 

I started to work with her, following a therapist's advice, by normalizing her need to converse, sometimes out loud, with her imaginary friends. At first, I made up my own inner conversation partners and occasionally talked to ""them"" around her.

Until after a few attempts at this, she looked at me like I was the crazy one.  ""You're just making that up!  Or you need to clean out your ears... all that wax crackling about.  Here, I'll transcribe what I hear and you do the same and we'll compare.""

""Um.... okay.... mom... gotta go um.... pick up some things from the grocery.""  Me slowly backing away.

""It's 1am.  Grocery's closed.  Nice try.  Good one.""

And that began the all-night conversation which led to me transcribing, with her help, all the ""conversations"" she was having in her head.  I'm pretty sure I've got a good novel's worth.  

Some she thought were with God.  Some Jesus.  And maybe some Men in Black super secret alien agent movie plot mixed in there. 

But once I started writing it all down to help her understand how to deal with the hallucinations better, I noticed a couple of things.

One - as a machine learning and natural language processing type, I immediately recognized the tell-tale signs of...  GPT-2 - and similar ""generative text"" systems.

I could even feed her things to ""say back to the voices"" and effectively retrain the model a bit.  And predict the outcome - great magic trick for getting through to Q-mom.

Anyway, it's taken over a year... a very strange one at that, but, although she wears her earbuds everywhere now so she can look like she's having a phone conversation if she needs to drown out the ""voices"" while out in public... apart from that, I think I may have my mom back.

454,Mother &amp; Conspiracies,"TL;DR - mother believes in conspiracies around Covid &amp; beyond, consequences involving grandchild. 

I found this sub and thought I'd post my experience. The relationship with my mother and I (34M) has been a bit strained ever since I got married. We were always a bit snappy with each other and frequently had disagreements about how to do things - e.g. the way I was raising my child etc

Befofe Covid19, she was looking after my child for 2 days a week whilst my partner worked (I work full time).
When Covid19 hit, both my parents understandably went into isolation - they didn't see us or my daughter and ceased having her every week. We were all scared back then so this was fine

When things started opening back up in the UK, I noticed that my mum was posting increasingly erratic things on FB. It started with criticism of the government - which is totally acceptable, the UK gov were reckless with Covid19. Her posts then started to spill into posting ""doctors"" talking ""facts"" about Covid19 - things like death rates, cause of death &amp; why it isn't as serious

When the next lockdown hit (UK have had 3 so far) she was less tolerant/scared than before so went full throttle on ""doing her own research"" and posting it on FB. Laughably, the majority of things she shares on FB get labelled as missinformation, but this is of course a FB attempt to silence her. Things really ramped up with the news of the vaccine. She went into fake news hyper drive, the whole works of microchips and 5g. 

When Christmas rolled around, I decided to go round there and try to put all aside to have a nice time. She spent most of the day telling us various snippets of information such as how the Queen was really dead and the person on TV was a stand-in.
It all culminated on boxing Day with me being tired of the shot and asking her straight up if she believed that the government are trying to implant people with a 5g controllable microchip - she said she did and it was called nanotechnology
I called her crazy and said she needed help (a release of frustration on my part!) And her reaction was to refuse to have my daughter every week. 

Fast forward to today, she has not seen my daughter for 2 months now. We have not spoken to her for the same time. My parents have agreed to separate wherever possible, apparently they've felt like that for ages. Whenever my dad asks her to come and see my daughter with him in the park, she refuses. She doesn't ask after her at all. 
That has been the most shocking part of all this; this collection of conspiracy theories has in effect had a contribution to make her not want to see her granddaighter anymore. 

Some of the things she believes (so far) - maybe it will resonate with other people in the UK/world:

	- Covid19 is a hoax, perpetuated by the world elite (bezos,Zuckerberg,gates) to reset the population
	- The UK government are in on this and will be arrested any day via a common law uprising
	- The government are putting things in the water (she now drinks water out of a jug with anrod of charcoal in it)
	- That the common law of the land will soon overtake actual law via the magna carta declarations. She has printed several letters to barons in the UK pledging allegiance to them
	- That the vaccine is poison and has 5g chips in it. She has even gone as far as to verbally accost volunteers at vaccine centers whilst passing
	- She refuses to wear a mask anywhere she goes. In the UK, you're now challenged if you enter a shop without one unless you medically exempt; she has bought a special lanyard you can wear to pretend she has a disability and is exempt
	- She goes on anti protest rallies in London and Brighton. She has two new protesting friends she has never known before that she is close to

Bit long, but thanks for reading - cathartic to put it in words. Be interested to hear about any other UK people being affected by anything similar.",QAnonCasualties
455,What I feared most happened :(,"Within the past few months, my cousin has gone from an open minded BERNIE FAN who wanted to go to a BLM protest with me, to a conservative conspiracy theorist. I really thought she would somehow notice the change and maybe take a step back, but now I realize this was an extremely naive thought on my part. The last straw was when she told me it was proven that Hillary colluded with Russia, I called bullshit, and days later she sent me documents (reliable enough, but nothing proving collusion on Hillary’s part in my opinion). She went through each document and explained it to me, and the last part she wrote was about how these documents are “the tip of the iceberg” and “...when I truly put my head down and began researching this, I was shocked and honestly embarrassed that I was mislead and lied to by the media and others perpetuating it.” Is this not a classic example of how a conspiracy theorist speaks? I am heartbroken but at the same time, at peace, in an odd way. I knew this was coming so it’s not necessarily shocking. I was the last person in our family that was talking to her, and now the only person she talks to is her boyfriend, who I suspect has something to do with her opinions changing as he is a huge Trump supporter and sees nothing wrong with calling corona “China virus” among many other bigoted views. Any advice or even random words would be appreciated ❤️",QAnonCasualties

457,How I've prevented vulnerable friends and family from falling into the infodemic of misinformation.,"I've seen a lot of people struggling on this subreddit and many feel hopeless, but I've found a technique that gets results more consistently than any other I've found yet. It is r/StreetEpistemology or SE for short. SE has many advantages over a traditional debate. Rather than trying to convince the other person of anything it simply aims at getting them to think critically about the methods they are using to reach a conclusion. This will gently nudge them into considering how certain they are if a belief is true or not and to reanalyze their beliefs. It takes less energy and time than other methods, and is much more peaceful and friendly. It is also much easier to learn than most other techniques I've tried, and can be learned by simply watching/listening to others do it on YouTube and practicing for oneself, though it does help to read books and such on the subject as well. With time it becomes so natural one will catch themselves doing it without even trying.  


So for how this saved my friends and family: since the pandemic started I've been using my SE skills to deescalate confrontation, better understand the wants and needs of my family, and most importantly discuss the information my family and friends find about various current events. At first some of them were definitely beginning to fall hook line and sinker into the pit of conspiracy theories, and they still do struggle sometimes, but here is where my store differs from those here. After enough practice in SE I was able to get them to reconsider these beliefs more carefully, and now I don't even really need to use SE much at all. They will simply show me whatever new conspiracy theory they are falling for and I fact check it for them (and try to give a brief explanation of how I can tell fact from fiction to make them less dependent on me with time). They've gained enough trust in my abilities that we can skip right to the end of the debate and just finish off the misinformation. It is still very important that I remain open minded to their beliefs. I haven't convinced them I'm smarter than them, and I don't act better nor believe I am better or smarter than them (if I did they would stop trusting me). I've simply proven to them my ability to sort fact from fiction enough that they pretty much take my word for it. All information they send my way I treat as though it could be true, but give it the analysis. My communication skills aren't perfect but I do my best not to make them feel judged even if they bring up something wild, this makes them much more comfortable sharing and trusting me.  


I've heard of an ex Q follower being deconverted because of SE and I hope this tool can help many of you here as well. No method is 100%, but this method seems to have the best track record of any so far I can find.",QAnonCasualties
458,My Q-in-laws,"Hi, all. Unfortunately I'm stuck living with my right wing in-laws. It's wearing me out, but I'm coping. I was wondering if anyone else has seen their Q people reading and sharing things from Epoch Times? Last week I also saw the Newsmax magazine make its first appearance in the house. I'm bracing for an extra side of crazy. It's like trying to box against smoke. Thank you for being here!",QAnonCasualties
459,How to pull them back when the thread is lost?,"I know these posts are supposed to be specific to Q- losses, and mine might not be a great enough loss. I cut out a lot of friends/family after 2016 when the rhetoric heated up. I didn’t expect to be tossed from FB by an intelligent, lively, articulate cousin when she became an anti-vaxxer, anti-Fauci, Trump-loving human despite losing her steel career in 2019 because of tariffs. Chances are she’s Q. I feel like her descent is directly related to 1. Free time from no job since 2019 (when the Mill was shutdown) and 2. A constant barrage of misinformation on social media. 

I, nor anyone in my family, knows how far down she’s gone. By Christmas 2020 she blocked all of us who disagreed with her. Is it that quick for everyone? How does it happen so quick? And when it’s the mom, (step) dad, daughter and son-in-law, two sons and one daughter-in-law (it appears one DiL is in opposition), and three of four grandchildren supporting the conspiracy, how do you speak to any party as an individual?

One day I’ll have to face her and her family (family funerals) and I don’t know how to treat her and hers.",QAnonCasualties
460,Random shoutout to r/FoxBrain,"It’s a little smaller than this sub (and they have non-text posts sometimes, which should probably change - this formats way better), but it’s effectively the same thing, except not specific to QAnon (or even just Fox - general Rightwing media brainwashing).  Though the core is people connecting over family members that are struggling with indoctrination, it also seems to focus a little more on deprogramming.

Both subs are great and do their own thing, but for people here, I think it’s definitely worth checking out.",QAnonCasualties
461,Simon Parkes Org?,"Hello - I am very new to this world. Reddit included. Please be kind. I wanted to find a space to talk to people in the same situation as myself.

Recently - my mother has been incredibly vocal about not getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Almost every morning she sends me nonsense videos about it. Talking about patent code 666, there's an ingredient in it called 'Luciferous', it will change your DNA, etc. She goes on and on. The videos are of no merit &amp; have no sources. The first one she sent me was of a Dr. Christiane Northrup. I did some research on her and turns our she was once a normal respected doctor turned kook in recent years. 

Now two days ago my sister tells me that my mom is into some ""Simon Parkes Org"". I, of course, did some of my own research on this guy and his website. All of it is completely bonkers. But I'm not sure if it's considered ""QAnon""? Is anyone else familiar with this 'Simon Parkes'? 

Like I said - she has been completely anti-vac for at least the last month or so. Sending me messages with crazy videos almost daily that make zero sense &amp; have no real facts. She also has made mention to me about 5G &amp; blocking it. Again, not sure if this is QAnon or not?

Quote she sent me in a message: ""I know you are skeptical and siding with mainsteam media and censuring that is going on related to the covid vaccine."" Sounds like straight QAnon BS to me. 

My sister informed me she also said: Trump is president and Biden is projected in a studio out of CA, All democrats are going to be arrested, new capitol will be in Texas, Trump will be renounced as the 19th president at that time????? I know most of this is QAnon. And mind you this is like a game of telephone because my sister doesn't live there either, she is hearing this from our dad (who is Republican &amp; a Trumper but thinks this QAnon stuff is going too far). He said she spends almost all day glued to her phone.

My mom has never been one to really be into politics at all. My sister &amp; I were vaccinated as children. She has never brought up any of this stuff in my 31 years on this earth. I am terrified it is QAnon &amp; I don't know what I can do to stop it. I feel like she's just going to keep getting more &amp; more stuck down the rabbit hole. This is never something I imagined she would get into. I have a six month old - her first grandchild - and if she's going to continue down this path, I'd rather just cut ties now. I'm devastated.",QAnonCasualties
462,A Q person I know is spouting even more insane stuff than usual in the past few days,I know this person very well and usually is more of the mild Q stuff and not the whole satanic sacrifice adrenochrome stuff but yesterday he claimed that joe Biden hired China to use its weather tech to cause the Texas storm as an attack on the anti mask/corona deniers to force them to quarantine...... just wanna let y’all know what they’re talking about,QAnonCasualties
463,It's Over,"So, I've been on the group a long time.  I won't repeat all the details of my Q-story from the beginning as it would be very long; you can read through my post history if you want the whole thing.  Short version-gay, with my husband for 15 years, 4 of them legally married.  I discovered he was in Q late last summer, although I now think he was in as early as March 2020.  He's gone the whole gamut-not just Q and Trump and Adrenochrome, but aliens, Simon Parkes, Charlie Ward, santa surfing, and all those grifters.  I don't know who got who into it, but he and my brother in law are also Q buddies.

I started therapy about a month ago.  I've asked Qhub to do counseling with me several times and he refuses.  But, with the help of my therapist, I wrote him a very long, very loving letter about how this has hurt me, the negative affects its had on us, and how I wanted to save our relationship and get him out of this.  The therapist coached me and helped me revise it so it was very, very loving, as nonjudgmental, and nonconfrontational as possible, and using all us/we statements, not I/me.  Just the way all the cult experts recommend.  I gave it to him on the 6th.  After a near 2 hour conversation which was very difficult, but we got through it, we made a commitment that he would drop all alternative media for 3 weeks-taking us to March 4, which happens to be his birthday (I know).  He claimed he didn't know anything about March 4 being the new Q date because he ""doesn't follow Q""-he's very good at flipping the script and gaslighting and using technicalities and such to get out of what I know to be true and making ME feel like the crazy one.  But, I let all that go, because I got the commitment.  He even deleted Epoch Times, Newsmax, and OANN off his phone right in front of me.

Since then, life has been really good.  We went out for dim sum the next day and we've had several very nice date nights since, and it felt SO good.  That's what hurts so much.   I knew he wasn't deprogrammed by any stretch, but I thought the process had started.  I saw real potential of saving my marriage.

Today I discovered that he is still watching videos in violation of our agreement.  He maybe made it a week tops and then right back to Q.  It's more important to him than me, our marriage, our dogs, etc.  That's it.  I haven't told him yet, but I can't take anymore.  He needs professional help and I'm not qualified to give it.  I'm done.  I haven't confronted him yet; I'm just too tired for that tonight.  I'm going to sleep on it.

Debating whether to do it tomorrow.  In another round of hell, tomorrow is MY birthday and we're supposed to go out for dinner.  Happy fucking birthday to me.",QAnonCasualties
464,Am I in the right place?,"Hi, everyone.

I'm new to Reddit, having joined today to check out QAnonCasualties, after reading a great, but emotional and sobering article about this subreddit, and it really resonated with me.

In summary, I have a stepmother, who is now fully bought into Trumpism. My elderly father, who has cognitive difficulties, goes along with it, though he probably is not as personally dedicated to those sets of beliefs. Our once-close relationship is now near the point of non-existence.

I'd like to post and discuss more details about this, and most of all commiserate with people in a similar situation. First, though, I want to ask if this is the right subreddit for that, as I do not know if they are into QAnon, in addition to Trumpism. If this is not the right place for that, I'd certainly appreciate any pointers to other subreddits.

Thank you,

465,medbeds??? wtf,"is anyone else’s Q person talking about these magical “medbeds” and how it’s peak medicine of the future coming?? my Qmom tried showing me a video about it, and i was gonna sit through it just to appease her until i saw a picture of the letter Q pop up and i told her i didn’t wanna see it anymore. she got mad and asked why, but i didn’t feel like picking a fight so i just said i didn’t feel like it. she then starts to guilt trip me by saying “well i’m just not gonna talk to you/tell you about anything anymore” or “i can never show you anything anymore, don’t you wanna learn?” etc., so now we’re sitting in silence while she has her earbud in watching it 🙄 i’m so done.",QAnonCasualties
466,How concerned should I be about by boyfriend?,"Hi! I’m so glad I found this group because I need some support from people with similar experiences. My heart breaks when I read about the broken families here, and I fear I may be facing a similar tragedy.

I’d like to get some perspectives on how concerned I should be about my boyfriend at this point. How can I tell when it’s time for an intervention, or if I need to get out of the relationship?

My BF is a kindhearted 60-year old man who was taken in by the Trump cult. He did vote for Obama 2008, but for some reason he became fervently anti-Obama after that (I’m guessing because of the social circle he was in). Knowing he’s life experiences, I can understand why the MAGA message resonates with him. I do respect his views, and he respects mine. But it scares me to think that he might continue to blindly follow Trump even further into the abyss. After all, Trump spouts QAnon nonsense, and he may become even more extreme now that he lost the election and was acquitted in the impeachment trial.

He doesn’t follow QAnon, per se, but is exposed to messaging that comes through in his newsfeeds (OAN, Newsmax, Fox, Facebook). I’m pretty confident that the most extreme claims would be too much for him to stomach. For example, he wouldn’t buy into the Pizzagate or Wayfair pedophilia lies, or the idea that school shootings are staged.

He believes everyone is against Trump because he stopped people from making money on wars and other political corruption. I have never heard him refer to the “deep state”, though.

He hasn’t said straight out that the election “was stolen”, but does believe there is widespread voter fraud (illegals being able to vote, etc.). Still believes Trump won the popular vote 2016. He has accepted that Biden is now the president and says he wants him to succeed. But he also believes much of the “socialist” scaremongering. He called Biden’s many executive orders “dictatorial”! He believes all the lies about the Biden family, including the one about Hunter’s laptop.

He often brings up the child trafficking thing, but I think he might have softened a little bit on that after I gave him some facts about it. The other night, though, he said “I don’t like that guy” about Tom Hanks. I realized later it was because of the pedophilia rumors.

He railed against the violence that took place last summer, but says nothing about the Capitol riots. Early on he hinted that it might have been Antifa/BLM who entered the Capitol, but I’m not sure what he thinks now–and I’m afraid to ask! To be fair, he wouldn’t condone violence from any side.

He really hates white supremacists, though, and I can tell he's sincere about that. He says he believes that everybody, regardless of race or sexual orientation, is equal and should be treated with the same respect. And he is indeed respectful to everyone he meets. But on the other hand, he holds views that I find disturbing and are based on misinformation from the far right. For example, he really dislikes the BLM movement and believes that racism is a thing of the past. His view is that the protesters are asking for “special treatment”, not equality. Similar thing with the LGBTQ movement.

He thought that Covid was deliberately spread by China and that the California wildfires were started by Antifa people (doesn’t seem to believe in human caused climate change). I think he might have soften his views on these subjects as well, as he’s seeing the Covid situation play out.

Is there hope for a guy like him, who is on the fringe of the fringe, so to speak? He seems to have a crack open where it’s possible to get to him, and he is open to hearing my thoughts. In fact, he specifically states that “we are not enemies”. But how could I tell if he’s actually more radical or closed up than he lets on? Could he be hiding his worst tendencies because he knows how I feel? I need some outside perspectives on this, please!",QAnonCasualties
467,A message to my mother,"I’ve had this rolling around in my head for some time now and felt like I needed to say it to my mom. She’s fallen down the Q hole obviously. I wrote it out but can’t get myself to send it. Maybe all I needed was to write it down. Anyways, for context, the latest thing she sent me was something saying that the snow in Texas wouldn’t melt and is fake and is part of some Chinese operation to modify the weather. I thought that I could share it with this group:


That snow thing is so wrong and I’m so sick of seeing stupid shit like that being peddled by these idiots. I can tell you why it’s wrong but I doubt you want to hear it because you seem intent of filling your mind with this crap. And then on top of it you will not allow yourself to absorb any shred of logical information because you believe that anything that doesn’t fulfill your confirmation bias is a product of a society that is hell-bent on deceiving you. 

I’m putting boundaries on this. I don’t want to see any of this anymore. You have proven yourself incapable of vetting any of this information and therefore I don’t want to see any of it. There is no deep state-sponsored pedophilia ring. There is no Q. There is no elitist adrenachrome market. Trump is not the president. He will not be the president on March 4th. There is no financial reset. The vaccines are not designed to exterminate or otherwise control the population. None of this stuff has come true. None of it.

What there is is an imperfect world. Yes pedophiles exist. Yes people do some fucked up things. Yes some politicians are corrupt and have ulterior motives. Science is messy and rarely straightforward. And there are trolls out there that see an opportunity in that and take delight in seeing the world turn on itself. 

QAnon is a disease. I have joined a group of almost 135,000 people that is for individuals who have lost someone to QAnon. Friends, siblings, partners, spouses. And it is endless. 30+ year marriages ruined. Friendships alienated. Parents and their children disowning one another. People committing SUICIDE because they’re terrified of what they think is coming. These people have the same behavior patterns as addicts and it seems like there is nothing that their loved ones can do about it except hope and pray that they snap out of it before more damage is done. 

QAnon preys on people. It preys on their insecurities. It prays on their traumas. It preys on their religion. It tells them that all of their problems are from the design of a singular sinister force and then it gives them a false hope that soon everything will be over and some alternate reality will replace the one we have today. But it’s just that. False hope. The goalposts will always be moved. You will constantly be disappointed in the outcome until you realize that none of this is real. There will always be some reason, some plan, some story as to why what “they” say is happening, doesn’t happen.

This cult has built a self-affirming echo chamber around itself and its followers. Everyone is constantly searching for the “truth” and shouting into a dark room what they think they no. Meanwhile any light from the outside is shut out. It is bad for you. It will deceive you. Don’t look at it, look at what we have to say. Trust the plan. Bullshit. That’s just a thought terminating clause meant stop people from applying reason and logic and emotion to the situation. It’s meant to keep them at bay and blindly following a leaderless conglomeration of lost ideas. 

I’ve tried to keep up with Q. I wanted to stay informed on what had you in its grips because I care about you. But I’ve taken a mental health break from it. Because I get SO ANGRY at the sheer fallacy of the things being preached and knowing that my own mother is right there cheering it on. And I’m terrified that this will come between you and dad. So yes, I am choosing ignorance and hoping I find some bliss. With that, I ask you to not share any of this stuff with me. I will not enable it.

472,Now that I've read a bit...,"My mom &amp; brother are big Trump supporters. My mom to the point that I can't talk negatively about him. She actually gasped &amp; said I was to respect him just because he was my president, whether I like him or not when I told her I couldn't stand him &amp; that he was NOT ""MY"" president.

I recently saw on her FB page that she ""likes"" Fox news &amp; Breitbart. I asked her in text if she believed in ""all of that Q stuff"" &amp; her response was ""I have my own mind"". (Not ""No"").

Knowing, from speaking with people online who are so angry and defensive whenever you try to calmly debate about Trump, that the most aggressive are Q supporters, I'm really worried about my mom.

473,I have deradicalized my grandmother,"Definitely some good news on my end. A little bit of a backstory, my grandma was always conservative and she grew up as a devout Mormon. However over the past two years, I noticed a shift in her mentality. Not much I could really say other than she was spouting crazy right wing conspiracies and her entire existence became political. As a result, it damaged my view on her considerably. I always ignored her facebook posts, but a month back, she said something I could not ignore. She posted an image about Nazi Germany which was flat out incorrect on multiple fronts. Being the kind of person who hates historical revisionism, I took the time to correct every statement the image made and as a result, her conservative cousin agreed with me on that. This I believe caused her to go down the path of normalcy. She took a break from facebook and came back changed.

So I wanted to share this with you guys that there is hope and people can deradicalize. That is not to say that I think everyone in Q can be saved and in some cases shouldn't be attempted. These people attempted to overthrow our democracy. I think people should distance themselves from anyone who is advocating for violence, but there are a lot of people who are not in that camp and effort should be made to bring them back.",QAnonCasualties

I've seen countless posts here about how Qanon's ruined relationships, families, reputations.... I feel it's a much bigger problem then most unknowing people would expect. It wouldn't be an easy task but I think maybe one step towards fixing this is if we had programs to combat it. Perhaps support groups or a hotline or something to that effect?",QAnonCasualties
475,LET ME TELL YOU HOW I DODGED A BULLET,"Me (M-born 1969) s my Mother (born 1946)

She was a narcissistic bully to the max!  Very intelligent at scamming people but also so god damn stupid with getting scammed herself.

How does that happen?

Anyway... I lived a nightmare childhood that consisted of the dregs of society sleeping in my bedroom, eating any food I could ever find in my house... I grew up neglected in every way imaginable.   My father was actually not so bad.  However, when I was about 5 years old I remember my mother rehearsed me on a script to make him out as a violent sexual deviant when she was going to court for child support.

Meanwhile, I grew up in a flophouse for alcoholics and heroin addicts.  I somehow graduated high school and immediately joined the US ARMY.  18 years old at BASIC TRAINING in the US ARMY in Ft Leonard Wood, MS was the first time in my life I was ever introduced to breakfast, lunch and dinner.    I'm 5'8 tall.   All of the other kids in the extended family are over 6ft.

476,My relationship with my parents is gone,"My parents have totally subscribed to everything Q, just without putting a name to it. COVID was invented by Fauci, Trump is a savior trying to stop Hollywood’s secret pedo ring, Biden is actually the devil, everything bad is socialism and communism, BLM was racist and destructive, Bill Gates is a satanist, climate change is a hoax, the vaccines will mess with your DNA, etc. Any evidence against what they believe is just “fake news” or “controlled by the mainstream media.” You guys know the drill.

I’m financially tied to them. I’m in college, and I’m very grateful that I’m in the position to have my school, books, insurance, etc. fully paid for. My parents are well off, not multi-millionaires, but definitely upper middle class. I wanna reiterated that I’m thankful to them for providing for me so well, but I can’t keep disrespecting myself and believing them when they say, “Don’t disrespect us (aka disagree with us), we didn’t HAVE TO pay for you stuff.” I guess they didn’t HAVE TO, but they’re my fucking parents. This is the bare minimum if it’s in their means, which it is.

We can’t talk anymore. Because inevitably something political will come up and my dad in particular can’t help himself. He has something medically wrong with his brain (I’m not insulting him, it’s true, I just don’t wanna go into the actually details), and his decision-making and social filter is kinda messed up. At first I would actively participate in the discussion. When they would make some crazy comment, I would do my research and then try to correct them. But, of course, it was never just that. One little comment from them and one correction from me would turn into hours long, heated, unconstructive arguments. 

My dad’s awful to argue with. He’s the yell-over someone, don’t listen, invalidate people with ad hominems, alt right debater. I’m not perfect, but at least I don’t say someone’s wrong just because they’re younger than me. You can point this out, but he’ll just say “That’s not true!” even though it got to the point I would secretly record him doing exactly what he denies. It doesn’t matter. If he says it’s not true, then suddenly it’s not true. I’ll admit, I’m jealous that I don’t have that kind of magical power.

This came to a head one day when I left the room crying and angry. I locked myself in my room until my mom, who also is a crazy Q subscriber but not as aggressive as my dad, tried to get me to come back out. “I talked with your father, and we both promise to not bring up anything political with you.” I didn’t believe it, but what was I gonna do? Starve in my room? I want you to guess how long my parents abided by this promise. A day? Two days?

About three hours.

I left and locked myself in my room again. That was last year, and now I’m back with them for a bit because they needed my help with stuff. My car’s in the shop so I have no escape while I’m in this house. I was under the impression the agreement was still tentatively in affect, even though I knew they weren’t gonna abide by it. Yeah, I’m an idiot. My mom asked me not to get the vaccine. Absolutely stupid, but not political yet, so I stayed in the living room. Then gas prices got brought up. And then there I was. “Fucking Biden did this. He’s ruining America.” I got up and went to my room again.

My mom knocked on my door and basically called me an over-sensitive snowflake who can’t bother to stay in the room when anything political came up. What they don’t seem to realize is that it wasn’t really about politics anymore. Yeah, of course I wish I could change their mind, but it’s not my problem anymore. Maybe that’s toxic of me for not trying harder, but I endured endless months of angry, abusive, gaslighting arguments that destroyed my spirit. I don’t care what they believe in anymore. I just didn’t want to hear it/get into more arguments.

No, to me at least, politics didn’t make me leave the room. The fact that they can’t respect me did. I don’t ask them for anything apart from paying for my school and living expenses. It’s a lot, which makes me question if maybe I DO owe them something. But no. They have the money to take care of their own child. They can’t keep gaslighting me into self-destructive states of constant guilt for this. 

I asked them for one simple thing. When I’m around, just don’t bring up politics. It’s not only for my own mental well-being but also because I thought it would save whatever was left of our relationship. They couldn’t do it because they respect Q more than their daughter. Maybe that’s not how they see it, but it doesn’t matter. That’s what I see.

My dad went off the wall that night. He called me a pedo-loving hypocrite. He said I hate black people (?). He said I called him “stupid” and made fun of his brain problems, even though I just said something like “You don’t understand.” He paced up and down the hallways, just yelling. Then he came back to my room and told me he was trying to inform me of stuff because I’m young and he loves me and wants me to be on the right side. He gets all his facts not from the crooked mainstream media, but from real people. People on places like tik tok and Facebook. At this point, I just nodded along and kept saying okay. This went on for 30 minutes, just him telling me all his crazy conspiracies again under the guise of “I’m just trying to inform you.” 

He calls me closed-minded, but I can’t tell him anything without him just flat out saying I’m wrong. There I was just being spewed at for half an hour. I guess I am close-minded because I just stopped listening.

The agreement is off now, not that it was ever really on. My dad hates liars and people who break their promises. He calls me a hypocrite and says what I did (vote for Biden) will destroy our family. My mom threatened to cut me off financially. But then they wanted to pretend to be a family again, so I was forced to come out in the living room again and pretend everything was okay. I was sobbing uncontrollably but after a few minutes I had to talk with them like nothing was wrong.

I don’t wanna type anymore. I’m just at this point disgusted and exhausted with my parents. I can’t escape both physically and mentally. They’re gonna keep regurgitating alt-right, Q bullshit, and I’m just gonna turn into a bobble head and nod along. I don’t have a real relationship with my parents. They’re right when they call me a liar. I don’t know that when I say I love them if I mean it anymore. It’s really hard. I’ll be back to my apartment as soon as my car is fixed.

477,What do you do about...,"a friend or relative who is so far down the rabbit hole on this Qanon conspiracy nonsense that they *insist* that Donald Trump is still president -- not ""going to be"" or ""the rightful,"" etc., I mean: believes that the entire media is lying to them with propaganda reports and even ""deep fake"" videos. This now includes Fox and NewsMax as allegedly fake news, something I never thought I'd hear from the right.

I'm asking because my father can't hold on a two-minute conversation without railing against Democrats in Washington with all of the most outlandish conspiracy theories (this is in stark contrast with other friends and family I have who are legitimate Republicans with legitimate disagreements and criticisms of Democrats). 

Ironically, he'll believe anything reported that is critical of politicians like Nancy Pelosi and then refuse to believe something from the same source that is fairly universally agreed upon as the existence of ""President Biden."" 

This is someone who wouldn't attend any Jan 6th or March 4th protests because he is either too poor and too far away or he doesn't believe that there needs to be a protest for something that he doesn't believe has even happened 🤔 I can't make the least bit of sense of his logic, and any request for a primary or corroborating credible source is met with a furious response...

I've tried steering clear of religion and politics with him, but his brain obsesses about these topics and they're intertwined in EVERYTHING he says and does. I'm not exaggerating about him not being able to go two minutes without bringing it up...

I just cannot go on listening to the scary chemtrails that are controlling our minds, vaccine that will kill us....on and on.  We have stopped all communication.

If I do text back to one of the 30+ articles, paragraphs, theories I get a day (that I mostly never read), I get extremely triggered and angry. Like....angry, angry. So, I have told myself a lot to not allow him to ruin my day. To not allow him to disturb my peace, to steal my joy, etc, etc. But after a particularly hurtful text today, I decided to not shove away the feelings &amp; they quickly dissipated into sadness. I ended up just allowing myself to cry over this shit. Because it’s absolute bullshit. Mental illness aside. Maybe I would have had a few more years with him if it weren’t for Trump. Maybe it would have taken something in the future to devolve him into this person. Maybe he could have been an Uncle a little longer. These are the thoughts lurking behind the anger and I realize they’re just....sad.

483,My Qbrother keeps trying to convert me.,"So, I already posted about my brother in the past, but for those who didn't see my first post, I'll tell my story again, and I'll add the new developments.   


My brother has been a QAnon believer for a while now. I didn't know but apparently he was a Trump supporter for a while too (he even voted for the Cheeto in 2016). In the last quarter of 2020, I created a WhatsApp group to try to stay in touch with my family through video calls since we all live in different states and countries. Everything was ok until he misunderstood something I said as me repeating some QAnon theory and he just started spewing shit about the satanic liberals torturing children to live forever. The rest of us were like WTF? but at that point, I didn't know anything about QAnon. Things got worse after Biden's victory when he started trying to convert us (my other brother who is an enabler who adopts an agreeing posture to his crazy talk saying ""well, everything is possible"", and my dad and I who just ignored him) telling us stuff about how Trump was coming back, or the big blackout that is coming. 

He stopped using WhatsApp because of the new privacy rules. On January 8th, after he sent me some crap about WikiLeaks through Facebook messenger, I politely asked him for him and his wife (who is a pastel QAnon who believes is an extraterrestrial being of light) to stop send me QAnon conspiracy bullshit. He simply just responded with a 👍.

Then he sent me more crap about the Pope being arrested via Signal. I just ignored him. Now he started sending me and my other brother (the enabler) text messages with links with more conspiracy theory fake news and ""experts"".

The problem is that every time I get one of these I get upset, I spent hours ruminating, I vent with my wife, who then also gets upset. I need to find a way for him to stop, but I feel that if I ask him politely again, he will simply ignore it, but I don't know what would happen if I ask him in a more rough way. I fear that if I do that it would create even more chaos.

The thing is that I want to tell him to fuck off. I want to tell him that he is using all this QAnon shit as a bad coping mechanism, to avoid dealing with the fact that he is not the young athletic free-spirited man he used to be, that he is now older than 50, has health problems, hates his job, thinks that his children are losers and that he failed as a father, and that he is married to a woman that he doesn't love. I want to tell him that he is repeating the same mistakes he did during his first marriage when he allowed a woman who he didn't love to make him believe in bullshit (at that time he even changed his religion and adopted all the beliefs of his wife). I want to tell him that he is not super awake now, he is just coping really bad.

But then again, I suppose that telling him all these things would make things worse.",QAnonCasualties

486,Gaslighting myself and I can't be the only one,"One thing I'd love to see more of on here (that's on me, so here goes!) is how losing multiple people to this Q phenomenon has made *me* feel crazy, has made *me* question everything, has made *me* feel like maybe I am the one who is brainwashed, am I the one who is stupid... because my Qs aren't stupid. They're well educated. In one particular instance, it's someone I love and and who I looked up to. I'm doing my best not to pass judgment or be too smug because I just never know what kind of crap I've been led to believe throughout the years. I'd take comfort in the fact that I'm a skeptic but it seems like skepticism is also the Quriosity that kills the cat!

It's become so ubiquitous in my community, in my industry that it requires serious effort to be around it almost daily anymore. I'm speaking mostly about a professional setting and I'm doing my damnedest not to out myself here, but I have to remain completely and utterly professional around Q folk, one of whom is distinguishing himself rather rapidly lately and being given a lot of, er, let's say *airtime* to talk about his views which he keeps very, very thinly concealed around large groups and not at all concealed around me and a few other mutual contacts on our team. I'm supposed to be strong and capable and not create any conflict around it in order to keep my standing in my field. It's getting more and more difficult.

I even had one colleague on our team recently who, despite my best efforts to conceal my disdain, reach out to me unprompted(!!!) to ""help me understand"" our Qolleague's ""point of view,"" even though she didn't feel that way and is *(or was?)* more aligned with my thinking on these matters. So basically I'm trying to be tolerant, because that's my job, and it's becoming obvious to people I'm even failing at that!!! (You can read my face like a book unfortunately, it never lies, dammit Zoom, LOL.)

I've been visiting this sub more frequently as a result just to remain sane. I'm happy to say most of my close family and the members of my household are fantastic support, and for that I am lucky and quite privileged, but there are days when I feel really upset and lost and *crazy af*.

This is my first post on here. I'm extremely scared to even do that, I'm obviously a Reddit newb and I'm so, so afraid of somehow doing something wrong or saying the wrong thing, etc. because I've seen some really mean stuff on here (but not on this sub, thankfully.)

488,Fiance just admitted he believes in Q,"I am new to this as of 30 minutes ago, and I’m still in shock. Sorry for the length of this post. 

I am 51, divorced, and have been dating someone for almost 2 years. We have always had differences of opinion re Trump, but he wanted to avoid talking about it entirely to keep the peace. In the past 6 months or so, he has been getting angrier, quicker to lash out, emotionally distant, almost depressed. It was much worse after Trump lost the election. He didn’t talk about it at all, and blamed his moodiness on a leg injury and surgery that has kept him down for most of the last 10 months. I have been struggling to cope with his moods. In the last month he has turned into another person entirely. 

Last night he sent me a text asking if I thought we could get past our differences for the long term. I responded by saying “not if we stay on the same path...but if we can change the path, and you value me above Trump, then maybe, yes...”

He didn’t respond until hours later, around 2 am. Then he let loose with multiple very long texts that shocked me. I am not including all of their content for the sake of space, but here is the final part:

HIM: “Conspiracy theories? Look no further than Russia collusion. All lies, never proven. I will support Donald Trump in the future, as I know he will have a lot to do with the party going forward. This is not a debate about him or if he will or if he won't. I refuse to live in a household with you or anyone, it would make me want to feel bad for supporting him. I know clearing well the election was stolen, you have a fraudulent president sitting in the White House. He will wreck the economy and send it spiraling, back to the old ways of Obama, putting illegal immigrants first over Americans. 

You will always be someone that I would say to myself, wonder what she's up to these days. 

And don't give me some excuse about an insurrection on January 6th. It's awful what happened, but those were not Trump supporters. They were actors, it's been proven, I've seen the footage. I know people that were actually there and they even said they were not Trump supporters. Just remember this optics are everything.”

(BACK TO ME) I woke up with this series of texts waiting for me. I was in such shock that I just replied with a question. This is the whole interaction that followed. 

ME: Do you believe in Q?

HIM: WWG1WGA

ME: And that means...?

HIM: Yes I believe in Q. 

ME: For how long?

HIM: Probably about the last 8-10 months. 

ME: Thank you for telling me more about yourself. 


No additional reply from him so far. What I have copied and pasted here is the entire series of texts from 2 am until now, with the exception of cutting the initial texts from him to save space. It is mainly ranting about main stream media. 

The 8-10 months corresponds to his leg injury, so I can see a connection between being cut off from work colleagues and the real world, which I understand is a starting point for many Q believers. The timeline of how I have seen him change for the worse makes complete sense now. For example, he never made racist comments at all for the first year. He was actually a great guy. Then he started with racist comments here and there which I always called him out on. Now he is calling covid the China flu and other anti-Chinese, anti-Immigrant and anti-Black statements, like being against BLM. He has called me an extreme leftist (I am a moderate liberal). This is all new behavior. 

He is an intelligent guy, and seemed very grounded in reality before, so finding out he is Q is such a shock to me. It feels like finding out that the mild mannered reporter that I thought I was dating has a secret double life as a super villain. 

I am sitting here knowing that this relationship must be over. I’m mourning the person that I originally fell in love with, not this new guy. They are two different people, and it seems like it didn’t take that long to make the transformation. I want to believe that there is some kind of sci-fi parasite that has invaded him and is controlling his behavior, and that if a treatment is found to shock the parasite to come crawling out of his ear (a “Supernatural”storyline), then he (and we) will be back to normal.

Despite that, I don’t think he’s as far gone as others i’ve seen. 

The other day, he sent me a video of Joe Biden signing his first few executive orders. In the video he mutters something inaudible and Kamala mutters something back as she moves one of his big books to the side so he can sign the next one.

BF sends me this video in a literal panic. He says, “Did Joe Biden just say ‘I have no idea what I’m signing’ and Kamala responds ‘Just sign it’ on national TV?!?”

.... and I say no, Brad, he doesn’t. In fact, you can’t even hear what they’re saying — and even if you could, do you think they’d say that shit on national TV, where everyone could see them? 

I asked him, “What are we doing here? Are we really trying to CSI-enhance audio bullshit to try and catch Biden saying something stupid that doesn’t even make any sense? We’re being no better than the fucking Ghost Hunters shows where they put up a little phrase next to an inaudible ‘EVP’ to try and convince you they caught a ghost voice.”

He muttered under his breath and said “I guess. But I still think he’s unfit.” 

What can I do? Is there *anything* i can do? I feel like it’s a good thing he’s coming to me with these things despite knowing i’m as libby as they come. I love him, he just lacks critical thinking with politics. He treats politics like it’s an ARG Youtube mystery series.

491,Is my boyfriend's family going to get better or worse with time?,"My boyfriend's dad is slowly becoming more and more actively racist and it's getting weird. He's always had a certain bias - he was uncomfortable when his daughter dated a half-black guy for a while, but he let her and was polite and friendly on the surface. I bet he would complain a lot more today. He has one black friend at work that he's friends with who he said is ""one of the good ones"" because she also thinks the races shouldn't mix, and doesn't support interracial marriage either. And she's funny and nice, apparently.

Right before the Superbowl aired, he was complaining about how they only gave it to The Weeknd because he's black, how he doesn't like Beyoncé because ""she's racist"", and she supports the Black Panthers which are ""the most racist group of all time"" (???). ""They were like the KKK but for black people."" He recently bought a Proud Boys hoodie the other day and he's been wearing that around the house, and said they had ""good ideas"" and that we should ""look them up"".

His wife and the extended family are somehow worse about it, so I guess it's not a surprise. She said, on one extremely memorable car ride, that ""slavery wasn't even that bad, it gave them employment"". About a year ago, she called her sister an ""n***** lover"" because she dated black dudes for a while. Sometime in January, she sent a qanon video in their family groupchat. It was a bunch of weird propaganda about the dawn of a new era on January 20th, how everything was gonna be different, and it ended with a Qanon slogan pasted at the bottom of the screen. 

Both of his parents voted for Trump (obviously) and convinced their daughter to do it too, a girl who literally didn't know what the word ""liberal"" meant until a few years ago AND who also had a brief flat-earther phase that lasted a good month and a half.

My main question is, are my boyfriend's parents going to get worse over the next few years, or is this gonna gonna fizzle out? Neither of his parents talk about it extensively and my boyfriend and I do our best to steer any conversation away from politics. Their house isn't covered with MAGA and Q-themed decorations. Aside from the confederate flag in the basement, it's a pretty normal home. I don't think it's a dire situation like the stories I read on this subreddit, and we're set to move out soonish anyway.

However, they are undying, major 100% Trump supporters who espouse the same beliefs as QAnon. Deep state government... Pedophile ring (and Joe Biden is a pedophile)... The election was rigged/stolen... The Capital raid was Antifa—the media just wants us to THINK it was Trump supporters... The COVID vaccine is a government tracking device. COVID is fake—deaths are overblown. And my parents are both immune to COVID, anyway—the doctor gave them hydrochloroquine and told them both they’re now immune! And so what if my dad has a heart condition and Type II diabetes— he just had his annual physical, and the doctor said he was very healthy! A few months ago, my dad was talking about how face masks don’t do anything. I responded by saying the next time he has surgery, to make sure he insists that the surgeon and all of the surgical staff DO NOT wear face masks. (Finally something that made him stop and think for a minute.) And me having a personal secondhand connection to four COVID deaths? There was something else going on with those deaths.

She's always been a ""crunchy"" or natural parent, which I am also to a certain extent, and this I think led her down the rabbit hole of being anti vax. Then Covid came along and she was alternating between ""it's not real"" and ""it's no worse than the flu"", and completely anti lockdown and masks. (Ironic, since she homeschools her kids and hardly goes anywhere.) She really boarded the crazy train when she started talking about microchips in the Covid vaccine and following it up by diving into the pedophile thing and strongly supporting Trump even after he left office, plus too much more to list. She unfriended me months ago on FB when I told her she was nuts for talking about microchips in the vaccines, but basically all her posts on FB are public so I've been keeping up with them periodically. She quit posting on FB for a while (I assume she moved to Parler) and then came back right around the time Parler shut down.

I'm just really sad. I'm mourning her like someone who is dead, except if she had died I would still at least be able to see her kids! Her husband I think is not Q, he's always just sort of let her have whatever crazy schemes/ideas she wants while not getting sucked in.

I've been really hesitant to share my story until recently because I realized my desire to stay private and calm for my sanity and safety is no longer worth shielding when it comes to watching people go through the same things I did. I was raised in a violent cult and escaped less than a decade ago. **IT DID NOT START THAT WAY**. They rarely do. They fade to violence to test a person's loyalty more often that not (several tiers up from the recruitment process). This is also where many people leave, but only after they see the impacts their violence had on their loved ones. By then, the damage has been done. Violence against the self is the common starter (they need you to tear yourself apart, become unworthy of their love and 'membership', so that 'you' can be rebuilt in their image) and then it moves to violence against others, both mind and body. 

I still have huge and deep scars on my body that remind me, daily, of what they people are capable of if crossed in the wrong way. This is all very familiar to me. I went through many years of recovery, still suffer flashbacks and dissociative episodes, amnesia, etc. Because I am well aware of this cult and how it's running the same course as many others that have become violent, I wanted to take a few minutes to share links to resources from the toolbox of some of my specialists that were shared with me. They helped me escape, stay grounded against attacks, and still help me with my recovery.*\**

Just a reminder to those that are in houses with QAnon members that have become abusive or violent (especially if you've chosen to not follow), this has **all** the signs of a dangerous cult. Just because they're friends or family does NOT mean they won't harm you. Things are done to a person's brain inside these cults, they utilize methods of 'turning off' empathy, they use isolation as a tactic to separate you from your loved ones (especially if they've chosen to not follow), they use a 'devalue' and 'discard' tactic to keep you within a circle of people 'approved' to socialize with, and so much more.

DIVIDE AND CONCUR is the main method, because if you're reminded that you love that person, you're less likely to 'turn off' the empathy that's required for you to then harm a person. We have seen this before in history books and it's working the same way. Denial will be your main coping mechanism to handle this, but it's also the emotion that will keep you stuck.

I just quickly wrote this out, sorry if there are any typos or broken links. I cannot talk about this topic for long, so I've got to go. Love to you all! Stay strong, practice your critical thinking, practice grounding, stay informed on the methods these cults us to recruit, trust your gut, etc. *xoxo*

504,Lost a good friend after a hurtful exchange.,"I work in a city that is much like any southern state: a blue oasis in the deep red. There aren’t many young people that work in manufacturing and I’ve always had great company in the older folks that work here ( I am in my late 20s, most people who work with me are 40+) 

This friend of mine has always been very conservative and I’ve had plenty of conversations with him in the past about hot button issues like Climate change etc., and even though we didn’t always agree on things, we respected each other. 

Our conversations have gotten testy after the Inauguration to the point where we had loud exchanges at work and I decided to not mention any of these topics moving forward. I could sense an anger building up in him with certain things he says such as “Open your eyes and look at the truth, folks like y’all are ruining this country”. 

We stopped talking anything other than work until last week when he texted me a meme made by Fox News that claimed Texas power outage was entirely to be blamed on Liberal agenda and windmills. I casually responded with a link to an article that showed the data and how it’s false to pin the blame on renewable energy. At this point, he texted me back saying: “I am sick and tired of punks destroying this land of ours, you were fine until your yankee connection screwed with your head”. 

I recently got engaged to my girlfriend of 4 years who is originally from NY. I don’t expect anyone to be happy for my decisions, but I sure as heck don’t appreciate snarky comments about my family or family to be. I can’t cut ties with this person since we work together, but this relationship is beyond repair.",QAnonCasualties

506,Q and Church?,"Hello yall, 

Been a lurker for quite some time as Ive tried grappling with Q infiltrating my family around the COVID outbreak. Parents were birthers so them voting for Trump was no big surprise, the shift in who raised me was the bigger shock. 

Anyways, I used to volunteer for some non denominational churches (the hipster pastor kind) and recently saw a comment from one of the band members on a very conservative Outlet’s post and saying some sort of kooky things. It got me wondering: how much is Q being shared within churches like this all over the country? 

(Yes I realize evangelicals love Q but for some reason I had naively assumed the new age churches might not fall prey to it. These are 30 year olds, not boomers btw.)

Apologies if this has already been discussed to death.",QAnonCasualties
507,My Q Mom has HIV and is not well. Her Church is turning her against her children.,"My Mom was diagnosed with HIV in 1993. She has had surgeries for precancerous cells in her IG and has lost 80 pounds in the last 10 years. She's not well and knows she's not long for this world.  We grew up Catholic but we all stopped going to church a while ago. She has recently ( in the last 5 years or so) joined this cult like Born again Christian ✝️ church. It's called Calvary Christian Church. I looked them up and found out they are like rhe McDonald's of churches. Pop up in strip malls all over the US. They seek out drug addicted, and people in pain, dying, etc. Anyway. This churches leader is. Qcumber and he now has turned his entire congregation into Q members, including my Mother. I am a Democrat because my Mom was. She gave me my values as a child. I am mixed because she isn't a racist! Now she says things that I feel are racist statements.  She is always angry and blames lazy people that won't get up and go to work and wanna live off the system.  She doesn't trust the government at all. She won't use USPS anymore because she thinks they will steal her packages. She talks about abortion all the time.  She had an abortion like 46 years ago. She helped me when I had to do it once during a very abusive relationship. She posts the crazy babay eater memes on FB and constantly wants to argue with me when I tell her she's crazy and those are lies. I have brother that is going to that church too. He's a Trump supporter, but doesn't act like she does. Doesn't discuss politics at all. At least with me. Could he be influencing her?
I miss my supportive smart Mom. I'm thinking maybe she's latching to the church because she's dying.  But why the Q stuff? 
Any insight would help.",QAnonCasualties
508,Thinking of giving up on your QAnon relative? Maybe try this,"I recently suggested some advice about how to use cats to deprogram your loved ones via YouTube and Facebook etc. [You can find that post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/ln1aql/deprogram_your_loved_one_using_facebook_and/).

This time I would like to offer an idea for those of you who are thinking about abandoning your QAnon relative, whether you have tried alternative methods to help them out of the cult or not. Honestly, you know your situation and your loved one best, strangers like me on the Internet can only speak in general terms and hope that our ideas might help. Take it all, try what you think might work, but you do you.

**The power of the Letter**

Indulge me for a second while I prattle on...

Years ago, when I was a struggling art student unsure what career path I should work towards and living on a diet of cigarettes, cheap beer and pot noodles, I considered a commercial graphic design path and did a little work toward it. My tutor looked at my portfolio and said 'You need to be different'. I didn't know what she meant at first, I thought 'Great, she's told me to completely change my artistic style', but she explained that the people hiring someone like me are looking through a thousand portfolios just like mine and if I want to get over that first hurdle I needed to stand out.

If you're trying to connect with the family member sucked into Q you're competing with a thousand online voices all yelling and screaming things that your loved one either wants to hear or feels driven toward. 

Chances are if you attempt to talk to them about this they'll spiral quickly into a well-practiced tirade, regurgitating all the posts they read that day, calling you a 'sheep' for not agreeing with their unfounded beliefs, comparing sourced and documented reality to what their Facebook friend they've never met told them they read on a forum and how that must be true because... you can't get a word in and if you could they probably wouldn't listen, because they don't want to.

You end up thinking you should just abandon them to their new cult, for your own sanity.

As I said before I was once on the side of abandoning them because it's too much work even for trained psychologists, deprogramming someone is A LOT to take on.

My opinion is that you should at least try a few things, and if nothing has worked and you can no longer communicate with them, finish with a letter.

And yes, I mean an actual, hand-written, physical letter in ink and on paper. Why? Because that stands out. It's personal, you put effort into it, it's not just another screed of words on the internet like this wall of text. They actually have to physically open it, away from their screen, away from distractions, and see the written words you have sent them.

They can't delete you, they can't block you, they can't shout you down, they can't run away. Sure, they could just rip it up, but you and I both know they'll read it all first.

**What to write**

First of all, don't attack them. Don't belittle their beliefs. Don't accuse them of anything.

Be honest. Tell them that you love them and that you miss them. Tell them that you're scared. It's okay to let them know that their behavioral changes have been frightening. It's okay to admit you've had to distance yourself from them for your own mental well-being or to protect your own immediate loved ones from what they've become (note: don't call them a threat to your kids, make clear it's about the person they have become and that your responsibility is to your kids etc). Tell them that you've tried to talk to them and it hasn't worked, that you've spent time wondering how you can help them to come back to the people who love them but it doesn't seem possible without their willingness to do so.

You can probably think of a lot of things to say to them that you haven't been able to without them cutting you off or shouting you down. **Just remember to be loving and understand that they are a victim in all this, too.**

Next, detail how your separation is going to be. Whether you're completely cutting them off or mostly distancing yourself from them you owe them an explanation of what this will mean. I would personally set a six month or one year time frame in which things might change and you might be able to reconnect again, if they've moved on from where they are now.

If it's your parent, especially if it's your mother, maybe suggest nine months of separation. It's not subtle but it could have a real impact. This could trigger the various emotional memories they have of carrying you and it might nudge them to remember what their priorities were.

Give them an opportunity to change. Don't give them a deadline but say you need this time before they make contact again, and that they should only do so if they feel they have moved on from the person they are right now.

You don't need to say that if they don't change in that time you'll be gone again. This is suggested already and writing it would sound like an ultimatum or threat, and that won't help anything.

Finish with a memory.

Think long and hard about something you both shared, a vacation, a party or a family meal. Try to think of something they can connect with, rather than something that you connect with and might miss the mark with them. Remind them of a happier time and tell them that you'd like to get back to that one day but you can only do that if they're willing to.

Offer resources for them. These people do not believe they are suffering from a mental health crisis, but they most certainly are and you're not serving them well by ignoring it. If nothing else it gives them an explanation for what's happened and being honest about it shows them that there's a way to progress through it. Don't come right out and say it, but just provide a few URLs for online mental health services or groups like this one.

I wouldn't recommend sending them YouTube video links of others who have left the cult, most of these are produced by outlets they will immediately reject. In addition, you're sending them right back to YouTube where the algorithm is ready to deliver another ten videos reinforcing their delusions.

**Stick with it**

You need to stick to this (unless in the case of family emergencies etc). If they call or text you immediately do not engage with them. Don't answer the phone. Block them if you have to. If you do answer you will probably face another barrage of abuse and nonsense from someone speaking entirely from a place of anger.

Engaging with them in this way will serve no purpose and will likely undo everything you are attempting to do by sending the letter.

The letter is you making clear that the separation has started.

You probably should block or unfriend them on social media. They'll have a desire to lash out and be vindictive at least for a while. It would be better if you don't give them that opportunity and you absolutely must not respond no matter how much they might try to bait you into it.

Ultimately if they can't scream at you on Facebook or send you a hundred text messages they might resort to replying by letter. This is okay. They'll probably go through ten drafts starting with a screed of rage before resorting to something more rational. Depending on your loved one it might be possible to continue writing letters, but I think in most cases you'll find yourself throwing them away or just not wanting to open them.

Don't let them simply move the abusive relationship from Facebook to USPS. Hold your ground and if they start writing you letters filled with conspiracy theories and emotional blackmail stop opening them, write on the back 'contact me in 9 months' (or whatever time you initially set) and send them back unopened.

Your relative might make contact after only a week, or a month, and say they're done with Q. I don't mean to sound harsh but you probably shouldn't believe them. A lot of these vulnerable people will want both worlds and believe 'they can change' (seem familiar?)

The truth is that change takes work, will power and the use of available resources. They probably haven't truly attempted to move on at all and just want things to continue the way they were when you were unhappy and scared to be around them.

Stick to what you set out in the letter.

**In conclusion**

Writing letters takes time, it takes thought and effort. A fast paced argument by text or over the phone takes no time at all and allows for things to be said that are coming from a place of anger rather than genuine considered opinion or long-standing emotion.

It's harder to ignore a letter.

It's near impossible to resist opening and reading every word.

It might work. They might get in touch again when you've suggested it and be an entirely different person. A lot of former Q adherents are seeking therapy. Many have left the cult. The social network landscape is changing and it is making it harder for these factions to indoctrinate new people.

The pandemic will end and we will start getting back to our lives and filling our time with worthwhile things and it's likely that as that happens your relative will start to realize what they've done to their relationships.

Think about it, when life starts getting back to normal and they begin thinking about going out to dinner, hosting a party or going on vacation, they'll probably realize how many people they've lost.

Always be there for the loved one who gets out. It might not be tomorrow, it might not be in 9 months, it might take another 3 years, but be ready to welcome them back when they finally see the light.

510,My Qmother just disowned me,"I live in an area that is hit hard by the pandemic. Yesterday in a text, my Qmother asked me if I've had the vaccine. I told her that I haven't yet and I asked if she has. She tells me that she isn't going to get the vaccine because it ""messes with \[your\] genetic code"" and asked me to please not get it. This made me so angry because 1) during the summer she cried in a group text about how she's going to die if she gets covid; 2) she works in a nursing home; and 3) the misinformation she believes in is dangerous because it puts herself and others at risk. I also knew it wasn't worth debating with her anymore since she's not open to new information, she never listens to me anyway, and she's just going to gaslight me like she always does.  

 I told her:

&gt;Are you doing this for attention? Validation? You should know by now that I'm not going to validate your QAnon conspiracy theories. I take these issues very seriously, but there's no point in debating if you're totally committed to your beliefs despite all the evidence. I know you're aware the virus can be deadly, so I hope you would do what you can to keep yourself and others safe by getting vaccinated.

I had to set a boundary and I wanted to bring attention to the motivations for her behavior. She has a   
 history of exploiting me for emotional validation and I refuse to play that role for her. Predictably, I knew she would get mad. I just didn't expect her to literally disown me lol.

This is how she responded (all in text messages):

&gt;What the hell did you respond to my question like this for? Who do you think you are talking to??  
&gt;  
&gt;I am your mother, I can be concerned for you because I happen to love and care for you  
&gt;  
&gt;This reponse is bull shit! Ppl at my work are having reactions that are sending them to the hospital!  
&gt;  
&gt;Why do you think I asked you. So you can come at me with angry accusations?  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I'm a conspiracy theorist?  
&gt;  
&gt;You know, forget I'm your mother. That is what your color revolution socialist agenda does anyways. I feel sorry for you, you will be in for a terrible shock. And you know what I think, you'd turn your own family in to the Gestapo. Welcome to the ONE WORLD ORDER. I will pray for the redemption of your soul. Don't call me.

Now that I've gotten over the initial anger and hurt left by her comments, I just find them really funny in their absurdity. She even made an Instagram post that's passive-aggressively directed at me. It shows an image with text that says, ""I hate when people confuse education with intelligence. You can have a degree and still be an idiot"" (I have two degrees). The caption says ""Socialism or Communism is SATANISM. Get that straight! Elitist!"" (I'm a socialist.) In the comments she wrote, ""Don't get me started! I'm at an age where I don't give a shit what anyone thinks! You can go fuck yourself!"" I seem to have really struck a nerve lol.",QAnonCasualties

I hope you can respect this, thanks!” My mom responded with a thumbs up (she’s not Q but very Catholic conservative.. she doesn’t have much interest in following or discussing politics but will lean right if the topic comes up). Dad didn’t respond for a week. When he finally did it was a deluge of comments. Walls of text unprovoked. 

He said things like, “you’re not experienced or qualified enough to debate me on these things”, “you don’t even have a clue how you’re being manipulated by censorship”, “get out of my way, you are out of my league, all of you.. you’re too young”, “you obviously don’t need me around... you might want to get your head out of the way, you’re not as smart as you think”, and he said Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero. 

My sister, who is not a Q person and whom I am very close with, finally responded, basically saying that he proved my point and that we just want a normal relationship with our dad and would like to keep politics out of every conversation. Then he said, “We can all part ways. If the world gets it shit together, then we can reset, reevaluate and see what happens, if at all even possible. None of you don’t really know me. It appears it may stay that way.” 

Sooooo I guess he isn’t interested in having a relationship with us. I live 1,000 miles away from him and we don’t talk very often anyway so I just don’t understand his need to always discuss these things when we aren’t even together physically. Trying to grapple with it all. Pissed at the hurtful things he said to me and pissed at this evil cult for ruining his life. Surprised he cut us out first. He’s pushing us away. Not sure what to do.

Source: freejoy.aimoo.com  
What is the eternal God of creation, eternal the way Tao (in taoism)?  
What is the character of the savior Messiah Mahdi Maitreya Buddha, and how to find him/her?

I as the real savior Messiah Buddha will give you the correct answer, whether you can understand it or not is another question.

The big mistakes top secret controllers, secret societies are making is that they do not simply understand the eternal God.  
The   secret controllers here I mean those are the “Gods” and entities who   are really control the shadow government in many nations, as long as the   “referee” as well.

They  only  think the savior Messiah Buddha is a being with super power, super   abilities just like in the movie “Journey In The West”.  
They  are so  wrong because the savior Messiah Buddha is the one who fully  understand  the God of creation, the eternal Tao (in taoism).  
They do not believe a mortal human with no super power or super abilities is “above level” them.

The   eternal God of all creation has no image, no sound, is exist beyond  any  eye can see. (you can verify it in many sacred books)  
**It is a correct theory in mind.**

But   all those stupid secret controllers, societies are expecting a being   with super power, super abilities for them to see in real eyes, which   mean is not the real eternal God of creation.

If   you need an explanation of why you guys are still struggle with level   3, 4 or 5 in “cultivate divine neutral energy”), then the answer is not   lack of guide but the true is that you guys do not have the correct   theory about the eternal God in your mind.  
Some westerner people may not understand what I am talking about but the East will understand it.  
Those   groups are the one who secret helped small nations like China,  Vietnam,  North Korea win against the USA, France, Japan in physical  weapon  battle war.

The eternal   power of any beings is correct theory about the eternal God, but not   physical power, super abilities. The super power super abilities is just   like the clothes.

If you  need  any “super power” to “unlock” or to “hold” anything such as door,  gate,  swords, then all you need to do is make a fair amount of donation  to  me, then make a request in detail of how you going to use, the  timing,  etc. Then all you need to do is use smartphone, open the  conversation  with me  and show that to that “legendary weapon/gate”  before “make  your action”.

Or  if you have any  connection with super natural beings and want to verify  whether my real  eternal God power is stronger than you guys (who have  activated super  abilities power), you can use that similar method.

Stop saying everybody can talk, all are just theory.  
If   you want to “gambling” your own life, I willing to “play” with you  guys  under the observe of a super power being such as Lord Shiva.

The truth of life, the truth of creation is that simple but hard to understand.

I   share this information like a last warning for you guys to stop those   stupid actions, the time of much more super powerful beings re-enter  the  game of life is comming very soon (less than 100 days from now). If  any  of you (the secret controllers) vanished by unknown reason, then  you  guys can only blame yourself.

Feel free to send this article to top secret controllers, secret societies for them to wake up before too late.

515,February 22nd.,"Well, we are fast approaching February 22nd. The date that my Q (former) friend told me would be the day that she would come back and apologize to me if ""The Storm"" didn't happen by then...

I am well aware that a lot of Qcultists think that Trump will be Inaugurated on March 4th ect ect. I'm not sure why she threw out February 22nd as the date that mattered.

I do know that literally nothing will happen. On February 22nd or March 4th or any date inbetween. 

I don't know what the goal post will be moved to after that date, however I am sure that it will be moved. 

I also know that there is no way that she will seek me out and apologize for calling me a fool and a DemonRat and whatever else, due to me not beleiving in Q insanity ect 

And I know that i sure as hell wont seek her out to remind her of it either. She said this to me in writing, that February 22nd would be the magical day. I have a screenshot. That I will do nothing with. 

Its not worth it.

She used to be someone who was a left wing libertarian. Then she started to tip toe to the right. During Covid, she started to post some odd stuff. She would post about Epstein and this cabal of celebrities and politicians who traffick babies. She would talk about how we shouldn’t believe any media since it’s organized to lie to us. She posted stuff from Alex Jones and when my dad, someone who was also friends with her, pointed out that Alex Jones isn’t reliable information, she unfriended him. This one day she posted on instagram of her face painted with symbols, and the caption was talking about how she will help destroy the evil forces hurting children. She would talk about how she was awakened and everyone else was blind.
Recently she posted something about Mark Zuckerberg being a reptile. I pointed out that calling a Jewish person a reptile is extremely anti-semitic and is rooted in far right propaganda. She replied saying that her belief of a reptilian race that planted seeds for civilizations predates any organized religion, so she wouldn’t stop calling him a reptile. After I told her I hope she was just unaware of how harmful that was, she unfriended me.

Q: so I noticed the hooters over by X went out of business. And then I saw they're putting something new in there. Which is weird. 

Me: I mean restaurant spaces are generally taken over by new restaurants due to the equipment and layout and stuff. 

Q: then I noticed that a new comedy bar is opening up.

Me: that's actually really cool...

Q: but it's in the middle of a ""pandemic"" restaurants are going under with this shutdown. Who is investing in restaurants???

Me: well lots of people fund their own restaurants, plus there are lots of grants and loans out there right now...

Q: no no no, these people have some kind of knowledge. Stuff the rest of us don't know about. Some kind of plan we aren't in on.

Me: COMPLETELY changes the subject and quickly ends conversation

Knowledge? Like the knowledge that there's a fucking vaccine? Like the knowledge that shit is already opening back up again? Like the fact that restaurants constantly open, fail, and close. Or open and succeed? Or knowledge like the fact that Hooters has always been mediocre and when people door dash food it's not going to be fucking Hooters!?!

It’s rude.* 

My brothers both looked at me like, *thank you.*

I went so far as to have my first child without drugs, because that was what she wanted. After 24 hours and more stitches than anyone cared to count - all she said was, ""well, I guess I will never call you a hypochondric again."" At that point I gave up - and out relationship has been strained ever since.  

However, my relationship with my Dad has always been closer. We are just on the same wave length. We have always been able to talk about political things - even when we disagreed. We respected each other and always kept it on an intellectual level. As I moved more and more to the left - things remained the same. Until the last few months.

531,"QAnon is a Nazi Cult, Rebranded","I don't know if this will help some of you or not, but it's true. The concepts behind Qanon are not new. [Qanon really is a Nazi Cult rebranded](https://www.justsecurity.org/72339/qanon-is-a-nazi-cult-rebranded/).

I have lost several friends to Trumpism and to Q. All were normal average 'center/left or center/right' in their politics.

Over the last 3 years I've learned that there are really only two approaches. The first requires a huge amount of time and 'deprogramming' and can't really be done from a distance. It requires cutting them off from the constant flow of lies through (mostly) online media they consume, and cutting off the communities they join, especially facebook groups.

The other approach is difficult, but the only way for relationships that are less formal, like friendships. You have to cut them out of your life. Accept that there is no longer room in your life for them and move on. I know it sounds harsh, but it's the only thing I've found works for more loosely bound relationships, and often close ones, like family, as well.

Why can't you just shake them out of it and make them see how insane they sound and act?

The reason is that Q is not just recycling lies from a century ago that also took hold then (and still lingers), it also uses cult formation techniques that make it particularly attractive to the way humans process information. It's inclusive, and flexible, with a base set of beliefs so people have 'a truth' what they call The Plan, but also allows them to make it their own (i.e. making up a conspiracy theory like Democrats are manipulating the weather in texas) and it's a self reinforcing community amplified by social media groups (not unlike this one, but for evil).

I'd like to think I'm wrong on this, but after dealing with half a dozen relationships (family, friends and S.O.), I don't think there's any other ways to fix it.

My heart goes out to all of you suffering through what's, for many, horrible loss. I know the feeling well. It's not unlike having that person die in some ways and, sadly, I think we have to treat it that way.

Some of them may eventually come back, many will morph into some other extreme belief system (I suspect many will end up in edge-case evangelical churches over time), but they're effectively gone. I'm so sorry if reading this and believing it to be true (as I do) hurts. I wish I'd know this 3 years ago though, so, I’m putting it here for people to take or leave as they see fit.

Life gets better, and the hurt and pain of loss goes away with time. Time really does heal all wounds, even though it also usually leaves a scar too.",QAnonCasualties

Also will have mentions of homophobia and abortion.  I'm open to Advice but mostly venting

My family is full of very kind, but emotionally unintelligent people. They're not very good at communicating about feelings, especially not confrontation. You know the John Mulaney bit about how people keep their feelings in their belly and one day they'll die? That's my family. 

The older members, ie born before the 80s, are the most like this. Us younger ones are doing better but. Oof. Our older generation is not. You need that for context. More context you need is their relationship with Catholicism. We are Irish Catholics who came from Ireland, landed in Pittsburgh, and never left. Most of my family worked in the steel mills, when the air quality here was still something out of a Dickens novel. They went to churches where they were encouraged to fully and completely trusting of their priest, the Bible, and the Pope. If your priest tells you being gay is a sin, of course you believe it. These are churches that have graveyards ""for the unborn"". I remember being a child and being given a set of rosaries where the beads were little fetuses in wombs. Yeah. it was fucking weird. These are people who believe that heaven and hell are physical places. Babies who die before being baptised will go to hell. Transubstantiation is a real thing, not symbolic. 

That's most of the background. The most trouble we are having is with my great aunt, and one of her adult sons.Great aunt is, to be blunt, not the brightest. But she was not raised in a way that encouraged critical thinking skills, you can't blame her for that. Two years ago, she lost two of her sisters within 3 weeks of each other, very suddenly. It absolutely crushed her. And now because of Covid she is really suffering re social isolation. I don't know as much about her adult son, but they've both always been such fucking kind people. Clueless sometimes, but so kind. When I came out it was no big deal to them. They've shown compassion to my cousin who struggled with addiction. They're the kind of people you can call in the middle of the night when you're in trouble. 

But now they've gone fucking bananas. I feel like QAnon has taken these kind, vulnerable people, convinced them that there are children bring kidnapped by Democrats, and it just spiraled from there. When you believe that bread and wine PHYSICALLY TRANSFORMS into the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ, it's not that big of a logical leap to be convinced that Joe Biden tortures children for their hormonal energy or whatever the fuck. I can almost GUARANTEE that they don't understand the horrible racism, antisemitism, etc involved in QAnon. Don't get me wrong: they are participating in these things, and it's Wrong of them. They're adults who can make decisions, and they're choosing to be fucking awful. 

But if they were just shitty people, I could just write them off as shitty people. But it's not that simple. I've lost my loved ones to a cult that manipulated them. It makes me so angry, all the time. Sometimes I think about my Gran, and how horrified she would be by her sister's facebook posts, glorifying Trump as a savior and saying the election was fraudulent. 

I've very much taken a ""detach with love"" stance. If they ever want to leave that shit, I'll welcome them back. It's important for people in cults to know there is someone on the outside who loves them, otherwise they'll never leave. But it's been heavy on my mind lately, and I've been ranting to my boyfriend about it constantly. That's not fair to him, so here I am.

She’s a major Anti-vaxer, believes 5G is dangerous, believes in the great reset conspiracy, the Democrats pedophelia, the election being stolen, the coming civil unrest, and on and on! I’ve been married for 12 years and have struggled with her rabbit hole of conspiracies for almost 10 of those years. Trump being elected just accelerated the situation. She was down at the capital during the insurrection, armed with pepper spray and a knife. She claims she was there for an anti-vaccine rally but upon further research, it was a supporting rally for the insurrection with multiple members of her rally, playing a part in the insurrection.

543,We don’t want them.,"Conservative here.  I’m tired of being classified as part of the “Qpeople” because of my political affiliation.  

The Qult are not the majority, but because they are so “loud,” we are all being placed into one group.

I don’t claim these people.  They fall into the same category as KKK and Antifa.  Undesirables and domestic terrorist threats.  (They are also officially labeled as such.)

Conservatives have to find a place to come together and distance ourselves from the Qult.  They are a disease and the infection is spreading.  This is an area maybe even the left and right could find common ground on and work together?

Christians using scripture to back up these lies are either deceived or are only professed Christians.  Pastors and priests also have to unite in denouncing the Q movement.  It is not Godly, nor does it mirror any of Christ’s teachings. 

“Q” posts were first on the website called 4chan.  This site is also known for child pornography.  Qpeople are against child trafficking, yet they follow a man whose beginnings originated in a place conducive to child abuse.  

Lin Wood is playing them as fiddles.  This man actually claimed to be Christ as the second coming.  Legal briefs are filed with the Court that go into more disturbing details of things he’s said.  You can also find pages 9 and 10 of the Georgia Bar grievance to be equally disturbing.  He holds daily pity parties via Telegram and then regularly sends his “Army” of “digital soldiers” after people, including his own son.  He also published physical addresses of the people seeking to disbar him.  It appears to be a way to distract the Qultists so that they don’t rise up against him for all of his past lies, particularly about Trump remaining in office.  If he is disbarred, I fear this will only fuel the Qultists, as he indoctrinates them daily about it being politically motivated and ultimately tied to child sex traffickers.  He is laying the foundation to be a martyr.  

Simon Parkes believes his mother is an alien and that he also fathered a hybrid alien child himself.  This man is occult.  

Christians should know better.  These are not Godly leaders.  It makes me wonder if this is part of the strong delusion that God says he will send, where even the elect will be deceived.

If sharing your experiences would be cathartic for you and help others understand what your situation is like, please reach out via DMs. I'm envisioning a 10-20 minute opportunity to chat with the 15 students to describe your situation and to answer questions they might have.

546,Our Method of Dealing,"This won't work for the more rabid Qooks out there, but my father is extremely, angrily conservative, and I'm becoming more liberal every year. We also like to travel together, and as we're both single older men, it's truly a pleasure to have the company. Several years ago, as the nation's passions were rising, we took a trip to Romania. Our promise, agreed to explicitly on both sides, was that we would not even mention politics, or anything - *anything* \- about politics. That worked, and we've since travelled alone together, and in groups, without any bad feelings or misunderstanding. That just reinforced my belief that many Q adherents are simply so disconnected from the objects of their contempt that they no longer realize they're just human beings, like all of us. My dad is a kind, caring person, in the most local, immediate, in-person sense. He wouldn't harm a single person - as long as he recognizes them as a person. Once Rush Limbaugh and his type called them ""degenerate pieces of crap"", well, that's entirely different. I suspect that's true for a lot of people.",QAnonCasualties
547,The QAnon year,"Just joined after reading about this subreddit on NYT.  I'm M/late 40s; my GF is in mid 40s.  We met a little over a year ago &amp; hit off a great relationship.  Little did I realize what I was headed into.

She:  Lets watch Fox TV.

Me:  Sure.

She:  Covid is a conspiracy.  Virus was built in a lab.  China is bad.  Masks are killing people.  Soros is evil.  So are Clinton, Biden.  Gates is trying to convert people to bots.  Vaccine will alter DNA.  BLM, Antifa, Radical Left are destroying this country.  Democrats &amp; celebs are pedos.  CNN, NYT, ABC, CBS.....are bs.  You like NFL?  I love Dana P. and Greg G.  Lame Stream Media is all bs.

Me:  Hmmm.  Lamestream?  That was Palin, no?

She:  Facebook is bad.

Me:  Yes!!  {There is hope}

She:  Trump is so Christian.  Look he has Bible in his hand - 'this sends shivers down my spine'.  Isn't this amazing - he's going to save us and humanity.

Me:  Who?  Donald?!

She:  Lets buy food, guns, ammo, candles, batteries, water, gold coins.  Lets bury the food in 2' deep soil outside.

Me:  Who's digging?

She:   I love my country.  I'm a patriot.  All traitors will be executed (sic).

Me:  Are we still in 21st century USA?  Who uses 'Traitor' and 'Executed' in serious conversation?

\----elections, inauguration etc-----

She:  Elections are stolen.  Fox is also bad.  Dana P has turned.  Mitch M. is also a traitor.  All traitors are revealing themselves.  Lets watch Newsmax &amp; OAN.

Me:  Is it legal to charge $5 for utter crap?

She:  Rudy, Sidney, Li are gods!  They'll find a way.

Me:  Did he just fart?

She:  There will be blackouts.  There won't be any inauguration.  Trump gets second term.  Army is going to arrest everyone.

Me:  I'm working remote.

She:  {crying - tears streaming down her face}   There's no God!  (sic)  Why else would Biden be President?!

Me:  {consoling}  It'll be alright.  {secretly hoping this is the end of this phase}

\---Ten days later---

She:  Did you know that USA is a corporation?

Me:  What?!

She:  Yep.  Trump will be inaugurated in March.  USA and Taiwan are sending forces to get rid of Communist Party of China.  Xi is really a friend.  Trump put Flynn and his brother in charge before he left.  They will save us.

Me:  You effin Whacko!  Get the eff out!!  I have work to do!

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so it didn't end just like that.  But its been an incredible amount of tears, drama and foolishness.  Just really tired - and in shock -  that the last year of my life ended like this.  I really love her - and I have tried to salvage the situation an innumerable number of times.  But really, I couldn't even get a word in when she would lay out her arguments.

Her last email says "".....(family)  heritage whom set the tone not follow like a sheep.""  And yes, the implied reference to sheep is Me.  She still thinks that she has discovered the truth.

Here's the kicker - Even though she's been in USA for over twenty years, she's French &amp; not even an American citizen.

My dad died suddenly when we were kids, and my mom is an alcoholic/abusive and doesn’t help the situation and often makes it far worse. She’s become irritable, short tempered, and physical at times. I’ve tried so many things, (talking to her psychiatrist, trying to help her with schoolwork, talking to her school, trying to explain government and institutional structures in a logical way) and it hasn’t helped. She recently failed out of school (freshman) and I just don’t know what to do. I’ve talked to my own psychiatrist about it, and she said she may need a specialized form of therapy, similar to what former cult members sometimes undergo. I love her so much, I just want my sister back. If there’s interest, I can follow up on many of the things she’s said/done in allegiance to Q.",QAnonCasualties

551,I just didn't know how common this was,"It started with the constant drone of Fox News in my (34M) parents house anytime my wife and I were over. As time went on, my father slipped more and more into his iPad. It became nothing but a Facebook machine, the holding place for the echo chamber. Content systematically delivered to find into the fringe things he started digging into.

He's from a generation where the news was more trusted. Where not everything was a blatant opinion piece, doling out strictly partisan politics and us versus them ideologies.

As the 2016 election went on, he already was a pro Trump guy because... Well, his reasons were copy pasted from news sources. Crooked Hillary. Benghazi. She's a career politician and he's a billionaire business man.

Then he started pandering Sandy Hook conspiracies and I thought this guy is really going over the edge.

I remember the day he casually said, ""One of the pages I follow on Facebook, this Q Anon person said....""

And I'm in my 30s, grew up on the internet and yeah even 4chan. I knew what it was. God, wasn't it obvious trolling and incitement? Wasn't it so clearly just bullshit?

I don't support either party. Nothing but crooks, too much money in politics. Class division is the true unfought fight in our world.

I tried to temper him, reading him Trump quotes out of context and watching his brain short circuit when I said, ""That was Trump who said windmills cause cancer."" He would huff off, knowing the jig was up but too much at battle with cognitive dissonance.

It got to the point where all he did was respond with Q talking points and corporate for-profit news bullshit. I could predict what he would say, because it was all that predictable and just utterly programmed.

I tried to tell him this and he told me I was brainwashed. Just like when I said I wasn't for Trump, he put it on me that I must have been for Hillary. He couldn't compute that I don't support any of this type of garbage. I watched him fall apart from a good man with a sharp mind into just another parroting qultist.

He started treating my wife poorly, despite her having no such interactions. She was guilty by association. In July 2019, my wife asked him to walk her down the aisle at our wedding, because her parents are not with us. We mutually cried and he accepted.

In August, he lost it. Told me I was brainwashed. Started treating her like shit. I told him we were done and that he would have to come before me like Christ himself to apologize to my wife for ruining our family and our wedding.

Nothing. We were pregnant at that time, and he didn't know. I shared the news months later. Nothing.

Our daughter turns 1 year old this weekend. I have not seen or heard from him since August of 2019. My parents, both alive and well, were not there for the birth of my daughter. They won't be there for her first birthday. They're nearing 70 and both smokers, so I don't know if I will ever see them again.

Maybe like others, I was foolishly hopeful that the election cycle would shake a lot of this off. But the truth is, we've been calling them cultists and the election cycle doesn't effect that. I have no doubt he would have traveled to DC on Jan 6 if he was physically able. I have no doubt he thinks Trump will just reappear in the Oval Office in March like these people are saying now.

I often say that the people in our lives will show us who we want to be.... And others will show us who we must not become. My only solace is the standards I have as a father and husband are informed by this.

Just another story, same as so many. Thanks for providing a place I could write it down.

I am here to support anyone going through this.",QAnonCasualties
552,I may have made some progress,"My boyfriend is deep into the QAnon koolaid. He started down the path via David Icke combined with his incredibly conservative upbringing. 

We have fought over politics (and reality itself) for nearly a year. He talked about how ‘the left’ and ‘liberals’ are ruled by their emotions. But I walk on eggshells never knowing what topic I might want to talk about that he somehow connects to all the conspiracies and would get triggered and start ranting. When he starts that, hearing himself say the things he believes gives him a hit of dopamine. He spins himself up on the drug, getting louder and more angry the longer he speaks. He can’t hear anything around him. When I try to get a word in, he doesn’t let me finish a sentence. He makes an assumption about where my sentence is going and that it disagrees with him, and to prevent the cognitive dissonance and discomfort of hearing something that conflicts with his views, he interrupts and starts on a rant again.

The progress I made last night had absolutely nothing to do with addressing the conspiracies. I talked to him about how we communicate, and his habits around talking with me. I told him how he behaves and what he does. 

And he doesn’t do it to just me, he does it to his best friend too. I talked to him about how he projects what he thinks I think onto me, without actually listening to what I have to say. I talked about how he spins himself up and seems high and crazed from this essentially drug. I talked about how I walk on eggshells because he gets triggered by topics I thought weren’t political at all. I talked about how there is no space in the relationship for me- only his ideas, his beliefs and his ego. None of this had anything to do with QAnon or the beliefs themselves. 

He admitted that he does project onto me and assume what I believe for me. He admitted to being too much of a zealot.

She follow the rules in her own way, sometimes not putting a mask to receive people out (they don't enter our house but dad and I are very strict with groceries/people that come from any part of our country). Yet she thinks her life doesn't matter.

It hurts because she can't see that. I hope I can get her out of that place, honestly...

556,"I recently stood up against a conspiracy theorist in front of his daughters. While I did so with a clear conscience and positive intent, I can’t help but feel guilty and feeling perhaps I could have handled it differently. Some of my friends think I should just let him be.","My friends and I have a gaming group chat on WhatsApp. There are 15 of us in the group, some of whom I’m very close to, while others are close friends of friends whom I’ve gotten to become friendly with. The group also includes two teenage daughters of a friend. For illustration purposes here, I’m going to call him Jake. All 15 of us are natives of Southeast Asia and live here. 

Recently, I’ve realised that Jake has become more vocal with conspiracy theories. I’ve met him for drinks a couple of times with the intention of catching up. These catch up sessions however, I’ve realised, tend to pivot progressively to something a bit more “evangelical”, where almost always, at some point, I get “preached” to about about some sort of conspiracy theory. I tend to ignore them unless they are COVID related. Even then, I ignored them at first as just a quirk of Jake’s. Then, I started getting private texts. It was at first from Jake, then another friend, and another. All of which supported some sort of ridiculous theory about COVID. 

I’d like to think that I’m quite educated, am well-read, and because I am a bit of a stickler for facts, tend to cross-check the information I receive across multiple credible sources or news sites. However, as conversations with Jake progressed, he started making me feel as though I was arrogant or not as well read as I thought I was. He also started sharing conspiracy theories about COVID being a scam on our gaming group chat more frequently. 

That was when I drew the line and started replying to provide different perspectives that contradicts his COVID-related conspiracy theories on the group chat. 

I did so because I understand how dangerous conspiracy theories can be, and how easily one can get rabbit-holed. It has serious real world consequences, especially in uncertain times like these. So, personally, I’ve made a socially conscious decision to speak up whenever someone spreads conspiracy theories, especially when it relates to COVID, instead of enabling them further or allowing that behaviour to be normalised. 

Some of my friends who like me, don’t buy in to these conspiracy theories think that I should “let Jake be Jake”. That I should be more tolerant. 

I disagreed. 

I did what I did because it was driven by three intentions:

1. I was not looking to change Jake’s views. I’ve had numerous interactions with him and have tried different types of approaches to change his beliefs. Unfortunately, I honestly think that he has gone too far down the rabbit hole. I’ve accepted that it is highly unlikely that I would be able to convince him to change his belief. The only reason I responded to him was because he was sharing disinformation about COVID being a scam. I posted what I did because there are two teenagers in that group chat. His daughters. 

2. My “target”, although it may seem like so, isn’t Jake. It was his audience. In this case, his two daughters, his best friend and the rest of the members in the group. I felt that his daughters and best friend may find themselves to be more invested in changing his perspective than I do. For me, selfishly, I am more invested in preventing others being drawn in to conspiracy theories than I am in the person spreading it. I had shared an article from Healthline on the psychology of conspiracy theorists in response to a couple of videos Jake had posted which perpetuated a view by one Dr. Simone Gold which drove disinformation about COVID. He had manipulated the fact that she was doctor to justify it as truth. This act of mine however, I feel, did kill the group chat’s vibe. Jake has also gone silent on the group chat. 

3. However, if my action discourages or silences one person from sharing a blatant lie or false theories that has no scientific basis whatsoever, then maybe, that’s one less act of disinformation that is contributing to potential real world, life and death consequences. It’s a bonus outcome I would welcome with a clear conscience. I can’t help but hope that there are many more out there who share my intentions and do the same when it comes to conspiracy theorists. The same way most people would speak up against racism, sexism or violence. Because to me, disinformation about COVID, is far more dangerous than those three combined, especially in the middle of a pandemic that has killed millions.",QAnonCasualties

Anyone absorb any podcasts, articles, twitter threads, videos that made you feel a little more knowledgeable on the subject? or maybe less alone? This subreddit has been helpful in and of itself.

I'm you know, the daughter of two people I love so much and have always been extremely close with. I had pretty much called my Mom every single day since I left home for years, up until last year. I don't even want to talk to her anymore. The anti-vax emails, the foaming-at-the-mouth love for Donald Trump, the extremely shady ""memes"" she was sharing on Facebook and Instagram became all so incredibly hard to watch. So many of her own close friends cut her off cold turkey without explanation, won't return her calls, blocked her online, and she ""doesn't know why"". I know why. 

I am an extremely non-confrontational person. I've never broached the subject head on with either of my parents. When they start going down the Q-hole with me in conversation, I tend to find an excuse to get off the phone. I blocked them both on Facebook for my own sanity a few months ago and vaguely told them ""Oh I deleted it"". I can't tell if my ""pretend-i-do-not-see"" approach is good or just evasive and hurting them further. But, they are very smart people who have just filled their brains with garbage who I think, even if I took them head on, would think I ""don't see the truth"" and am not as ""well researched"" as they are.

559,QAnon watchers,"&amp;#x200B;

That is how I would describe my husband of 35 years.  He does not follow all of the QAnon conspiracies.  He does not believe the pedophiles who eat children.  But he does agree with most of their deep state crap.  He believes the election was stolen.  He does not condemn the Capital riots, he believes the virus is overblown, he believes Trump is all but the second coming.  He  had such a fit yesterday about gas prices that his yelling scared both of our dogs into trembling.  He would rather have me avoid him at all costs, for me to spend evenings in tears over his anger at all of the ”lying left” than to admit his alternative facts do not stand up to reality.

 The part that makes me the most angry is that he does not come out as QAnon, but leans so far right these days that there is very little daylight.  We have always seen politics different.  I am a lifelong Democrat.  He was liberal when we married.  I started losing him to the far right 20 years ago.  That’s when he started listening to Rush Limbaugh on his truck radio all the time.  Now trying to talk to him is like talking to Rush or Hannity or any other Fox idiots.  To me, Q is an evil poltergeist, made up of all of theses ranting, angry morons.  They spew hate and rage and stoke fear.  Words have power! They are ruining families everyday with the hate and bigotry they vomit out.    


I wonder if I can sue Fox if all of this costs me my marriage.  Probably not.  Fox and QAnon walk hand in hand.  They will lead your loved ones down a dark path you may not be able to follow.  I don’t know how to stop the damage or reverse the process.",QAnonCasualties
560,My Uncle (Just me venting),"Hi everyone! My name's Jill, I just found out about this subreddit today from an article on Politico and wanted to post/vent about my uncle, who is falling progressively deeper into the whole QAnon hole.

As background, my uncle used to be a pretty moderate guy politically. He may not have been a genius, but I never thought he was dumb, gullible, or anything like that. Things really started to change though during the Great Recession. Like a lot of people he lost his job. Around the same time, his marriage fell apart and, ultimately, he had to declare bankruptcy. He started blaming then President Obama for his problems and the fact he was not getting back on his feet as fast as he felt that he should. After talking with my mom and other members of our family, he moved to Florida, where most of them lived, both to have more of a social support system and in hopes of having more opportunity for a job than in the shrinking midwestern city he had lived in. Although he kept drifting rightward politically, there still wasn't much of a sign that he was falling in with QAnon until the last few months.

Predictably given the scenario above, he was a HUGE Trump supporter. Everything he and his prominent supporters said was the gospel truth regardless of facts to the contrary. When more mainstream news sites started not giving him the take on things he wanted, my uncle started drifting to more extreme sites peddling conspiracy theories, edited videos, and the like. Suddenly, everyone to the left of Trump was a dangerous Marxist and a member of Antifa (including my wife, my mom, and I, all of whom did not buy into Trumpism or these conspiracies) out to destroy his country.

So, its important to point out three things here about myself and my life. 1) Although I identify as a trans woman now, I did not at the point in time at that this next part takes place and am still not out to my family yet, 2) my wife identifies as a member of a religious minority in America and my uncle knows this, and 3) I have a doctorate in an area of public policy. Things started taking a hard turn and our relationship strained when he decided to post some things on social media defending white supremacist groups who had actively called for harm against Jewish people, Muslims, and people of color in our country, often implicitly but often explicitly. I pointed out to him just how much this hurt considering his nephew, who he supposedly cared about and was definitely a part of his family, was married to someone who was being targeted by these groups. I told him I was appalled that he could possibly defend and agree with people who, given the chance, would kill my wife and any children we hoped to have. His only response was that he was looking out for his family and that I needed to do more research like he did if I actually thought the mainstream media was telling me the truth about these groups (proceeding to link me to an opinion post on Scott Adam's blog).

That was kind of the start of his slide. From there, his social media became full of reposts and retweets of articles supporting QAnon causes or from actively Q affiliated accounts. He started asking for Q's take on other articles he found, seemingly in all seriousness. Although I can't necessarily prove it since my uncle is really the only member of my extended family who is active on social media, but I think he pulled in more of them with him. Not that we would have gone given the pandemic, but my mom, wife, and I were noticeably the only members of my family not invited to Thanksgiving. He also went no contact with my mom for a long time, believing her to be a traitor for voting for Biden. I've similarly gone no contact with him after he posted a slew of QAnon related articles following the attempted coup in January, trying to belittle what happened, blame it on left wing agitators or the deep state, and the like.

All that said, its just sad that all of this has happened, I see no way to pull him out of it, or signs that he will come back to reality. I'm glad that my wife has a strong connection with her family and that my mom and dad do not subscribe to this cult, but I wish my future kids would be able to connect with some family on my side of things. I'm an only child and, barring things changing unexpectedly, I don't think I'd feel comfortable letting any of my extended family near any of my future children. Especially once I'm out, I know I'd likely be excommunicated from that part of the family anyway since transphobia runs deep there as well, but still, it'd be nice to at least have someone I'm related to who isn't a part of this cult.",QAnonCasualties
561,Need to talk to my parents and I have no idea how to do it.,"I need to call my parents tonight. I haven't had a conversation with them since before 1/6 and I've put off talking to them about as long as I could. But I've been too afraid to talk to them; afraid of what they might say or might believe.

I don't know how far down the hole they've gone. Dad's mentioned bread crumbs before. They were feverish supporters of 45. They believed the election was stolen. But they know my politics and never seemed to let that get in the way. I'm pretty sure they know I don't eat babies or whatever. But they're getting older, and I'm getting older - and all the things that come with that fact. And I can't keep avoiding them.

Just the knowledge that basically 30% of Americans believed the storming of the capital was justified, has me petrified at what my parents might believe. But I have no idea what to say. ""Do you believe this Q stuff? Do you believe the sedition was justified?"" ""Antifa inciters  &gt; BLM &gt; Hillary (queue Michael Bay explosions).""

562,Check in on Q Dad,"Hi 

I posted on here around the inauguration and I am just back to say that since then I have had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and I am ok. No bad side effects except tiredness and sore body. 

My Dad has emailed me various Q-based things insisting that the Vaccine will make me sterile, that I don't need it because I am young and healthy, etc.  He continues the same exact rhetoric, using the same language. There is nothing individual or even remotely reminiscent of his Old Self. My sister is currently living with him (she's young twenties) and that seems to be helping him calm the Q stuff down but she will be moving out at the end of the month. I wonder how things will go for him as the year continues. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would not say I am worried for him but I am sad. I wish my Mom wasn't dead. I wish he'd stop seeing his awful ex-wife. I wish he'd just Live and be present. Back during the Holidays when we thought we might be able to swing a family get-together he was politely disinvited due to his Trump-supporting. It's my Mom's family, so he claims to not care but they've been his family too for over twenty years. He got really angry and lashed out about it so I don't think he is welcome anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I just feel fatigued. I don't think I will ever be able to de-program him or make him see how bullshit it all is. I'll just have to wait and see how it shakes out.

563,glad to be here,"I've just joined this group. I am really glad to be here and read some of your posts. This past year has been really searing as I have realized how deeply my family has rejected me. The major evidence of their slide into Qanon was one email my mother sent me last summer to try to initiate a conversation with me. She included the email history, so I could see that it had circulated among my father, an uncle and some church members. I responded to her that I don't think it's worth our time to talk about anonymous posts made on dodgy websites. That is a fairly typical response for me, because I teach at the college level and tend to be direct with people who are off the wall in their thinking. I did some searching and found out that the website is actually a popular Qanon site, but only after I had sent my response to my mother. She never responded, so she basically went underground with her thoughts.

My mom and me are the outspoken liberals in our family, and all around black sheep.  Always have been.  My family dynamics were FUBAR long before Trump and Q.  But the rage and anger my middle aged brother seems to feel these days is terrifying.  And he purposely picks fights with our liberal, 78 year old mom.  Even to go as far as physically threatening her once, when she dared to criticize his ‘boss and commander in chief’.  Let’s just say we keep great distance between us and him.  It’s healthier.  Out of the blue, he calls my mom this morning and baits her with politics, this time about Texas.  She wasn’t overly sympathetic and this triggered him into screaming at her about how hateful she was and she wants to kill people and she’s an awful human.  He then hung up on her.  It’s like he called to just bait her into a known opinion so that he could unleash all his anger against liberals and women.  She was crying and super upset and I am just SO ANGRY.    Fuck these people.  They are terrifying.

566,I've been writing about the anti-vax chiropractor. My brother just called furious that my father and several other family members are spreading this stuff. When he engages he says they are just condescending and rude. It's starting to get to him as well. Kept him awake last night.," I hope people find this story I'm telling interesting. I hope I'm just not hijacking this sub with updates to this story every day.

Anyway, I've already spoken with a really well know science journalist about this and have a call with the LA Times this afternoon.

I'm calling the chiropractor boards after I'm done with this.",QAnonCasualties
567,Sharing child custody with QAnon adherents,"I am a parent who shares a child with QAnon believers. This has been going on for several years. 

My partner and I have always been very careful not to disparage the beliefs of our child's other parents; instead we say, ""Well, that is one way of looking at it. Here are some factors that we consider when choosing what to believe, but you get to choose what to believe in."" We also talk about credible sources and we've done the Checkology news literacy course together (check it out! it's really good). 

Our child is in therapy because of all this. She really struggled with the fact that both sets of parents did not believe the same things; her therapist said that it was hard for a child's identity formation to have to change their belief system each week when they transitioned to the other house. 

In the past several months, though, she has turned a corner and is skeptical of what her QAnon parents believe in because she has been able to identify their hypocrisy, their inability to listen to her and her feelings, and how bizarre their beliefs are in comparison to literally everyone else in her life. 

She doesn't like being at their house. She'd rather live with us. But she doesn't want to say this to them because she crumples whenever they are upset with her. She can't withstand their anger enough to be able to say what she wants. We haven't initiated any custody proceedings because it would cause so much emotional distress for her to be in conflict with the other set of parents, and we think they'd pressure her into saying that she wants to live with them. 

However, we're waiting until she gets old enough to be able to tolerate the discomfort of being in conflict with them. Still, the custody laws in our state are such that unless they are physically abusing her, it's hard to get full custody.

Is anyone else going through this? I just don't know anyone who's dealt with this. We feel very alone when it comes to this issue. When we talk about it to other people, they are in shock and disbelief about our story, which isn't really helpful. Or they say we should just get custody, and they don't understand that it is not likely we'd ever get full custody and they don't understand the harm it would do to our child to go through a pointless custody battle. 

In the meantime, we just focus on modeling healthy relationships, emotional boundaries, and accountability for our child. We talk with her about her feelings, help her process what's going on, and encourage her to call us if anything scary ever happens. But it's really hard to see her have to go through this.",QAnonCasualties
568,Too many people in my life have fallen into this cult,"Hi friends, I'm not new to Reddit, but this is a burner account. Since the summer, so many people in my life have fallen into this hole, and I don't know why. It might be due to the Coronavirus, I don't know, but it's had such a mental toll on me and the rest of my family. For example, my aunt unfortunately was seduced by this cult, and has attacked anyone in my family who's a Democrat, Independent, or an anti-Trump Republican, like my grandparents and my parents. Honestly, I just don't know what to do at this point, and she may have gone to the Capitol during the siege because I know a local company was renting buses and taking people down there to riot.",QAnonCasualties

570,First time posting but the curiousity is killing me!,"Hi,
So my family has just been ridiculous obviously that's why I'm here. They have spent a year fighting me about following guidelines instead of using any of that time to spend with their first grand kid. She's 16 months, I have a cancer history obviously better safe than sorry. They have lied and tried to endangered us multiple times because they wanted to go eat in a restaurant; or see a large group of friends instead of whatever we had planned.  Whatever. I really don't care what they do, just don't put us in harm's way. Ya know?

I am part of the deep state apparently because I never liked trump. My life has been turned upside down and it is hard to believe this actually is happening.",QAnonCasualties
574,"Guess it's my turn now, lost my own mother.","So my mother has always been a believer in a lot of quirky stuff. Growing up she was all into Nostradamus etc... In 2000, she bought pallets of water etc...

Now 20  years later, she is ""engaged"" to a ex army vet as she divorced my dad 14 years ago. I don't blame her for that, my dad has a lot of issues of his own. However, he is VERY anti liberal, yet face to face he is a very nice guy. However, he has no balls as he lets his own kids run all over him etc...

Anyway, I don't want to make this longer that it needs to be. Early 2020, my mom didn't even like Trump. However, by the time the election came up she went full hardcore Trump. We had some discussions throughout 2020 and I watched the conversion. I tried to fight some of it, but it went nowhere. She never really called me unless she needed something, usually technical, though the latest ones were more about how she could hide her money so she can stay on Medicaid 🙄. The hypocrisy knows no bounds.

She is 60 years old and she is on Medicaid, yet I don't think she should even be eligible. She had a ""cough"" and they gave her disability? Yet she rants all the time about ""blacks"" who are too lazy to hold a job and take advantage of the government. How does she not see the hypocrisy? It is 100% what she is!

Anyways, every single call with her ended up being converted to political. She said I never called her, which is bullshit, she just never answered. Yesterday was the final straw. She went into how the election was stolen again and I just hung up on her. I texted her afterwards with this.... and I probably went overboard, but I give up. I dread even talking to her now. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I'm done, don't call me anymore. I said before to stop this bullshit. Go join with your QANON cult and eat up their bullshit. The reason gas is going up is because of OPEC cuts  + increased demand as the pandemic is having less and less impact on decreased driving and also refinery shutdowns in TX. Not a pipeline that was never even built. But keep blaming what the boogeyman fox tells you to. You are so gullible you'll believe anything fox tells you. The fact you STILL think the election was stolen when everyone else admits it wasn't except trump and a few fox talking bobble heads is so stupid. TRUMP LOST DEAL WITH IT!   
&gt;  
&gt; You bitch how people are ""taking"" money, yet your trying to hide your money so you can live off the government on Medicare. You've only been a waitress all your life, hiding your tips so you don't pay much in taxes, then bitch how little you get? NO SHIT! How do you have anymore right to that than someone else? You have less of a right to that money as you paid in tons less. You bitch how people should be working, SO SHOULD YOU!

&gt;You are the biggest hypocrite I've ever known. Goodbye.",QAnonCasualties
575,"I'm hurt, confused, but I think mostly angry...","I need to share with someone that's objective, I found this reddit forum and I thought it would be good.  I just need to vent a little.  My mother has been deep into conspiracy theories for as long as I remember.  I think the only one she didn't buy at face value was Bush doing 9/11 and I only think that's only because she voted for him.  But she used to talk about how evil public school teachers were and that they only wanted to make kids atheists.  All kinds of crazy crap.  I grew up knowing what Christian Nationalism was, I used to know the pledge to the Christian flag.  I tell my wife this stuff and she looks at me like I've got three heads.  

When I was younger my brother and I were pitted against each other for my mother's affection.  She used to treat my brother so horribly, she beat him with a belt one time so badly that he fell and hit his head in a tub, we used to tell that story for laughs, its not funny anymore, and now I realize it never was.

Sorry, to the Q stuff, recently my parents have taken a deep dive into Qanon.  Now that I no longer believe like they do I'm the enemy now.  My brother and I are a united front for the first time in our lives and that seems to be making their ire worse.  I've tried to talk to them but it always ends up the same way yelling and crying.  My mother will start by yelling and then go straight into crying once that doesn't work (this is an old tactic and one I'm used to, it no longer phases me).

My dad's a little more receptive but every stride gets pulled back because of my mother.  My dad has always been a keep the peace kinda guy.  He'll go along with whatever my mother says.  I don't mean that to degrade him but it's true.  My father and I used to be really close.  I'd talk to him almost daily.  Now I avoid talking to him at all.  I was gonna name my first son after him, but I can't bring myself to do that anymore.

The last time I attempted to talk to them about this stuff my mother disowned me and said she never wanted to talk to me again.  She texted me this, there was clear record.  She tried to call me a week later like nothing had happened.  I told her ""I thought you never wanted to speak to me again."" She started screaming saying she never said that and that I was lying.  I read her texts back to her and she just said she didn't remember doing that.  I told her I had no interest in talking with her until she apologized.  She responded with ""fine, I'm sorry."". I told her she had to mean it.  Not just say it.  She responded with ""I didn't do anything wrong.""

I think my mother being gone into this Q stuff doesn't bother me as much as my Dad.  I miss my dad and just want him back, but my wife and I are going to start having a family soon and I can't have this insanity around my kids.


There's so much more I could say, but I'll cut it off.
I don't know what to do... Has anyone else dealt with this?

P.S. sorry about the length.",QAnonCasualties
576,Qanon,"Look. I know this will be controversial in today’s day and age but everyone I know was a Q believer. This is the QUICKEST way to get them out of it. It worked on 2 of my friends and 3 of my family members. I didn’t care enough about the the rest of the people to even try it. 

Get your facts together. Debunk as many Qanon conspiracies/lie as you can. Print it out. Put together a nice package that a 3rd grader can understand. Use multiple sources. This is a bit time consuming but very important. 

Then you need to take those Qanon believes head on. In my case they were all male. I told them they were believing in nonsense, and that they were anti American and to get the fuck out of my country with that fake news bullshit.

This will piss them off. Here comes the controversial part..........challenge them to a fight. Yes. Fist fight them. Doesn’t matter if you win or lose, but get some nice punches in. Once the fight is over and cooler heads prevail, they will see their actions are detrimental to your relationship. And cooler heads will prevails. Then start going over the fact booklet you made. And explain why it’s dangerous and ridiculous that they believe this shit. This will work. I guarantee it. Nothing creates friends like a good old fashioned fist fight.",QAnonCasualties

The     solutions, ideas in this article belong to me the savior messiah     buddha, you need my special permission to use it in the public/media.

There is no entity above religions.  
Religion is the best weapon to defeat the “evil”, the “stupid” beings/entities.

The next revolution of this civilization will kick off with religion.  
People     in certain nation will not just only allow to choose the religion   they   want to follow, but in near future they will be allowed to choose   the   city/town/state/nation with purify only 100% followers of each   religion   to live it.

I can see some big land immigration nation such as United States, Canada, Australia will allow that happen.

There are many various religions out there, but there are 6 major influenced religion must be in the list is:  
\- Christianity  
\- Islam  
\- Judaism  
\- Hinduism  
\- Buddhism  
\- Nonreligious/Atheist

Imagine     if one new political promise allow people to live in 100% pure     followers of each religion, it would bring automatic win in any nation     for sure !

So instead of 1 choice, now you will have 2 choices.  
Instead     of “gambling” in 1 religion in 1 society, now you can have your own     real life experiment in 100% purify religion society.

This     weapon is so big that if the West especially the USA using it  against    the East, they would win automatically. No any demi-gods,  angels or  any   entities in the game can counter it.

I do believe this is the only working solution for the USA and the West come out of the darkness.

584,Would you cut it off now,"My boyfriend is a long time conspiracy theorist. He’s smart, but seems to be missing some critical thinking skills when QAnon comes to play. 

He is this wonderful, sweet, kind and patient person. But, the idea of dealing with a lifetime of his crazy conspiracy theories gives me intense anxiety. We mostly avoid politics. His regurgitation of whatever he’s watching is frightening. And I wonder how good of a person can you actually be to eat this up?

My dad left, cut ties and moved abroad. I'm 23 my sister is 20, left the house and fending for ourselves. She used to be an amazing mom, I remember those times. I used to tell her everything she was like my best friend. I miss her. 

She goes on and on about these absolutely insane theories every time I'm on the phone with her like people being executed, Trump actually still being the president of the US and Biden is going to go to Guantanamo ( we're not even American, we're fucking French, to be fair she says the same about Macron, that he's a clone and the real one got jailed or whatever...). I'm on the verge of cutting ties but I'm scared this would make her go deeper into this insanity. Every time I speak to her I feel like my mind is about to split in half from the BS. 

We get ZERO support or help from our mother because all she cares about or talks about now is this conspiracy stuff. What she put us through is unbelievable.

591,A $9000 bet...,"So I work in a barbershop where politics is often discussed. Something was mentioned about Trump being out of office and a first time client speaks up.

“I wouldn’t be so sure of that.”

I immediately knew where this was going. He starts going on and on about how the military has taken control of the government and a bunch of arrests are coming. Clintons, Pelosi, Pence, etc.. He then goes onto say that February is the “month of pain” before we get to March where Trump will retake the Oval Office. 

He has a $9000 bet laid down that it’s for sure going to happen. We didn’t get into specifics of who he made this bet with but regardless he seemed telling the truth.

597,The Truth,"Hello, my name is Sage. I'm a 19 year old from England. I consider myself spiritual, skeptic and liberal.

My mum and her friend aren't necessarily Qanon supporters. They follow a variety of interpritation of our reality based on their personal 'research' but I question the reliability and bias in that research. Their beliefs would categorise themselves to others as conspiracy theorists but they like to consider themselves awake. 

One said she researched the pineal gland and that we have powers. 

My mum believes that the covid vaccine will rewrite everyones dna so they are no longer human. 

They also believe covid is a man made virus created by the government as a way of enforcing ""the new world order""

I am someone who doesnt like to talk on things unless I have researched them myself so I cant say they are right or wrong but the little I know about reality leads me to believe that it's most likely false information. Eg: I'm pretty sure it's not possible to rewrite a persons dna.

But the reason why I entertain these discussions is because it sounds like their is some truth to what they are saying and although unlikely some of what they say is possible. 

Eg: they believe the government is brainwashing people

Mk Ultra was a real program that existed. This is a fact. So what's to say that the government isn't brainwashing people today? 

Another example. Covid is man made 

Unit 731 was a real unit that existed during ww2 to test biological warfare. What's to say that experiments with similar goals havent been conducted since. 

I want to know the TRUTH. Has anyone took it upon themselves to research what they are saying? I have started but theres a lot to unpack and I dont just mean watch videos. I mean look up documents. Look up scientific studies. Cross refrencing research and recognising biases because I think their might be some truth to this but I want to seperate the bullshit from reality. 

Lastly, i am worried for my family. In a way the ""awake"" community seems like a cult where free thinking is falsely encouraged and anyone who doesnt believe the same thing has been programmed. 

I have had many arguments with my mum because I am some who asks too many questions in her eyes. We are not talking anymore. She thinks I'm too far gone because I had a covid test and she thinks I now have nano bots in her brain.

Has anyone been in the same position as me? What did you do? What did you find? Can you share research? And is this a cult? Can it still be a cult if some of what they say is true?",QAnonCasualties

599,Deprogram your loved one using Facebook and YouTube,"I want to thank user IllustriousStatus897 for his experience and the inspiration for this post. I replied to his post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lmk7kj/my_dad_quietly_deprogrammed_my_mom/) describing how his father assisted his mother in escaping the Q cult but I want to go into a little more detail here as I hope it might help some people to de-radicalize their relatives.

I think we all know that the primary nodes for radicalization on the Internet today are YouTube and Facebook. This is especially true of older relatives who have found their way into communities where extremist ideas and conspiracy theories are prevalent.

Both Facebook and YouTube use algorithmic systems to keep your attention on the site. These algorithms are intended to monitor what you enjoy, what gets and keeps your attention, and then deliver more of it. This is how fanatics and other bad actors utilize the internet to draw more people into their movements.

Once you click on a video you'll see more of that content, and this laser focused delivery system only becomes more effective the more you watch.

What I will suggest here are ways in which you can disrupt this process and potentially wean your loved one out of the delusion.

**YouTube**

YouTube is almost perfectly designed for radicalization. It has one goal - to keep you watching videos so that it can keep delivering ads and making money. By its very nature it's an ideal tool for cults and extremists because it does the brainwashing for them. All they need to do is supply the media, YouTube then does everything it can to lure people into the cult, because that's its business model.

So, how do you disrupt this?

Find something your relative loves. It can be anything. If you don't know of anything then make the focus cat or puppy videos. All you need is a healthy alternative they could be watching instead, something you're sure will catch their attention.

Let's just say you picked cat videos (everyone loves cats, right? If you don't, you're just wrong, sorry).

If you live with this relative and have access to the device they use then access it yourself when you can whenever they're not around. Don't be creepy about it, don't invade their privacy, but if there's a shared PC they usually watch Q videos on use it when they're not around to access cat videos. Watch as many as possible. Click like on them, maybe even leave a comment.

Gradually you'll replace the conspiracy theory videos with cat videos. Sure, they could just search for something themselves, but how many of them searched for Qanon in the first place? Most probably just clicked a link from Facebook and that started them on the algorithmic automation of radicalization.

After you've spent a few hours watching cat videos on that shared PC when they come back to YouTube they won't see ten new Qanon videos telling them the latest nonsense to believe, they'll see ten cute cat videos you haven't watched yet.

There's a very good chance that even if they're still seeing the occasional Q video they'll start to realize they're happier seeing cat videos.

Right now they're getting their endorphin hit from the outrage and fear of Q. The endorphin hit from laughing, or even just smiling, while watching a cat knock things off a table will be a more pleasant experience.

Let the cats radicalize them away from the fanatics.

In time you'll break the algorithmic hold YouTube has over your relative.

**Facebook**

While this might be harder given that you don't have access to their account, on their phone, you do have access to their feed by sending them content.

You need to compete with the fifty Qanon cult members feeding them radicalizing material and while that might sound daunting remember that you are their loved one, the other strangers on Facebook have no real connection to them other than the cult.

If you can, team up with other members of your family and your relative's friends to organize a gradual weaning away from the cult.

Consider building a team of people who will help you with this intervention, the more you have to assist you the easier this will be. Don't try to take everything on yourself.

As with the example for YouTube, pick something you believe they'll be interested in (cat videos, of course). Agree that you'll all look for a new video every day and send your loved one the link to it on Facebook. Join Facebook groups in your chosen theme and start sharing posts from it with your loved one. Find memes to post and tag them.

Of course you need to be subtle about it. Start out on your own, but tag other friends and family in the post as you go. Just keep it relaxed ""You should see this! So funny!"" your friend or relative on the team can back it up, get involved, start talking about it, share another one etc.

Start out slow, maybe begin with just you and a friend/relative, then a week later quietly ask another to help out and tag them in on the next post, and so on.

Just make sure the friends/relatives you approach to join the ""intervention team"" aren't invested in Q also.

Gradually this will divert their attention away from the unfulfilling Q cult they have immersed themselves in, while they themselves are indicating to the algorithms on both platforms that their interests have changed.

It doesn't even take long for this change to happen. Within a couple of days there's a good chance their media consumption could completely shift from Q to Cats.

Both platforms NEED your attention. They don't wait months, weeks or even days to start delivering what their algorithms think you want to see. As soon as your relative shows an interest in a subject other than Q the algorithms shift with it, the more they then click on what is suggested the more will be delivered, and the less Q will be seen.

**In conclusion**

The algorithms on these platforms didn't have to work hard to lure your relative in. One click was likely all it took. With few alternative interests ready to intercept this programming that one click then told the algorithms to deliver more, and more, and more.

Once you start to break the hold those algorithms have on your loved one you'll probably start to see a change within days.

I'll admit that I've been a proponent of abandoning those who succumbed to the cult, because they can indeed be dangerous. However, it could take you and a few friends just an hour a day of sourcing alternative media and messaging to wean them out of this cult, and surely they're worth that.

So what do you say?

Are you gonna recruit the cats to deprogram your loved one?

So, don't give up on them. Let the cats radicalize them away from Q.",QAnonCasualties

Discussing how Kamala harris was supposed to hurt Biden and take over as the communism queen. 
All of this, whilst emotionally abusing me. She was never a nice mom, undiagnosed BPD and many mental and mommy issues of her own. She treats me like fucking shit. I am terrified to block her because after trump losing , I’m scared she is going to kill herself. She was there for me when my real dad was not, and it is just terrifying to see.

Hi all, very worried about my mom. She is on the teetering edge of becoming a full blown conspiracy theorist and I want to know if there is any way I can pull her out. 

She’s been sending me things about the COVID vaccine and how it’s not real or safe. She’s very Catholic (voted for Trump twice), but has been leaning more towards fringe Catholic news. The video she sent me today featured a woman encouraging people to go out and touch others, and that the vaccine could easily be cured with “holy” oils. 

When I responded telling her that what she sent me was a conspiracy theory and that I was worried, she said, “Thanks for your concern but I don't trust the mainstream media.  I have seen the bias for myself.” I’m aware many news sources are biased, but what can I say to her to get her to just... fact check?

It went from human trafficking in hollywood, to blood sacrifices, demonic intentions of celebrities, illuminati, and worse and worse until one day she asked me if I thought the would was flat or round!
She seems to fully believes that the world's flat, the moons fake, we live in a simulation, lots of celebrities are dead and replaced with clones! She asked if I knew about lizard people???

Existing inquiry into QAnon has largely been driven by surveys, ethnography, and journalistic reporting yet little is known *at scale* about QAnon’s loosely affiliated community. Many people working to counter this extremism can’t afford the research they need to know where to go next.

One-off, fast-moving research projects can be invaluable to understanding, responding to, and counteracting cultural trends in real-time, but are often challenging to fund. That’s why we ([Harmony Labs](https://harmonylabs.org/)) just launched a new Kickstarter campaign to provide the research media companies, journalists, storytellers, and concerned friends and family of QAnon believers need to address QAnon online.

This research will be carried out rapidly and in full public view, with transparency of analysis, results, and datasets, and with direct input from supporters of the campaign. The project will produce a fully designed, interactive, public website to ensure findings are easy to use, accessible, and actionable. In this way, we can start equipping people with the tools and resources they need to counter Q.

We would appreciate any support and feedback this community has to offer. You can find out more on our website or find our campaign on the Kickstarter website.",QAnonCasualties
612,In-law rant,"My wife and to a lesser extent her sister don’t know what to make of their mom these days. She said her mom once was a big believer in this obvious hoax religion maybe 10+ years ago and ordered books and sent money to the religious leader guy who turned around and bought an island or something, so she seems susceptible to conspiracies. 

Then came Trump and Q. She spouts the anti vax George Soros global puppet master kind of rhetoric and now is readying for the apocalypse and Biden will any day turn this country over to China. My wife has tried to have conversations but the mom is combative and is quick to anger and then throws insults like snowflake and then gets to cursing and my wife can’t really talk her down from it.

“Mom I still love you and we don’t have to talk about this stuff if it upsets you and we don’t have to agree on everything” is where my wife tries to end it when it gets futile, but recently her mom upped the ante and chastised her for not christening our kids and how they’ll be godless antifa snowflakes out to cancel every republican just like us.

Her dad doesn’t agree or disagree but tries to mediate and mostly just keep her mom from getting more irate, but at this rate I don’t know what else can be done.

615,I’m worried that my mom is losing herself to conspiracy theories.,"She was already pretty convinced that COVID was engineered in Wuhan and that it may or may not have been released by accident. She definitely believes some of the election fraud claims, but not all of them. Her in laws (she’s married to a trumper with very extreme right parents) have definitely fed her some stuff. She does fact check things, but she has certain websites she fact checks, and doesn’t trust outside sites.

Last night my step grandpa had a heart attack and was hospitalized. It happened late at night, so she woke me up and told me and then she and my step dad left me at home so they could meet the ambulance. The next morning I asked her how he was.

She immediately launched into how he got the vaccine so that’s what caused his heart attack. Not that he’s 90 years old and weighed over 300 lbs most of his life. She was telling me all this stuff about the vaccine and she didn’t even tell me if he was alive or dead until I stopped her and asked about his condition. He’s alive and it looks like he’ll be ok, but we’re pretty rural so we won’t know the extent of the damage until he sees a cardiologist in the city today.

The local doctor was saying that probably he had a blood clot that became loose for one reason or another, she isn’t sure. My mom is convinced that the vaccine caused the heart attack and seemed to doubt the existence of the clot as she talked about it. She was really upset only his wife, my step grandma, could go see him, and that she refused to record the doctor to show her after what they said.

It’s scary to me that that’s the first place her mind jumped. She’s normally such a smart person who doesn’t lend a lot of credence to conspiracy theories at all. We’ve had like at length conversations about internalized racial bias and the prison industrial complex for fuck’s sake.

What even can I do? It’s not like she watches Fox News or gets her info from Facebook. I think she’s scared and lost in the state of the world like the rest of us and is in danger of falling into toxic ways of coping with those feelings.

It isn’t like she’s hard into QAnon or anything— but I’m worried she might fall into that, too, as she gets deeper and deeper.",QAnonCasualties

617,"I spent another month documenting QAnon believers and influencers on Gab, to see how they were evolving during the first month of Biden's presidency","Hey there, guys. I'm a journalist who couldn't help but become fascinated by QAnon in the months leading up to the election. I rarely write about ""politics,"" but I couldn't help myself from falling down the rabbit hole of wanting to document QAnon, because it strikes me as the most important sociological pitfall of our current age. To that end, I spent months between Nov. 3 and Inauguration Day chronicling QAnon beliefs and deconstructing them on sites such as Parler and Gab. I posted that piece here a month ago and got lots of really great feedback and support. It was this piece, here. 

https://www.pastemagazine.com/politics/qanon/qanon-trump-parler-gab-conspiracy-theories-inauguration-day/

I sort of hoped that this would be the end of my spending so much time reading QAnon rants on Gab, but it didn't take long before I came to feel like I needed to do it one more time, in order to capture how the vibe of QAnon communities is continuing to evolve during Biden's actual presidency. I wanted to see how they were all coping/rationalizing/raging during this period, when any person looking at the situation dispassionately would be able to conclude that Trump had lost.

Suffice to say, the QAnon believers who are still there have just dug themselves in deeper, but that's to be expected. There are all kinds of crazy new conspiracy theories, etc., etc. But I also feel like a lot of Q believers have been dealt a big blow, and I think many of them have melted away from these communities. There's a feeling that they're incredibly fractured last now, given the lack of central leadership. Different groups within QAnon believe vastly different things, and infighting is common. It seems to suggest they'll have an increasing difficulty uniting on anything.

Anyway. Here is the result of spending the last month continuing to read thousands of QAnon posts on Gab, etc.

I will admit as the conversation progressed, I did get more and more childish, saying I would lick the vaccine site a few times for good measure and send him pictures of my getting the vaccine along with necessary paperwork that went along with it. This was all last night. In the morning, I woke up to an article on Mark Zuckerberg's opinion of the vaccine that he sent me. How do I end this madness that my sister started? She apologized last night because I don't think she realized that telling him would result in him immediately cussing me out.

And yes, before you go digging around in my mouth, I'd really prefer you to have been vaccinated against a potentially deadly airborne pathogen. Then she started in with the typical copy and paste Q stuff about child trafficking. 

But as my wife and I were headed out for service, my brother called and told me something really disturbing. Apparently her husband has had to hide his adderall prescription from her. He said she doesn't take it regularly, but she often takes it for no reason whatsoever. Would explain the bizarre, manic behavior I've observed on a few occasions. But what worries me is this: I know that sort of thing is a slippery slope. After watching my sister's slide into addiction, SHE should know it. When that adderall stops working, she's likely to seek other ways of getting that feeling. And she lives in a county that's been repeatedly called ""The Meth Capital of Georgia.""",QAnonCasualties

621,My dad quietly deprogrammed my mom,"Sorry for my poor english, I am not from the USA and I do not regularly use reddit so this is also just an account I made for this one post, I hope that is okay. 

I just found out very recently that my mother has been becoming a Q follower over the last couple of  years and how my 65 year old dad has managed to quietly deprogram her on her own without anybody of us knowing. My mom has always believed in weird things like healing crystals but as far as I know she never went overboard with it. She was always a ""If you have a fever a crystal will help but if it's worse go to the doctor immediately"" kinda person. But she fell deep into a q hole around 2017/8. She never really talked about it with us outside of some ""deep state"" comments which don't really mean anything where I live so we just ignored it. ""It's just a phase"" came up very often. But it was way worse than we thought.

However my dad was not taking this. He, all by himself, figured out how to block websites, lock tv channels etc. This might not sound like much but my dad is the MOST dad when it comes to computers. He is the kind of dad who regularly calls me and asks how to create folders etc. He hates computers. But he spent months, literally actual months, figuring this all out by himself. He blocked Facebook and other weird Q sites (including reddit), blocked Youtube channels and replaced them with progressively less stupid ones (going from conspiracy theories to healing crystal channels and then to Opera and cooking channels etc.). He also did whatever he could to keep her from the computer, going on weekend trips and (before covid) even taking her to the Opera. My mom always wanted to go but my dad *HATES* it. I don't think words can describe how much he hates the Opera. Still does. And yet he took her there as often as he could afford it. And signed her up on Opera forums just so she would spend more time talking with these harmless people instead.   
Again, I cannot stress enough how impressive it is that my dad accomplished this. My dad who once asked me if you need the internet to receive e-mails.

I bet you are now asking ""Why didn't he asked you for help?"". Thing is, I had no idea this was going on. I see my parents somewhat regularly but again, some weird comments aside my mom never really said anything about Q. And we don't talk about politics at all. I only found out about all of this happening by accident (I won't get into details here, it's long and not that interesting tbh)

So, why did my dad not say anything? When he told me everything he had done he said he didn't want us (my sisters and me) to think bad of my mother. I cannot even describe how I felt when he said that. I'm not sure a word for this feeling exists. It's somewhere between heartbroken because we left him alone doing all this but also warm because he cared so much but also frightened because it could have all gone wrong as well.  
My mom is now pretty much back to normal and now that we know she is talking about her experiences a lot with us, even tho she is clearly ashamed of herself (obviously we constantly tell her how proud of her we are and that she doesn't need to be ashamed anymore). She has deleted her Facebook account and has completely cut out real life Q ""friends"" she met during her Q time from her life.

623,Is Q-fam lost or is there a chance? Neutral voice of reason &amp; rational/logical thinking but all my Q-contrary &amp; debunking evidence is 'run by the cabal/libs/dems!’,"I feel for a lot of members within this sub. I'm fortunate in the sense my family has not (yet) exiled me for voicing my opinions (or rather facts) when it comes to debunking their Q related claims. For example the latest claim was ""Spongebob's address is the same as Epstein's pedo-park in the Virgin Islands!"" This was of course already debunked and upon trying to explain how several sites detailed how someone simply edited the address to that of Spongebob's 🍍 124 Conch Street via Google Maps they refuse to accept my proof and state that all of the sites or articles (20+) I used for reference and evidence to debunk this claim are ""run by the cabal and liberals."" 🤦‍♂️

I continue to try and be the neutral voice of rational and logical thinking but every time I attempt to prove their Q related claims are false the evidence is never good enough! I know they want to believe everything they read regarding Q is true because it's not only what they WANT to believe but also what they HOPE is true and fact. (Sounds like a liberal but I'll not say THAT to them...yet) Unfortunately such belief of these frivolous claims and disputing all concrete evidence is where their rational thinking ends.

Now it's their belief/hope (or let them tell it: what's GOING to happen without a doubt) the Supreme Court is going to overturn the election results this Friday 2/19/21. After reminding them the SC has already dismissed several states cases regarding election fraud they then proceed to claim the military will overturn the election if the SC doesn't. They also believe the military is in control of the country, Biden is incarcerated and speaking from a movie set within a cell (possibly Gitmo from what they gather) it's the usual Qniverse claims that have mislead so many others already. Of course if none of the above actually comes to play out then ""Trump will be inaugurated come March 4th!"" 🤦‍♂️

I will still continue to be the neutral voice of reason and rationality, but what more can I do to try and get them to drink less of the red Kool-Aid, pop fewer red pills, and start RESEARCHING some of these claims made by Q or others in the internet? As I said, just because you believe it's true and hope it's truth doesn't mean that it's actually true! But I honestly don't know how to go about getting them to fall back and straddle the fence by researching BOTH sides of the story before automatically jumping to the conclusion it's 100% fact or going to happen solely because it's what they WANT to happen and be true.

I've already labeled them Qanon Casualties (which they hate because Q is law) but in the same breath I have a slight feeling of hope because come 3/4/21 when nothing happens and it's just another day I'm hoping they realize 'hey...maybe Q was wrong and not everything Q claims is true.' Only time will tell but I have hope they will start to return to their senses and think RATIONALLY once they realize they have no choice but to accept the reality they're living in and stop believing everything they want to believe on the internet is actually canon and fact just because they want it to be true and play out. Nothing but a false sense of hope and security!

TLDR: Fam believes literally everything Q says is fact and true because it's what they want to be fact and true. But they don't research anything and refuse to believe anything that contradicts any Q claims even when the evidence or debunk is concrete solid and proven fact. How can I get them to start researching before jumping to the conclusion everything they read is true solely because it's what they want to be true? Or is this a lost cause and have I already lost them to Q entirely?",QAnonCasualties
624,"I ""accidentally"" dropped a tip to my local news station about a certain chiropractor promoting vaccine hesitancy/denial to clients (my father). I still can't prove they are sending clients insane videos about nano-technology in the vaccines and COVAIDS, but what should I say if they respond?","I went on the local news station vaccine tip page for sharing tips. I started to fill out a tip form just to see what info they were looking for. I was expecting a longer form to complete but as soon as I filled out the topic, ""Chiropractors promoting vaccine skepticism"" I hit next and got a message saying thanks for the tip. We will be in touch if we need more information. Woops. I provided no specific details.

If they reach out I'm thinking it's ok to say:

*""My father recently texted the family a very concerning anti-vaccine video that he said was from his ""doctor"". I looked up one of the clinics he visits which is actually a chiropractor's office that promotes anti-vax sentiments. I think he is referring to his chiropractor when he texted the video. I am not accusing anybody of anything and I don't know for sure that this chiropractor has actually scared my father or others away from getting vaccinated, but they are promoting anti-vax messages and debunked and/or banned from YouTube videos on their website. I thought it was something newsworthy and important that there are health professionals promoting anti-vaccination misinformation during the pandemic. Please do what you like with this information I'm providing and keep this tip anonymous.""*

I **DO NOT** want to accuse anybody of doing something I cannot prove such as sending direct to clients bizarre videos about the vaccine. I do not want to slander anybody or damage their business with something I cannot prove and might be entirely wrong about. I do know what they have to say about vaccines on their very public website though. 

It may be this chiropractor's right to promote vaccine skepticism and if it is, so be it.  But he is pushing anti-vax info on his website so that's public knowledge. Maybe he even thinks it's good for his business?  A ""health"" professional promoting anti-vax views at this time is pretty newsworthy in my opinion and if he gets shamed into keeping his vaccine opinions to himself in the future then that's a win. If he's breaking any regulations then shame on him. 

The bonus is that I accidentally tipped off the station my father watches in the morning.

I feel a little guilty, but getting called out could save a life or two. And yeah, they also promote a lot of other pseudoscientific services and products that are bogus.

Just an aside about chiropractors and credentials: I work with a ton of people in the science community with PhDs. None of them feel the need to be called Dr. and in fact, would prefer not to be. Is somebody fishing for credibility?",QAnonCasualties

That was basically until he started talking a lot of non sense about q anon, 5g technology, covid, a “big reveal” happening in the next 3 months ( keep in mind the last time I talked to him was in the first week of October) and many other conspiracies. The worst of which is an article entitled “5G Technology and induction of coronavirus in skin cells.” While the q anon has been the latest, I saw him place his belief in a few things I knew wouldn’t last. At one point he even really had a fear of god and started reading the Bible, (I’m not religious) only to have that last for maybe a few months before he stopped believing in it and having those same feelings. While I could post more detailed conversations, I implore you to look up the article he sent me. And tell me how you can make any sense of a retracted article. He really believes in a deep state pedophile organization. He’s also arming himself to the teeth, which honestly leads me to believe some day we might have to defend ourselves from these nut jobs. I never considered myself a violent person, but when you have someone with multiple hand guns, a bullet proof vest, and a semi automatic rifle and a corrupt mind. I feel as if we would be doing ourselves a disservice to not arm ourselves on the side of truth and reason. Honestly, I look at the fbi capitol rioters list just to make sure he wasn’t there because I think people like him need to be taken off the street.

632,My take on Q and how it has destroyed this once proud Italian american family.,"  

&gt;My family immigrated to the US from Italy in the 30’s. They worked in the mines of Appalachia because this was the work they knew and were skilled at.  Fast forward to the second generation… Our family has been split down the middle by QAnon. Some of us chose to continue the families love for adventure and exploration by traveling and extending our boundaries beyond the borders of WV and Pennsylvania, and some decided to stay. The ones that left, are mostly left leaning moderate Catholics who respect all cultures and religions, it’s just how we were raised; however, the ones that stayed behind, adopted a more local mind set and political views. Now, I have no animosity toward family members staying local, but mention this only to give context to the current Q situation within my family or clan.  The Q mythos has completely absorbed a good portion of my family. More the second generation than the first. The first generation still held true to the ethics and values of their parents. But something happened to the second generation, they became more nationalistic, xenophobic and racist, completely forgetting where they came from. I attribute this to the lack of struggle and pain our grandparents felt.  Enter Q… about half of my family has gone to the dark side but the worst has to be my Q-ousin and his wife. They have never, except for an occasional trip to the Outer banks of NC, left the borders of WV. They believe deeply in Pizza gate; the election was stolen and anyone not a trump supporter is a communist satanic homosexual pedophile who kills babies to drink their blood. I am ashamed and astounded that they really believe this!  I can go on and on but the bottom line is that Q preys on the weak and uneducated (Nothing to do with formal education) … the ones who have never experienced outside stimuli and cultures. I once loved my Q-ousin, but because I am now a baby killing communist pedophile I am no longer worthy of his time. Just my own Q experience.",QAnonCasualties

637,Can we save Q/conspiracy people by click-baiting them into actual research?,"Hi all. I've faced the similar struggle as many of you of losing a loved one to conspiracy theories. I'll spare you the details about how it's negatively impacted me. But I just made this burner account to post here because today, I came up with a rough idea that could possibly help pull our people out this mania. 

Like many of you, my lost one's ego and livelihood is fueled by ""doing research"" and ""knowing things"" that other people don't. ""Sorry sheep, I'm on a different level than you, you haven't read the papers or done the research,"" they've told me and others close to them. Today, they texted me yet another disoriented bitchute video about why we need to fear the covid vaccine. After watching, and politely refuting a few points in the video with medical journal research available online, I came to realize a few things about how/why they consume misinformation and how we could possibly combat it:

1.) Many of these people will not trust or consider things that are not on media channels like bitchute.

2.) They NEED to feel like they are discovering information themselves that ""other people"" don't know about.

3.) Clickbait titles that scream ""Oh my god!!! X is going to happen if Y and no one is talking about it!!""

4.) The life values presented in the videos are valid much of the time.

Each conspiracy theory video appeals to their values, like freedom, which many sane Americans can agree with and relate to. These values are totally valid. For example, the antivax video I got sent today opened with a solid philosophical argument about informed medical consent, which is important. However, the problem with antivaxers as you know, is that they are not properly informed. So we could take a ""get informed, don't let them give you the jab without the facts"" approach by click-baiting them into \*actual\* research on their preferred channels. For example, we could upload actual educational videos with clickbait titles to bitchute with legit videos about how vaccines work. Like scare the shit out of people into actually learning something real to pull them out. ""They don't want you to know Pfizer's mRNA vaccine does THIS to your cells!!"" And then the bitchute video can be an immunologist first appealing to their values describing how it's important to have informed medical consent/freedom and then can go into the specific science about how mRNA vaccines actually interact with your cells.

Do you think posting on their media channels in this way is a good idea? Why or why not? What holes am I missing here? What other ideas do you have related to this? How could we go about something like this? Thanks!",QAnonCasualties

For promotion, I am completing a second master’s degree in New Media Production. For my Master’s thesis I wanted to create something that would help people, so I am creating a documentary, and I could use your help. 

While there has been reporting on Qanon and the rift it’s caused within families, there has been little work on how we might work to help bring people back toward the middle of the political spectrum. I’ve enlisted a group of social workers to help me with specific tactics that we can teach to family members who want to try and help reach their Qanon/extremist family members.

\-People in the Greater St. Louis area who might be willing to undergo training from these experts and are willing to then reach out to their family member using the skills

\-Information on any other experts or people who might want to speak with me

641,You can't fight hate with hate. It just makes more hate.,"The title is self explanatory and most on here are not hating but sharing their experiences. However there is a hate growing in some of these threads for anyone right wing and a growing culture that assumes everyone right if center is part of Q. May I just remind everyone that these are our neighbors and friends and family members. My roommate is still struggling with Q, my parents are spouting things that clearly originated from Q even though they don't even seem to know what exactly Q is. 
These people are not going to just die or disappear so beating them into the ground with hatred is only going to push them further away, I like my roommate even if I dont like his politics, I want to be able to put politics aside and just be friends, and even more than that I want to be able to discuss political views, agree or disagree, then put it away when we are done and be able to still see each other as morally gray, imperfect people who have been the hero and the villain in different situations through out their lives.
Here's an exercise that's healthy to try: think back and try to remember a time when you were the bad guy, times when you were wrong and would not admit it. Can you imagine fighting passionately for a cause that you think is for the greater good and then come to realize you've been part of something ugly or even evil? 
The cheering of Rush Limbaugh's death is an ugly sight, he was no angel but certainly not evil either, and I'm surprised at how it becomes ok to hate someone who's views are problematic even when they are dead dancing on their graves like it's some great victory. I'd expect that response to the death of Ted Bundy but not a political commentator, even if sometimes he was outright wrong, even morally wrong to say atrocious things. 
I invite everyone to think of a person as a 4 dimensional being. A physical, mental, spiritual and time dimension is a jungian way of seeing people. Theres the you from 10 years ago, the you today and the you that could be tomorrow or 10 years from now. 
People need to be allowed to make mistakes and come back from that with acceptance, if they admit they were wrong and you throw it in their face they will never admit to being wrong ever again and they wont listen to you either.

Now, I'm a Democrat and voted for Biden (though I don't like him, he was just preferable), and I'm often mistaken for being LGBT due to my haircut and the way I dress (though I'm not). 

I asked one of the store managers to tell her to stop spouting this nonsense, and the manager I told did tell her to stop, but I think I overheard her say, ""I agree with you"", though my hearing sucks and that could've been in a different context than I think.

I don’t want to act paranoid, but I don't want to be attacked in any way when I get the vaccine or if it slips out that I'm democratic or liberal. I don't talk about politics in the workplace much at all, but it's pretty clear I'm not conservative.

Ashli Babbitt was a paid actress who never actually died,   
Biden never rode in the real Air Force One,

He very much reminds me of my father, who is also neck-deep in Q as well.

655,Qanon has gotten to my sister," 

Hello Everyone. I'm just hear to vent about how Qanon has completely taken over my sister's life.

My sister and I didn't always have the easiest relationship. She was definitely more emotional, took things personally, and acted on emotions and a bit paranoid while I would always joke around, not serious (which annoyed her but also other people in my family) be more logical, and try to put everything in perspective and find a solution. This is not to say she didn't have great qualities, she was also really funny and we would sometimes be going back and forth with jokes that left our family laughing for hours. She would also care a lot for animals and people and didn't let people bs or lie when she was around.

But as grew older we grew more separate (like most siblings) I studied in America and she did as well but she came back to the Netherlands a year before me to study her Masters and I did the same as well. I only started to see a change in her when I came back and she came to visit me. We were just talking and she just starting about being Christian and how abortion is bad. Now that wasn't a red flag or anything for me but it was very surprising because our family was always non religious and the closest person being religious was me growing up somewhat following Islam. But I thought fine if she is happy then I'm happy and the rest of the trip went fine.

What happened next came more from my mother who expressed concerns with stuff my sister would tell her. I didn't it myself because we would usually make jokes with each other and never get serious. She was telling me about how she was becoming more anti vaccination and that she didn't believe the world was round. So when they visited me again during dinner I was very surprised to hear it myself because I didn't believe it and that also she believed that they were using aeroplanes to kill us. I remember distinctly her saying that she doesn't believe anything NASA says but then I said ""you know other countries have satellites in space as well right"" and she went quiet because she didn't have an answer for that and she added that there was a plane that had shown data that the earth wasn't round but then I just said""10s of thousands of planes fly every year around the earth, wouldn't they see that then as well"" I also went on about how gravity and physics wouldn't work how we know it then and that was the end of it. She didn't have arguments for it so I thought it was done. My mother and I talked after that about how strange that she would think that especially since they were so different than what she believed before.

A lot of things happened inbetween including multiple shouting matches with backing Trump and talking about how democrats are the devil and also backing a politicalparty here in the Netherlands that is big into conspiracy theories but the breaking point was with something that happened to me. While I was living in America I had a bad encounter with the police and with myself being black and the other person being white and almost being arrested myself for saving a woman from that guy but luckily there were many witnesses who supported me and shouted to the cops what really happened (don't want to get real into it) So when George Floyd happened I decided to share my story on facebook. I went to my family (including my sister) to help me formulate my story so it wasn't confusing. Now I told this story to my sister years before and she believed me then and was fighting for me but she has changed her mind. She was talking about how perspectives are different and that her perspective was different from mine. Well that was complete bullshit since she wasn't there and that was just another way of saying I don't believe you anymore. I'm not a shouty person so I just told that I don't think we should speak anymore. I haven't spoken to her since then and I really don't plan to. One of the things growing up that we both really struggled with was race and how having a white mother and black father was being too white for the black kids and too black for the white kids. She was so adamantly anti racist and was always my voice as my big sister growing up against it. And for her to turn on me on one of the most traumatic things I have experienced was too much and I couldnt do it anymore.

My mother still holds onto hope that she can reach her and every time she talks to me about her I try to support her and not show my true feelings that I think she is gone. My sister is almost 30 now with no job and no real plan to get one and still needs my parents to help her with the smallest things. Not sure if she takes care of herself but she has no friends and just talks to this boy from Texas and said that she would move there. I really only get emotional now because I'm afraid by the time my mother passes away my sister will be in the same spot or worse and that she couldn't save her. My mother is honestly the sweetest person in the world and I don't want her heart broken.

657,"America's Frontline ""Doctors"" and the viral video by Simone Gold - Advice for debunking vaccine skeptics (even when they are doctors)","I'm not sure what to do anymore. My dad and I have been at odds for the past 4 years over Trumpism, gradually getting worse each year. However these last couple months since Biden was elected and took office, I was beginning to see a light at the end of this dark MAGA red tunnel. My dad was more himself and filled with less hate, negativity and skepticism. Things were looking up. He recently won his battle with cancer a couple months ago and had his last chemo treatment in the fall. He is eligible for the vaccine and was excited about it - even had his appointment made. Then last week he watched a viral video from Simone Gold (America's Frontline ""Doctors"") and now has changed his mind. It was a 50 minute long video about how the vaccine is experimental (like of course it is? most of medicine is) and how it can cause infertility and then *casually* mentions government tracking (OK). My dad sent this link to me and it only took a quick google search to find out besides spreading vaccine misinformation, she was also arrested for being involved in the capitol attack (shocker). I sent various links to these articles and all he did was get mad at me. 

He was never on the full QAnon train and really never bought into conspiracies before. He watches Fox News but doesn't have any social media. He's normally practical and on the positive side of everything. He was a big Trumper but him not accepting defeat with grace - and then the Capitol attack really opened his eyes (though he would never admit it). He's middle of the road, not too far down the conspiracy rabbit hole yet. Does anyone have any tips for debunking a doctor like **Simone Gold?** Or have had any similar experiences with **America's Frontline Doctors?** I can't believe this is the first I'm hearing of this organization or group or whatever they are. 

My intent isn't to trick him into anything, I want him to WANT to get this vaccine and to see the truth again but it is a constant battle against misinformation and his friends who believe in this shit. I love him very much and worry this video could cost him his life. Any advice is helpful!",QAnonCasualties
658,Family fractured by Q - Feeling hopeless,"In just one year I have lost my mother -- once a vibrant, kind, empathetic soul -- to the bowels of Parler and the conspiracies that abound. She has tried to convince me not to get vaccinated, my sister has called me a pedophile, and before the inauguration they tried to force me onto signal because they were convinced we would lose contact. The two of them have shrivelled away into paranoid, angry, and delusional people with no sense of reality. My Mom doesn't work, she's married to my amazing father who has supported her with a very comfortable life for years. And yet she's acting like the end of the world is upon us. It's infuriating to see someone who is so privileged acting like this.   


I'm despondent because I live in Mexico and have not seen them in quite some time. No one except for my father calls me to ask how I'm doing, how my job is going, whether I'm healthy, etc. The only time we have contact is if I call them, in which case I have to bite my tongue the entire time. My father has expressed that the situation with my mom is really bad -- for the first time in my life I wonder if there's a possibility that they will divorce. There's not much for them to talk about anymore.   


We thought that after the inauguration they would calm down. But in my last conversation with my mother I could tell she still believes ""something"" is going to happen. My question is, what the f\*ck do these people think is happening in March? I try to follow along through resources like this reddit group, etc. It helps me to know what they think is going on (despite it all being crazy) so that I can prepare myself for the commentary. Does anyone know?   


I'm so tired of feeling this despondent. And angry! I almost have to disassociate sometimes because when I think about it for too long I start feeling awful things toward people I love.

661,Just got disowned,"I don't know if this is the right place to post but it seemed like the closest thing. I disowned by my father yesterday due to my support of the BLM movement in addition to some other things. I always assumed it would be because I am gay, or trans, or because I was planning never to have children but no it was because I called him out for being violently racist and misogynistic and homophobic. Then he called me an n-word lover and told me to go to *predominantly black neighborhood near me* and become a pr// stitute for them since I loved them so much and disowned me. 

I don't think he is a q believer but this is someone who genuinely admires Hitler and Trump. He wanted to join the proud boys but when I pointed out they would hate him (he's Chinese) he said I was getting brainwashed by my college and liberal media and that if I had two brain cells to rub together I would know that he was right. He didn't like it when I pointed out I would have more brain cells if he didn't you know smash my head into a window breaking it once and abuse me regularly as a child. Obviously it wasn't safe so I had to move out to live with my mom who luckily was already divorced.

Here's the kicker: my mom is a q believer. Although she is a better person than my dad, she saw this as an opportunity to get me to see the light. I'm just absolutely exhausted by everything. This isn't the first time this has happened, my dad and I had a fight on election night as well and I ran to my mom but she and the rest of my family convinced me I was overreacting and that he didn't mean it, that me telling him he was being racist was the same thing as him telling me to become a who /// re. And as soon as I go back, this happens. 

At this point, I'm just numb. I'm not even upset that I just got disowned by a parent. I don't even see him as a parent anymore. I'm absolutely disgusted at this man and I have no sympathy for him at all. I even feel cleaner after being disowned. The first few times I was filled with rage and helplessness and now I only have disgust and contempt. The only interaction I ever want to have with him again is to spit on his grave.",QAnonCasualties

663,Yesterday I wrote about an antivax video forwarded from my father's Dr. I'm 95% sure I found the culprit and he's a chiropractor. I only have what's on his website. I can't accuse him of directly sending anything to my father &amp; I have to remain anonymous. What can I do with the info that I have?,"I'm not going to just make wild accusations of a professional spamming 5g, nano-fiber, living COVIDAIDS from Bill Gates videos at his clients. I can't even 100% say that the video link originally came from the chiropractor. I wouldn't put it past my father to link two semi-related things and send it out to others. It's not OK for a medical professional to send something like that out. I don't know if I can report them for what is on their website plain as day, or if that vaccine skeptic material is OK in my state, CO.

Here was the text sent to me and 5 others - *“Please, please, please listen to this as if you're life depends, on it, because it does. Sent from my Dr. to me. Please do not take a COVID test and especially the vaccine*!🙏❤️🇺🇸 

The Dr. my father refers to is most like his chiropractor, not an MD,  that runs an anti-aging and regenerative medical center. His website features anti-vax articles and attached to some  ""Freedom"" websites, videos starring Dr. Judy ""Plandemic"" Mikovits removed by YouTube, and videos from elsewhere. I know about the chiropractor and anti-vax connection already. I'm planning on calling the state medical board and regional chiropractor organization, but I don't have proof he sent anything directly to my father. 

 From the forwarded video:

&gt;  *""It's not a vaccine but a cellular GENETIC MODIFICATION technology, admittedly designed to give those ignorant enough to take it........ a self-creating AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE similar to what used to be called.......AIDS""* **COVIDS** transhuman, nano-technology, eugenics driven democide and genocide. We have all been duped by germ theory. Bill Gates is turning us into walking, talking cellphones, something about a horrific brain parasite and the nano-particles are apparently alive and will fight each other. And that's just the test. Mind control and DNA manipulation. 5G frequencies. Crypto slave wages.   **THEY ARE LITERALLY GIVING YOU AIDS.** 

Below is anti-vax content from the clinic website. I'm not sure what the state's laws are for chiropractors (D.C.)s regarding medical misinformation. The chiropractor is pretty comfortable putting this out there as pragmatic skepticism. The video I watched was something entirely different. 

&gt;As a healthcare professional that has been in private practice for almost 20 years it concerns me that our medical freedoms are under attack and our right to make informed medical decisions for ourselves and our family may be taken away.  
&gt;  
&gt;Imagine how you will feel when the day comes that you cannot make your own decision about a medical procedure being performed on you, your spouse, your child, your parents, your siblings!   
&gt;  
&gt;What is wrong with asking questions?  Why is it so difficult to have an ‘objective’ conversation about vaccines?  Why are we not looking at who is funding the research that is being pushed down our throats? Is that research industry funded?  Are there significant ‘conflicts of interest’ by the researchers or investors of the research?  
&gt;  
&gt;The point is, get involved in learning as much as youcan so you can make a more informed, objective and less emotional decision.for you and your family.  You just might be surprised at what you find out…..and you may help to thwart an attempt to take away more of your medical freedoms!

I've always had a toxic and abusive relationship with my parents but it was ultimately politics and conspiracies that dragged us down to the point of no return. It started with them flipping out about BLM, to BLM being antifa, to antifa and pedophiles destroying the country,  etc etc. This would start the moment I would walk in the door, from my grandmother and dad. I would have to leave the room or nod my head in silence to keep the peace. Sometimes I disassociated. The only reason I kept going over there was so my kids [3 years, 11 months] could see their grandparents. The first time my grandmother started acting out against them was the last straw, though- I decided at that point that I wasn't taking them over there anymore, which made me into the villain. There was a talk with my mom because we wanted to try to fix it but then the gaslighting and excuses for their behavior started and I realized that I lost her too. My brother is mentally disabled, so it took them no effort to feed him their conspiracies and turn him against me. Just like that, our bond was gone and he stopped talking to me ... he was the one I protected and cared about the most.

It's been 6 months since I last saw or spoke to them. I thought I would be feeling at least a little bit better by now. I don't regret cutting off communication at all because it was for mine and my kids wellbeing ... it's just that they weren't even the slightest bit upset that I left, and I think that's what hurts the most- like Trump and Q were more important than me and I just became the crazy, misinformed disappointment.

Anyway, thanks for letting me get it out. It blew my mind when I started learning that this has happened to so many other people. I'm trying to cope as best as I can, though some days are harder than others.",QAnonCasualties
669,"Sad, angry, scared...","This is a long rant/ask for help:

 Growing up in a small rural farm town, I couldn’t wait to leave for college. I remember life before 24hr news channels, and it was a much more simple time. My family would watch Dan Rather at the end of the day, and that was most of the news we would consume aside from the Today show in the mornings waiting to leave for school.

Sometime around the 2000 election, Fox News was always a fixture on the TV, ever present during dinner, breakfast, always on... and it got worse after 9/11. I remember getting scolded for changing the channel to MSNBC, “you liberals...”. I always loved my mom and step dad, and felt bad for them when they reacted like this. Similar to when my stepdad stopped me during dinner one night when I was discussing how I learned that dinosaur fossils were millions of years old, only for him to “remind” me how the Earth was only 5,000 years old, and those fossils are tests of faith. 🤦‍♂️ 

I give all of this to you as context. This was my house growing up, and I somehow survived and broke free. 

My family had pressured me into joining the Navy to pay for college, and I had never truly felt that was the path for me. I was more interested in music, and played guitar in a metal band during high school. And yet, I found myself at the Military Entry Processing Station (MEPS) and inches away from signing my life over to the military. I froze, dropped the pen, and said “I’m sorry, I just can’t do this”. That setup one of the most awkward days of my life, having to sit in the lobby with other recruits while waiting to head back home (5 hr car ride, recruiter picked a few of us up). I was also the last to be dropped off. 

This was a departure from my family’s control over me, and where I finally started to assert myself and my views. Needless to say, things were never the same with my parents. As I went off to college in 2007, I didn’t understand that would be the last time my family would be whole. 

My mother’s health started to become an issue around 2009, and she was growing apart from my step dad. I had made a lot of friends at college, and I also had a job keeping me in town over the summer. I started to feel more at home in my college town than I did traveling back to the town I grew up in. 

2010, parents were divorced after an ugly couple years, and my mom was on her own for the first time since I was 3 years old. I also found her becoming more and more fascinated with conspiracy theories, and vehemently anti-Obama. This struck me as odd, as she was never so vocal with such hateful rhetoric. I’d grown used to the Fox News parroting, but this was on another level.

After college, I found work in another state on the west coast and moved with my girlfriend and son in 2013. My mom seldom would visit, although I would make it back several times a year.

Fast forward to 2015, and I’m getting very excited about Bernie Sanders, especially because of my moms poor health and her struggles with preexisting conditions and coverage. I called her to ask her what she thought, and was taken back by how enamored she was with Trump. It didn’t make any sense to me, this man was horrible with the things he said in public, and had no real policy from what I could tell. Never the less, my mom did the condescending “oh son” bit and I decided to not get into it. To my absolute horror, Trump won the Presidency. 

My Facebook feed would constantly be filled with hateful fascist rhetoric from my mother and likeminded family. I couldn’t keep quiet. I had to say something, provide them links to facts. Somehow I had to show them they were being fed lies. This only served to disconnect me from them further. I was somehow “indoctrinated” from going to college and daring to read books. 

My mom was now taking my sister to Trump rallies every time he would visit the state. They both wore their MAGA hats, and again to my horror, chanted “Send her back!” In regards to Ilhan Omar, and yelled obscenities at the local media covering the event (which my biological father was a part of and in attendance).

2020 was so bad. The worst. My mother eventually blocked me on Facebook, and started telling family how she was “worried about me being radicalized” behind my back. My mother was immune compromised, had several bouts of chemotherapy, and was a smoker of 35+ years. 

I was paranoid she would get COVID, and sent her a box of 50 bottles of hand sanitizer after furiously refreshing on Amazon for hours. She was proud to not wear a mask when she went out. She even called me one day to vent about how she was “accosted by 3 elderly ladies in Walgreens for not wearing a mask when pickup up my prescriptions”. My mother had Graves’ disease, and was not taking care of herself.

She was absolutely convinced that Trump would be arresting the Democrats and winning the election in a landslide. Except that didn’t happen, and I think it really shocked my mother. The election was called that Saturday after Pennsylvania was projected for Biden. My girlfriend and son were dancing, and it was a truly happy day here.

Two days later, I wake up to a bunch of missed calls from my sister. Mom had died early in the morning that Monday. She had a “thyroid storm” and her body couldn’t take it. I flew over and helped my sisters clean up her apartment, and that’s when I learned how truly bad everything was.

We found her blood pressure monitor, sealed in the box, never used. Empty packs of cigarettes everywhere, even tough she told us she quit years ago. She had a QAnon phone case, a WWG1WGA sweater, and a collection of MAGA hats. I was floored. This had consumed my mother, and all came crashing down.

My sister is even more of an adherent to this QAnon cult since mom passed, and I am truly worried about her. I don’t know what to do, or even if it is worth my time. We are trying to plan a memorial for my mother, and my sister calls me the day after the Capitol riots and vents about how “Antifa stormed the Capitol”.... I told her she is living in a fantasy world and that I can’t deal with her at this time.

I know this was long, and I’m an emotional mess over all of this... does anyone have any recommendations or tips on how to break through to people who are so stuck on this QAnon propaganda?",QAnonCasualties

Nazis needed someone to blame after WWI and a group that was an easy target for them was the Jewish population. Okay, it makes sense, on paper. Disgusting people doing disgusting things, but historically it follows.  


But then you get to QAnon and it's all lizard people, drinking baby blood, some anonymous dude named Q who speaks through riddles and numerology, Trump being some kind of Christian savior despite having more flaws than the antichrist and somehow enough people in a vaguely educated somewhat civilized society to start following this movement like lemmings over the cliffs of insanity.

671,Ex called me just to bitch at me about Trump. Haven't spoken to him since my birthday... when he bitched at me about Trump.,"I have an on-again/off-again friendship with my ex. Mostly, he's always been abusive but when he moved down to Floriduh, he went from being just a jerk to being a jerk who hoards guns obsessively (to the point where he complained when I bought him a ticket to come to Disney with me because he couldn't open carry there, ffs) and has gotten pretty scary. He's miserable, I can tell. Last time I was at his house, he was smoking heavily, talking about how he hated everyone, talking about how he was spending money he didn't have on buying more guns, and eventually tried to kick me out of his house only to beg me to stay when I finally had enough. His neighbor, one of his best friends, basically told me in a private conversation that he was done with him too because as the neighbor put it, ""he's not well"".   


On my birthday in October, he called me to... I guess, wish me Happy Birthday but ended up calling me a demo-drone and demo-rat after I asked him to stop talking about politics TWICE. Eventually, I had to cut him off (which I actually rarely do because I don't have the strength to say no to him usually-- but hey, I think Trump finally killed my last bit of love in my heart for him, so Trump did ONE good thing) and tell him, ""You know, I'm trying to have a happy birthday despite everything being closed... and talking to you is making it really hard to do that... so I'm gonna go... have a happy day... without you. Bye.""  


So I got a voicemail from him this weekend. Telling me Happy New Years' (in February, ffs) and telling me he hopes I'm okay. I tried to call back and hilariously (and because everything always has to be on his terms) it said my number was blocked. I know my FB and email are also blocked. So I sent him this from my new job's email and basically just had this annoying conversation with him:  


ME:(Subject titled: Why?)  What is the point of you leaving voicemails on my phone when you know you have me blocked on your phone? Either show up in my life or don't, but I'm tired of games like this. I tried to call you back only to listen to the recording telling me I'm blocked, so yeah, totally made my day. Thanks. I wish you well and hope you can find happiness somehow, but after what happened in January in Washington DC, I don't consort with terrorists.   


HIM:  Still under the glamour of those scumbags I see, that's why I new it was a mistake responding, oh well. Instead of happiness I wish the truth upon you, don't worry you won't hear from me again.    


ME:  Again, I'm asking you to leave me alone. You scare me. I don't like whoever it is you've turned into with your guns and extremism. We had our issues before, but I don't even know who you are anymore. I don't think I love you like this anymore. I really hope you find happiness out there, but you really scare me right now. I don't care if you don't see it my way, but I'm super serious about it this time. You scare me, you're even angrier than before and I don't trust you like this. I'd like it if you left me alone please. \[Your neighbor\]  told me you're ""not well"" and we both agreed for my own safety that I stay away from you. He was very adamant about it and he seems to know you best. We both agreed you've become violent these past few years and have a paranoia streak going and have become obsessive about guns. I'm afraid of you. I've never been afraid of you before, but I am now and I'm asking you to just leave me alone please. You're not the person I loved. He's gone. I hope you figure out your stuff though. Truly, I do. We've had our differences before, but this is different. I have to stay away from you because I'm afraid you'll hurt me. I'm sorry.   


HIM:  I new it would be a mistake to attempt common curtesy, I didn't send you a rocking chair, you sent it to me. You are a brainwashed fueled by your fear the perfect puppet, a tool to destroy democracy, you cry about inequality but never think that you have set up a world of slaves and inequality. Lies, guilt and fear are all you deal in. I was feeling sorry for you, now I know your lost.  This is the last you will here from me, but some day you will know what a fool you have been and I wish you no mercy in your despair.  As for me, I have no regrets and have found happiness and true love in these dark times. I feel pity for future generations a race of slaves will be born.  PS stop trying to pretend you know anything about me, your warped sense of reality is the most dangerous thing their is, guns are not as dangerous as a bad idea, and you an your cronies have been doing your best at destroying freedom and democracy but like all tyrants your time of judgement shall come.   


ME:  Goodbye \[his name\]. Don't contact me again. I honestly wish you hadn't the first time too. I don't love you anymore. I'm sorry.   


  
It's just.... ugh. I also have this photo of him from years ago that I keep thinking about. A car had gotten into an accident in front of his house because he lived on a busy road. I had my camera in my hand and decided to take some pictures to see if I could help them with insurance, ect. In the photo, everyone is rushing to this flipped car to see if the person is alright, while he's just standing there going through mail he just got out of the mailbox not even looking up. It's just that level of lack of empathy that I really think was there but that Trump and his alt right goons preyed on.

672,How to handle Qanon MIL,"Hello all -

I have reason to believe that my soon to be MIL is q. I have always knows she is conservative but having grown up with conservative family members this seems extreme to me. A few examples are she posts videos claiming that public officials are faking there covid vaccine. She references forces that are causing things in very criptic ways and her FB friends have said she is”awakened” she has also made several comments about how Bill Gates is behind things? I am not sure what that fully means.  Interestingly enough she has also in the past year suddenly become religious (christian) which I find interesting. I grew up Christian so its more so the sudden aspect that really surprises me.

I do not like her and she does not like me. She is an anti-masker and my partner(her son) called her out on it recently and said that they are important. She said basically ”says who” and he listed my parents who are scientists in the medical field. She got very upset and said my parents and I were spreading fake news and basically we are part of the problem. Then called him and screamed that he should break off the engagement because “I lied about being sick” I survived a tumor several years ago that lead to many surgeries which my partner was there for so I would have had to really go to a lot of lengths to make that up.    We agreed we would stop speaking to his mother and focus on our relationship which was good for a few months.

Now I made it very clear I think she is out of her mind but Its his mom and I am not going to stop him from having a relationship so they began talking again. 
A big part of my doesn’t want her at the wedding or in our lives at all. But it sounds like alienating someone who is part of this stuff might not be the best idea? What do you all think? Also does this sound like qanon? Any idea why she thinks my illness is fake would that have anything to do with qanon?",QAnonCasualties
673,&lt;---former conspiracy theorist junkie and I hate Q My mom loves him so we dont talk about it,"My mom Loves trump I think because she likes insulting assholes who dont care what damage they cause to get what they want. she used to watch apprentice and didnt believe in any conspiracy theories untill around 2016, I wouldnt know exactly because I was usually in my room trying to find the truth in books, religions. history, and I would usually be the one to present an odd view or theory no one else wouldve considered cause they are not alone with nothing to do, and they would laugh at me so I felt kind of alone watched alot or scifi, I loved stargate. But when I heard what she was believing IT DROVE ME NUTS  ""Pizzagate, Hillarys a hologram, Trump Is Jesus Christ"" I had come across most of these theorys (the Christ one I had to research...in doing so I found a time travel one I dare not show her because shes already wasting time watching other shit)  I have got into heated arguments with her because I researched trumps history and never liked him. I would argue to her for example: He started A charity the trump fundation that he never gave a cent to and it was shut down for something illegal, but you think hes going to help you She would reply """"and you Believe that???"" and laugh we would argue to the point she would get so mad she would run away rubbing her ears and I screamed and punch a hole in the wall. And  I thought since I used to believe some of the stuff she was saying I could get threw to her. that night we kind of hit a stalemate and we both kind of just dont talk about it anymore, because we know its impossible for one of us to win.  I know she still belives what she does but I dont care. I tried my best and it only seemed to make it worse. im content with this as long as she doesnt repeat the same theory over and over everyday like its going to change my idea. It was rough but I think we finally reached a sort of unspoken agreement on possibly the biggest dissagreement in the world today.- James",QAnonCasualties
674,Bill Gates conspiracy?,"I have a group zoom with 3 siblings every week. One sibling is so into Trump, that he once questioned Bill Gates involvement in vaccines in a FB post. We don’t talk politics in our zoom, especially me, because it would get messy. But does anyone know about this Bill Gates conspiracy? Is it Qanon?",QAnonCasualties
675,Almost Qanon; a discussion on Alternative media brainwashing,"My grandfather seems to have a penchant for supporting leaders with fascistic tendencies, such as his support for both Duterte and Trump in 2016. However, he has since then dropped his support for Duterte, not because he prefers to kill drug abusers instead of, I don't know, offering them rehab, but because he has ""allied himself with communist China."" I believe that not everyone is perfect, but what my grandpa (and the rest of my family) seems to lack in their otherwise unassuming and polite personalities, they make up for in espousing the most outdated and harmful views bordering on conspiracy, hence the ""almost Qanon"" title. I have watched my family change from typical immigrants who get their news from a healthy mix of different news sources to exclusively watching OANN, reading Epoch Times, and watching god knows what on Youtube.

Youtube is a godforsaken website. It has an algorithm notorious for trapping people in ideological echochambers. The emergence of alternative news media seems like a good thing on paper, but these internet news channels aren't obligated to the same amount of fact checking as those on the mainstream media. If you already hold the same ideas as the person spreading the news, there is a good chance that you won't question what they are telling you because you have a confirmation bias. Most of these alternative media sources are free to spread conspiracy theories to an unquestioning audience. The crazier the conspiracy, the more attention it gets.

 The algorithm is also easy to manipulate- people with enough money, who otherwise would never be aired on TV because of the conspiracies that they push, can pay for ads on youtube and mass produce videos at a faster rate. The result of this is channels such as China Uncensored and PragerU, which are gateways to alt-right conspiracy channels such as Stefan Molyneux that push the Jewish Question. I am not white, so I don't need to worry about my family becoming Nazis, but some are at greater risk. 

What's even worse is that when you tell them about this, *they'll accuse you of watching the fake news when they are being fed disinformation day in and day out.* 

These are the consequences of ""doing your own research"". There are traps and pitfalls every step of the way, and these places are just as untrustworthy as ""mainstream media."" There is a point to be made about the media controlling the narrative, but if you really want to know the truth you have to stop relying on these alternative media figures and be open to people challenging things that you have believed your whole life, especially if you are religious, in the case of my grandfather. 

There is also a case to be made about religion. If you were raised to place blind faith in supernatural stories that are hard to prove the happened in real life, there is a great chance you are prone to believing in conspiracies. However, religion is not the great evil itself, it is a tool, like money, those can use to influence others. 

I am worried about my family. Whenever they turn the TV on I can hear the hate that these people preach against the boogeyman ""Left"" and ""Antifa"". What will they think of me? How will they react if I bring a black friend home, or a Mexican friend, knowing that they are regularly racist to these people at home? They have become more bigoted, whether they know it consciously or unconsciously because of these QAnon adjacent theories. I just overhead my uncle talking about the deep state. I had more faith in him, hoping he was apolitical, but no. He is just like everybody else in my family: racist, classist, sexist, and judgmental towards people who live different lifestyles. 

I just wish I had a normal, apolitical family.",QAnonCasualties
676,What happens when Trump is aliven't?,"I mean, the man is no spring chicken and even being rich and with access to top doctors, his diet is garbage and he never exercises. So I doubt he'll live another 20 years. Regardless of how long he makes it, what happens after? From my experience with my QParent, the entire thing hinges on Trump. The reason that so many treat him like a Christ figure is because to them he really is a savior.

My wife is a sociologist who specializes in cults, so I'm not unfamiliar with cults and how they behave after a leader dies, but Q is different. For one, Trump isn't leading Q directly; these are all aspersions they have put on him. I think we can all agree he ran for President for his own ego, nothing more. The QAnons latched on to him because they want to believe that the world is evil and run by Democrat baby-eaters.

So what do they do? The man could keel over tomorrow, and to me its terrifying to think of what sort of unhinged mayhem will come. Undoubtedly they will think he was killed. Do they turn to violence? Come to their senses? Latch onto a new, younger person like a Lauren Boebert?",QAnonCasualties
677,Some suggestions?,"I read an article where a woman was going to have her mother committed and then she read up on this Q Anon and decided she wasn’t insane and that it’s Q Anon. Actually it’s both . Have you thought about having your loved one involuntary committed? I think they can be held against their will for 3 days. And that’s 3 days without Q in their lives. How they respond (withdrawal symptoms?) might give you more answers to the complexities of the illness. Can they be videotaped and shown the video once they get back home?

IMHO, people fall into fantasy when something in reality is too untenable for them. Figure out what that is. 

And as they say in al-Anon people change when it becomes too uncomfortable not to. What would provide them with maximum discomfort? 

Who is in ultimate charge of their devices? Change the WIFI password to one they aren’t given, suspend their cell phone, parental block Fox News, OAN and Newsmax. Take cash and cards so they can’t sneak out and purchase a burner phone. All this can be done and they will likely go frantic ... withstand! And remember to take radios out of the house.

678,I Guess it is Goodbye...,"I suppose it shouldn't have been a horrifying shock that my mother would have fallen into such ""Q"" ridiculousness, eventually.

I first became aware that something was somewhat off as a child — when my mother was dragging her then five children to see 'healing revivals' attended by thousands, 'Christian' concerts, where people swayed in trancelike fixation, both hands towards heaven, speaking gibberish, or even at times — contorting on the ground like a fish out of water desperate for life.

It concerned me that people were not self-conscious, or even feeling a little absurd behaving that way in public, or worse, in private — seemingly for the satisfaction-or-amusements of other like-minded individuals — or the people who supposed to lead them.

Growing older, it got more ludicrous and more extreme — although now inside of these buildings, Pat Robertson, Billy Graham, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, and others. They were making wild claims, insisting that Jesus was returning imminently — and that we were in the 'end times.' They made tens of millions from exploiting the fears and devotion of these people.

Ridiculous numbers of people were going broke. Her three oldest (12, 14, and 15) would ask my father (who wouldn't attend) what would happen if our mother left us there. She constantly threatened to leave us with other 'Charismatic Christian' family counselors to drive the evil and lust for sin out of us.

I was forced into parochial schools. Not Catholic, or Jewish (which is what I am, we are), but evangelical, charismatic Christian institutions — who believed in corporal punishment, humiliation, and wild racism. They groomed the young males into Christian misogyny with a drumbeat of 'women stand behind their husbands, and support them, not beside them.' You would hear girls (prepubescent) talking about how they will be a Proverbs 31 woman. Those women are the modern ""Q"" movement; they were children during this movement.

Luckily, I escaped through academia. State testing and the not yet pervasive homeschooling movement were luckily at odds — the state discovered that not only should I, but I could rapidly accelerate my education, graduating from high school just shy of my 15th birthday.

My sisters didn't fare so well — because they were, after all, girls. In their way, each one escaped, educated, and became independently successful. They found husbands, and in some cases, left them. They found careers, and each has been thriving.

The above preamble illustrates that these people have existed (those susceptible to these kinds of cults and radicalizing religious groups) within the US, pervasively, since its inception.

In 2017, everything changed. I would describe a person I would define as a religious fanatic and disciplined Christian who became unhinged, cruel, hateful, overtly racist — dismissive, xenophobic, and believe it or not — a Holocaust denier. My bubbie (mum's mum) was a Holocaust survivor who lived to 102, the only survivor of 12 children from Birkenau concentration camp. My mother denied the genocide of our entire family (my maternal grandmother was the only survivor on that side of the family) by hateful, racist misinformation — propagated by 'Fake News' reinforced by irresponsible platforms like Facebook and Fox, and made ever-present by the society unraveling platform of Twitter.

In 11 months, my mother went from a harmlessly gullible grandmother and great-grandmother — to a raging racist, misogynistic crazy person, who believed in unhinged, untethered realities that assailed our ethnicity, our faith, and our sanity.

She began abusing my father, accusing him of being a pedophile, a sheep, brainwashed, and most importantly, ""The Deceived."" My father is in his late 70s, has dementia advancing, and cannot live unsupervised. She would withhold food, leave him in the bedroom for days, humiliated him in public, leave him at bus stops for hours why she ran errands — and came back to screaming insults and threats to abandon him at a VA home.

I removed my father from the house and placed him in assisted living just a short ride away from the grandchildren.

In 2018, my brother, then in his late 30s, was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer — and he deteriorated-and-died within 11 months.

During that time, we confronted many things — not the least of which is that my only brother was adopted in the 70s by our family, is mixed race, and came out as gay shortly after graduating college. Of course, when he came out, my mother told all sorts of stories to herself about how he may have those feelings, but never acted on them, and therefore, will most likely receive salvation — especially, if she can get him to admit that his lifestyle is disgusting, a choice and that he repents.

After about ten years, she gave up on those designs — and wouldn't speak of it, but was never cruel upsetting, or anything other than his mother. That is, until 2018.

Before I placed my brother in hospice, I brought the family together to explain my decision. We were all cornered-and-lectured by my mother, with a crazed look in her eye and an unhinged tone in her voice, that her youngest son was the victim of a pedophile ring (in the 70s) and that she rescued him, and that the brainwashing that he received between the ages of newborn and 3 1/2 years old have been 'triggered' by ""The Awakening"" because the 5G towers surrounding the large city in which they live — gave him cancer, and that dying gay, was G-d's retribution on his sinful life, if not for Democrats, Republicans would not permit his lifestyle. He would've both lived and known salvation.

Her five surviving children, 15 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren have not seen her since his funeral. COVID, of course, is a hoax. She refuses to wear a mask — and, therefore, cannot be around any of her children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.

Her ""Q"" friends warned her that the masks were a liberal plot to separate her generation from all previous generations so that the cabal — will not be challenged when the 144k children per year are ritualistically sacrificed, and then — I don't know, their blood is collected for some laughable word, that sounds as though Jim Henson wrote it into the plot of a Muppet movie.

The above is not an uneducated woman. She is not an isolated woman. This woman is not a poorly traveled, poorly read, or a poorly educated human being. This is an individual who speaks three languages, including English; got both a Bachelors and Masters of fine arts in performance on three instruments. An artist, writer, curious person with a quirky, often misguided allegiance towards religious dogma and devotion to a creator that she can neither see nor hear (audibly.)

I fear, if we dismiss, ignore, or ridicule these people more deeply — we'll turn a belief and cause into a religion, lifestyle, and dogma that will be unshakable. Our country is not without precedent. Even Ronald Reagan was taken in by a cultlike conspiratorial group early in his career. People cared enough about him — to sternly pull him away and make him realize that the fringes he was toying with would ultimately have him dismissed, debunked, and left off the playing field. Luckily, his ambition for power far exceeded his need for sycophantish praise from people on the margins of society.

I needed to share this — I'm not sure where it'll go, I don't know what to do, and I don't believe I will ever have a meaningful relationship with my mother again.

I suppose I'm either looking for support-and-permission to abandon the woman who gave me life so that I might save my own — or hope that there is a way to de-radicalize, deprogram, and get back the eccentric, quirky, brilliant woman — who was odd, but not insane.",QAnonCasualties

Hi,

We  are creative writers working on an electronic storytelling project  relevant to this sub. Our goal is not just to record the stories of  broken relationships but also to serve as a catalyst and platform for  mending those relationships.

Would  you like to try a gentle, non-confrontational way to reach your family  member or friend lost to Q? We are working on an electronic literature  piece to tell up to 20 stories about relationships that broke, due in  part to trusting in different information sources and thus developing  diverging political beliefs.

You  could invite your lost-to-Q loved one  to contribute, or you can  contribute your own story and send that to your loved one. This could be  a way to reach out and mend relationships.

Take our survey at  [https://infocue.surveysparrow.com/s/InfoCUE-Information-Creating-Understanding-and-Empathy/tt-c562ef](https://infocue.surveysparrow.com/s/InfoCUE-Information-Creating-Understanding-and-Empathy/tt-c562ef).  You can answer the questions yourself without your friend or family  member, or you can invite your friend or family member to answer them  jointly with you.  We will send your answers back to you in a form you  can share if you wish.  We will use the responses in a forthcoming  electronic literature piece, which will provide links within each story  to show how people have grown apart in this divisive era of battling  information sources. While some or all of your story may be used, we  will not use your name or any identifying information.

683,Friend of 15 Years - Rant/Vent,"Thinking about the conversation my friend and I had in the summer of 2020 gives me a really nasty feeling. Reading a lot of these stories posted, that nasty feeling inside is enhanced because I notice striking similarities. The symptoms of someone falling down the Q-hole sometimes seem identical - the reactions, the hate, etc. 

She was my first friend when I moved in 6th grade (I’m 27 now, for reference). My parents were so happy I found a friend who 1) I liked 2) had been surrounded by “like” morals. 

Some background - we had just moved from a very religious, non-diverse (very white), low-income area. These points alone are not the issues, it was the parent’s and rhetoric of our neighbor’s that my parents were uncomfortable with. Friend’s parents would sneak bibles in my backpack, friends would make me cry in 2nd grade because my parents didn’t take us to church and I was going to hell, my parents worried about my sister and I at our friends’ for dinner because they knew we’d have to awkwardly pray. 

She was my first friend in my new town, her parents were pro-choice, separation of church and state, etc. What was great was finding people who didn’t allow their religious beliefs to blanket the country’s politics, even more so, people who had an aligned religious view. We felt like yay! We found our people. 

Even in my new town, our liberal views were not the norm, but we were surrounded by a different type of conservative view than in our previous hometown, or at least less “in your face”. 

My friend and I remained best friends throughout middle school, thru high school, and even tho different colleges we were close throughout those years as well. Post-grad we had our first official rift (2019 ish). It’s over things non-Q related so I won’t go into that - just different phases of our lives got in the way of being able to relate to each other. 

We keep afloat because by this time she is a new mom, and I want to be there for her and her new family. Just because I couldn’t relate didn’t mean I couldn’t be the cool aunt, help out from time to time, and just all around be there as a sense of normalcy outside of new parenthood etc. 

COVID hits and she’s hating on our state’s governor (who gets hated on by Trump and Trumper’s constantly). This was surprising to me, I truly didn’t expect her reaction to the governor’s shut down to be so short sighted? I expected some logical backboard in her frustration. 

BLM protests and presentations begin, maybe the first “major round” in summer 2020. A protest in a city across the state had minimal destruction done, she FREAKS out, calls them riots, is OUTRAGED at all the property damage....? But she called them riots. I challenged that, only to get immediate snark from her and another friend in our group chat. 

Then the suicide of that Isaac person happened, I had seen it on Twitter, not knowing at the time it had bases in Q conspiracy, I didn’t know what Q was at the time, I took note of the Twitter thread, thinking dang that’s wild &amp; probably untrue, but I might want to go back and read it later. 

Without having the chance to, she brings it up. I respond that I saw that, what was it? She sends me a 45 minute long video about Hillary Clinton trafficking kids from Haiti. Goes on about Monster’s Inc. being true only it’s The Elite taking screams from children to create adreochrome. I ask her, what about everything with Epstein and Trump, those rape accusations? She goes, I don’t know, I just know I Hate Hillary Clinton, and she’s an AWFUL human being who should burn in hell. Like so ANGRY. I was nervous texting about it, because everything I questioned she had a rebuttal for but it was often intimidating and aggressive. Like if I didn’t believe it... I’m completely out of my mind..?!

I asked her if she really thought this was true, it was sounding “pizza-gatey” and “but the emails”. She said, “that’s the thing - when I first saw pizzagate I thought it was bullshit, I believe it now”. She starts on other topics about how the BLM protests are being funded by democrats as a hoax. This was all really fucking sad. I haven’t brought up anything to her since, and neither has she. We’ve seen each other and talked just fine, but in the back of my mind I just do not like her anymore. I’m not sure if she is still believing everything, or where she stands with it. I don’t even want to touch the conversation with a ten foot pole. I would like to think after all the debunking she no longer invests in the conspiracy, but I don’t know. She doesn’t post, she just reads and absorbs. 

Her calling the BLM protests “riots” was enough for me to be super upset, but everything else on top of that it’s like, who is this person? 

Thanks for letting me vent, feel free to share your story in the comments.

695,feeling guilty for not liking my Q parent ( rant ),"So, my mum is really into conspiracy theories and it has gradually escalated. Now she seems to be into some QAnon things, not believing all of it but it still concerns me. She's more open about her opinions and beliefs now, which is unfortunate. My dad isn't very into them, he watches them when she does at times, and i'm sure he isn't as extreme in his opinions.

She is a good mother in most aspects. She does a lot for me, is usually kind and caring. However, I just.. don't like her still ? I really try to, I think about how caring she is and how good she can be. I just can't get past the blatant racism, homophobia, transphobia and general disregard for others ( anti-vax, anti-masks etc. ). It hurts, because underneath it, I think she is kind and wouldn't hurt anyone. Yet clearly she can hurt people, so much. It hurts to know she can disregard science, our health and safety, as well as respect for others.

I got into an argument with her as she overheard me getting to a breaking point over these things. I was in pain that day regardless and I felt ill, and I just couldn't take it. I ranted to my brother about how I feel that's all she does all day - watch things that affirm these beliefs. She was really angry, calling me ungrateful and not letting me even apologise for what I said no matter how hard I tried to. She thinks she knows what I ""really"" think of her now. 

I don't think that badly of her, but I couldn't even express that It bothered me as I was shut down. Apparently I can't tell her what to believe or watch. Which is right of her to say, I can't do that. Yet it hurts to see my mother who i saw as kind and loving, turn into someone who could just easily say something racist, or praise a president who caused so much hurt and despair. I mean, she definetly hasn't been the nicest all the time, but I try not to think of that mistreatment, as I don't want to seem ungrateful.

The worst thing is i'm just full of guilt, I feel sick. I said some rude things I didn't mean. I have bad anxiety to begin with and I feel like i'm falling apart. She kept saying how she dislikes the way I act most of the times and the things I like, which also hurt a lot. She has always been enthusiastic about the things I enjoy previously.

I don't know if i'm a bad person for disliking her, or kind of losing it earlier. Due to her care she gives me I feel that I can't dislike her. I'm made to feel ungrateful if I critizise her for anything. 

I don't know if this guilt is common or not ? Please let me know if you have experienced something similar. I'm sorry for the long rant, i'm really not doing well with this.

There have been anti Semitic theories of deep state-style cabals for centuries. The fake document known as The Protocols of The Elders of Zion was like this, claiming that Jews were part of a cabal to control the government and the world.

But perhaps the most startling is the nearly word for word similarity to the Pizzagate insanity. For centuries, there has been anti Semitic conspiracies in some parts of the world that Jews kidnap non-Jewish children and eat them in order to perform rituals and stay young. Sometimes these theories mention molestation. Of course, most sane people can hear this and realize how anti Semitic and ridiculous it is, but the Pizzagate theory is almost word for word the same and all these people fall for it. Not to mention it just replaces the word “Jews” with synonyms like “Hollywood Elites” or “rich globalists like George Soros”.

I knew that what she was immersing herself in was very right wing, pro-Trump, pro-Patriot, but I never could have imagined that she would espouse QAnon. On the way to her COVID vaccination appointment (which I forced her into), she launched into a disturbing story. She began enthusiastically telling me how JFK Jr. has been alive all this time  (and his wife and sister-in-law) and he will be coming out in public in the next two weeks. I could not believe what I was hearing. I calmly asked her to explain further. She said that in the late 90’s the Clintons were worried that JFK Jr posed a threat to Hilary’s political chances in the Senate so they plotted to take Jr. out by putting a bomb in his plane. But...intelligence found out about the plot and instead of Jr, his wife and sister-in-law getting on the plane, they were put into hiding. Meanwhile, another pilot flew Jr’s plane that fateful day and ejected himself just before it blew up. This was all top secret. Jr, his wife, and sister-in-law have been kept in protective hiding for all of these years—except for the occasional event that Jr would go to in disguise (like Trump’s Inauguration).  When Jr comes out to the public in two weeks, he plans to expose the Clintons and gave them arrested for their plot to kill him. Then he will join forces with his “good friend” Donald Trump and he’ll him expose all the members of the Deep State who are pedophiles and sacrifice babies for their blood. I am beyond dumbfounded. Just speechless.  When I tried to talk with Mom and bring her back to reality, she just kept shaking her head and saying that I just don’t know.

My son..who is in his mid 50’s is smart..hard working..compassionate..funny..easy-going..generous person..he has been taken over by gradual Trump-ism morphed into Q-ism.  He is now angry and passionate about a lot.    
I first tried to challenge his thinking/beliefs..gently (mostly) but sometimes not so gently (which I now regret).

712,"A little history, explanation, and my 2 Q friends.","A little history, explanation, and my ex-Q friend.

So I have two friends who fell into the Q reality (Just ‘q-land” from now on). One is still in it; the other is back into reality, our real, shared normal reality.

BTW- for those interested, The Qanon/embrace of the tRump movement can be traced from 4chan, back through “something awful’ a website of the 2000’s then back to Japan’s economic crash of the 90’s. (ie QAnon-Anon podcast ep 128).  

First, we are not, or rather were not, in an age of unique increased conspiracy thinkers (as of 2014 anyway) While there have been spikes, the level of conspiracy theorists in the country usually returns to a baseline, or has since WWII. (See Suspicious MInds: Why We Believe Conspiracy Theories by Rob Brotherton. So why the spike of Q? It’s a perfect storm, so to speak:

-The growth of the internet and social media. Information sources have grown almost exponentially since the internet started. The world is more complex. This makes people afraid, less certain of their world. It is harder to be sure of things, hence harder to make sense of the world with so many competing sources od explanatrion, the ground is shaky so to speak. People seek comfort through explanations, and for some, the simpler the better.  

-The effect of “Chan” memes, etc:  4Chan, etc. members’ point of being is to ridicule popular culture by blowing it up from within, so to speak. Undermine it by popularizing things that undercut baselines and reality. Promoting tRump was one such act. 4Channers KNEW tRump’s horrible financial history, his faults, that he’d most likely be a horrible leader, but they promoted him because 1)it was a bad joke to play on everyone else (who had jobs, families, etc) and 2) he was, in a way, like them; willing to break norms. 

-Covid/time: A component of growth in q-land adherents has to do with so many people having had extra time on their hands to browse YouTube and other echo chambers via lockdowns, layoffs, closed restaurants, movies, etc. 

-Covid/financial: Most people who stormed the capital had some kind of recent financial setback/difficulty. This is, of course, not true of many q-landers, just some of the most extreme, but the base that grew it into a critical level needed for respectability, a tipping point that gave it some validity to where others were drawn into it, were by and large, under/unemployed 4channers and other “channers”.  People in these communities needed to spend vast amounts of time participating to be accepted hence they were people with no, or low paying, jobs, people with loads of extra time with no spouses or families or interests except 4chan, etc, who demanded their time.  Busy people with active jobs and interests and families were just non-existent on early 4-chan communities that started to promote tRump as a joke to foist upon everyone else.

-The grifters:  Facebook/YouTube/etc. ; Once it had grown large enough, the grifters moved in.  Youtube and Facebook, etc. allowed ‘influencers’ to monetize’ q-land with their videos and Facebook groups seeking donations. 

 -There is no one Q doctrine. It is flexible; people can apply whatever parts they want to their specific belief system, and its holes. So many voices, so many things to pick and choose from.

 -It starts with little things that have a grain of truth. I.e. Alex Jones claims scientists are making human/animal hybrids. If you look it up, you see he is technically correct in a very, very small way, but 1) they are not growing chimeras and 2) that is the kind of thing (gene splicing, etc.) that science DOES, they push boundaries. Yet some don’t make that distinction, and say “hey, Alex is kinda right, what else does he have to say?”  Or: Child trafficking goes from generic child sexual abuse to adrenochrome seeking  baby-killers in a public pizza parlor by national figures over the course of 20 videos watched.

-So, there is no typical Q-lander, although there are a few traits that seem to make people more susceptible (ie younger males who feel disenfranchised, no power), conservatives (who show higher fear response in brain scans when faced with unknown/uncertain change, hence high gun ownership, fear of immigrants), people previously attracted to other ‘isms’ (even liberal new-age-isms, ie people who might bite at the child trafficking part of q only to start believing the adrenochrome storyline), people who have a predilection for authoritarianism (more toward trump supporting parts of Qanon).  See Suspicious Minds, Brotherton, CH1 for a more specifics about people who may be predisposed to conspiracy theories.  A number of theories abound, I doubt there is one set of driving traits.

Mix those things in (and I’m sure I missed a bunch) with the following: confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance, and you have people who you CANNOT logically talk away from q-land.

Confirmation bias is when we are told/shown we are wrong but we double down, and start cherry-picking only information that confirms our ideas, and rejecting other data. This is where the rejection of ‘lame stream media’ and ‘you’ve been brainwashed’ and “sheeple” come in. The harder one pushes, the harder the believer digs in and reaffirms their own position.

It’s like a drug: as with most drugs the high/other feelings of validation/security/etc start to seem insufficient, so they spend more time on the internet, and start believing more &amp; more outlandish things to both give them the ‘conspiracy high’ and fight off the effects of cognitive dissonance.

 Cognitive Dissonance:  (Read “A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance”, by Leon Festinger. This is the original thesis for C.D.)  At some level, people KNOW that what they believe does not jive with reality, or at least they are presented with evidence of it.  The predictions fail, counter evidence is presented, etc., so people have to do SOMETHING with that internal conflict, deal with it somehow. Anger at family members, not only for challenging their belief system, but, eventually, for not joining in. Another example is when q predictions fail they often deal with the cognitive dissonance with “Well, it was worth it because we made great friends, we’re still a special group” (said one popular QAnon YouTube grifter to his adherents when the military takeover failed at the inauguration, and he decided to move on to other things, leaving his flock stranded) and they move on to other things to seek the same camaraderie.

Per my friend who was a q-lander, attempts to logically dispel their beliefs were useless. Absolutely pointless, in fact, they can be harmful as they drive the other person further away. They still chuckle when I ask why I couldn’t talk them out of it. “You don’t get it, NOTHING you could have said would change my mind, ESPECIALLY if I thought you were on the other side politically. Nothing.  He said it was not like telling a drug user that drugs were bad, it was more like telling a drug user that drugs don’t make you feel good. (The analogy is off, I know, except for the pointlessness &amp; futility it expresses). They came to the realization themselves. It is as simple as that.

There are organizations that deal with teenagers, fairly successfully.  However you cannot take an adult’s internet away against their will, make them attend counseling, and detox them from Qanon without their permission.

Finally, maybe, hopefully, for whatever reason(s); social isolation, job loss, loss of friends, family, the failure of one too many predictions, or the inability to overcome the ever growing cognitive dissonance and finally see things as they actually are, your friend/family member/spouse/etc might want to come back to reality. My friend experienced EXTREME feelings of shame, guilt, self-loathing and, most importantly, feelings that they didn’t think they would be accepted or welcomed back by family and friends. They were extremely surprised when the reaction was not hate and ridicule, but “welcome back, we missed you”. 

The other friends is, unfortunately, long gone into Q. The door is open, they know that, but no Q allowed.",QAnonCasualties
713,It’s really important you all vote.,"I read the sub every day. I am so heartbroken for all of you out there suffering from broken marriages, broken parents, broken friendships because of the Q cult. I think like many observers, I thought Q fever might break after January 20–at least to some extent. 

Obviously it hasn’t.

So I want to stress something to all of you: it is very, very, very important that you vote for organizations or candidates who give no quarter to Q. Yes, I know implicitly this means I’m saying “Vote Democrat.” 

Let me say I’m not a registered Democrat and have supported both Democrats and Republicans. 

Right now, Republicans don’t know what to do with Q. At the state level, they are embracing it; at the federal level, some are enamored with it while others are disgusted. Conservative *political operators* are lining up behind it, however. You see Q implications all over content from conservative social media influencers, bloggers, podcasts, etc. Even Tim Tebow is now obsessed with saving children from human trafficking (a noble cause but largely ignorant that most victims of human trafficking are adult women, and often prosecuted for sex crimes. Sorry Tim, it’s Qbait).

Cults like these aren’t really just cults. They are chaos operations, meant to disrupt the dynamic of elections and divide us so bad actors can seize power in the vacuum. If principled Republicans form a third party, it is more likely conservative/moderate Democrats will be the voters drawn to it than Republicans, who typically vote party lines more rigidly and are rejecting facts at an astonishing rate. 

Families of those who suffered from Q craziness could make the difference here. Before all this, some (not all) of you voted with your parents, your husbands and wives, your siblings and friends. It’s not enough to break ties—we must prevent this group from taking any form of power or control over the actual levers of our government. 

If we do not, we all know they will create a self-fulfilling prophesy. They will round up everyone they are already convinced is guilty. They will engage in violence to “prevent violence.” They will gaslight us all into living in their reality. It’s so essential we all do our part to block this group or any that supports or implicitly accepts its thinking from power. 

We can see the writing on the wall. Republicans are probably not going to divide; Q will remain a faction to be dealt with. The best way to do that is keep them on the fringe where they belong.",QAnonCasualties

The first point of contention with my Mom was the election. Based on simple math: (Number of registered voters in America × percentage of Democrats + percentage of Left Leaning Independents × voter turnout rate) gives you almost exactly how many votes Biden got.
However, my Mom was fully with Trump. That Trump won by a landslide and that there was actually MASSIVE fraud. Now, fraud is not impossible, but I do not believe there would have been enough to sway the result of the election.

So I had become disenchanted with Trump and really only kept a glimmer of faith in him because the Republican Party still supported our Law Enforcement.


Now for the next couple of months, the theories and stuff that my Mom was viewing was getting crazier and crazier. She eventually got hooked to this theory that there was going to be a huge reckoning on Inauguration Day.


I obviously took objection to this ludicrous theory. However, she slammed me with something that pissed me off so bad at could barely even finish my argument, which is uncharacteristic of me as people note I have good control over my emotions. She said ""You're becoming Liberal as fuck and it's scaring me!""
The fact she threw that at me, just because I was trying to get her back on track... I didn't know what to say and I still don't, and that was over a month ago.


Then the final glimmers of hope I had were crushed with the siege on the Capitol. Seeing a bunch of Trump supporters clashing with those Police Officers at the barricade. Calling those poor officers Traitors for doing their job. This was an enormous backstab, and days later I changed my Political Party Affiliation to Independent/None.


""But it was actually Antifa!"" She says. The sad part is that I don't know if she truly believes that or couldn't accept reality. She did condemn the attack itself on the Capitol, but I don't know who she thinks the perpetrators were.


Then comes Inauguration Day, and lo and behold, the Reckoning was bupkis. She called off work to see what was going to happen, and she would up crying all day while watching the TV. Now I don't know if the root of these tears is sheer panic and that ""America is going to end"" or if she realized that I was right and she was lied to.


She's been quieter about her beliefs since. Now nobody in my household is a big fan of Biden or Harris, but I can say with certainty that I am just not a fan of either side right now. The saddest thing of all is that I have to say ""sides"" as people forget that we are all AMERICANS and that we all live under the same stars and stripes.


I am not sure if she is still stuck in QAnon ideals or not. Only time will tell. If you read this whole thing, thank you, God Bless You, and God Bless America.",QAnonCasualties
715,Some advice that might help,"Here’s some advice for anyone to use if they want it. A tactic I use to try to make the people around me realize how ridiculous they sound when talking about Q in hopes that they come to their senses is a pretty simple one: basic follow up questions. 

“How?”

“When?”

“Can you explain why...”

“Why is it that only now...”

“What about these people Trump appointed who did not do that?”

“Name a couple examples”

“So why didn’t X happen instead?”

“When was the last time it actually came true?”

“Where did you hear that again?”

Trust me it does have an effect. Don’t mock them when you ask it, just let them try to answer it and they kind of realize after a while that they can’t really give a coherent reason. It’s not a sure fire 100% works-every-time thing, but it does help to a degree for some people.",QAnonCasualties
716,No q anon in Colombia except for a close friend. Now his family is suffering.,"Background: late 90s, back in architecture school i Made good Friends with a funny friend. Good student, good at sports , good with the ladies.  He would drink a bit too much but he kept it under control.

Then in 2000 his dad went bankrupt , he had to quit school and he flew to Miami , where he could work and study. It was hard ,he went from a rich kid to working class inmigrant.  Yet , he managed to become a successful architect in florida.   He worked at successful firms but he realized he had to quit alcohol. He had a baby on the way, We were all happy.    Then he ""woke"". His kid was supose to bring joy , yet he decided that work was slavery , he dropped out of his successful career.  He would fight with his wife all the time about vaccines and the cancer treatment of a relative of hers.   She put up with him as a drunk for 8 years , but as a ""woke"" morally superior being ,she could only stand him 3 months.  A judge blocked him from seeing his daughter. He told us what he was about to Say in court and we read in horror. His lawyer ditched him.
 
He ended up living in a van , with money he Made by selling ""woke"" courses he created online and with money his sister would send him. ( She is a very successful advertising executive in México).

Enter q anon.  His watsap messages got Even worse.  Our university WhatsApp group was flooded every day by his pro Trump rants.  ( Brown skinned , colombian , yet...Trump supporter).  Since most of us tryed to talk some sense into him he cut contact with us.

His sister stopped sending him money , so he came back to Colombia to his parents house.  A beautiful country house he had built when he was sane.  His rants got louder and crazier.   His dad , a former alcoholic who had been sobber for decades , got back to the bottle.  His mother just begun with Alzheimer's. Every once in a while  she remembers her bright son got sucked into this cult and she cries painfully.    

His sister , took advantage of the chance of working from Home and moved back to the country house too.  Yet ,she is going insane.  She gets to see his brother in his room all day with his conspiracy theories , her father drinking himself to sleep and her Mom having the same sad thoughts every day for the first time.  She knows she might have to quit her career to take care of the rest.   

The good news , q anon has been comoletely rejected here.  Yes , a few antivaxers , soros and Gates gatera, but  as of now , most people tells them to shut up.

But as a friend , i wish i knew what to Say to him?  I know he went crazy before q anon , but it would be great if at least i could motivate him to find work.",QAnonCasualties
717,Another outburst,"I’ve posted before about my wife who holds a shifting slate of Q/ Trumpy beliefs, developed over the past year or so. We’ve had some pretty heated debates, but with the help of this community, friends, and reading up on strategies to deal with cult/Q followers, I’ve adopted a policy of avoidance, gentle pushback, and refusal to engage, while I admittedly continue to try and wait this thing out. I’m still on the fence about what to ultimately do; it’s unbelievably difficult to watch your spouse become a different, angrier person.

Things have been a little calmer for the last couple weeks, but Friday night turned into another shouting match. It’s the most ridiculous things that set her off and it seems that everything agitates her and has that potential.

We sit down as a family to watch tv, she sees something about Disney, launches right into Gina Carano and cancel culture (anyone else notice these culture war headlines setting people off?). I pushed back gently, tried to say I don’t agree with firing everybody for what they post, but you need to judge case to case objectively, and Gina Carano posted some really vile stuff that fans reacted to. Well it didn’t really matter, she was off and running.

Cancel culture, the election was stolen, the Keystone pipeline, China, on and on. I argued back but tried to stay calm as she screamed at me. Began nodding and saying “yeah, sure, absolutely,” at the crazier stuff, which infuriates her.

I lost it when she got to transgenders taking over the country and how they’re going to go into the locker room and rape our daughter (17, sitting in the room, remaining remarkably, admirably calm). I jumped up and said “You are out of your mind!” She continued screaming at me about abortion and how she (my wife) and all the other conservatives are going to be put in jail. So I withdrew again, went back to sarcastically agreeing. She stormed off, went to bed, left the house early Saturday morning and texted me Saturday evening to say she was staying over at her mom’s. I said great, have a good time.

She came back midday yesterday, Sunday, and tried her best to act like everything was normal. I played along because I just don’t have the energy and I’m sticking to the gameplan. We went out to dinner (were supposed to go Saturday for Valentine’s/my birthday - yeah, she casually trashed my birthday). We had a pleasant enough dinner. She told me that the vaccine is causing tons of miscarriages. I said no, I have not heard that. Moved on.

Anyway... thoughts? All this triggered by a grievance relating to the firing of an actress whose name she didn’t know until that day. Tragic, I’d say.",QAnonCasualties
719,Sometimes people may just be too far gone.,"I've been dealing with a conspiracy theory father for almost my entire life. He's spent 20 years in the air force and is now retired.  We live minutes outside of US Strattcom as he's an independent contractor and genuinely one of the smartest people I know when it comes to linux and windows systems.

He's also been a rampant conspiracy theorist for all of my life and, as much as I've tried for 11 years to get him to put his head out of them, I don't believe I ever will. It's worse because he's also gotten to my sisters and my extended family who, fortunately enough, take him at surface value. 

Something that I don't think I'll ever get rid of and made sure to keep is a bottle of Infowars Brain Force Plus pills he bought in 2017 because, after talking with him and picking his brain on the matter, he's been following most conspiracy theories since he retired in 2004. The first time that I had heard anything about ""The illuminati"" would've been around 2008 when I was playing a game and he pointed out the architecture that ""resembled a masonic temple."" 

I wish I had more to say but even after years of just talking to him about it, the reality of the situation is that he never really was a father to me until we were both adults and I tried my best to reasonably walk him out of the events that have been going on. I had saw that he had ""QAnon drops"" in his youtube search feed and instantly started looking into it back in October to prep for getting him out of it. I've been able to mostly but it doesn't change the fact that most of his views are heavily right leaning, going along with the ""Big Tech is censoring everybody who doesn't give into groupthink because the NWO is trying to cause a civil war in America to get rid of guns forever"" crowd, and I don't think that I'll ever be able to see him as anyone more than a man who fell to dillusions his entire time of knowing me.

I'm 21 and I can think for myself, so I'm pushing myself to get out of the country honestly and probably head out to Canada to be away from my family and to just be away from them all. It sucks because I'm giving up really good job opportunities but just being an independent adult and away from it all sounds like stepping out of a hell I've been in all my life.

720,Lost my brother,"So my brother married a pretty toxic woman a few years ago and I have avoided her wrath until this past fall. She had posted something on Facebook about watching your children bc pedophiles are everywhere. I was super confused and commented on the post to which she replied “pizza gate”. I had never heard of any of this crap so I googled it. Once I saw that it was a debunked conspiracy I told her that (in my naïveté I legit thought she would be like ‘oh my gosh, thanks!’). Well you all probably know what happened next. Her and her friends began an all out attack on me via social media.  My brother probably loosely believes this stuff too but has to back his wife. So that’s it. I have only seen him once since November. Haven’t seen my niece or nephew and had to do separate Christmas’s with my parents.  This is my choice. I believe that they both owe me an apology but I know I will never get one. I refuse to act like nothing happened. I guess I’m being stubborn, but I feel like I would be enabling them otherwise.

724,Is Q More Powerful Than Love?,"I figured it was time for a brief introduction, since I've input to several discussions already.

I am a 55-year-old retired Air Force intelligence analyst, currently working as a civilian in the US Intel community. At age 49, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Four months later, my wife of 18 years left me, taking my daughter with her.   


I hit rock bottom that summer, but friends pulled me out of it, and I started the convoluted game of dating in your fifties. After a couple of years of striking out, I finally met the woman of my dreams. Smart. Strong-willed, but vulnerable. Honest and caring. Well-traveled, with lots of experience. And like me, a ""conservative democrat"" or a ""liberal Republican."" A year later, we were engaged, and I found happiness again.

About a year go, her father died, and due to COVID restrictions, she couldn't go to his funeral, and had no closure. That's when one of her brothers started feeding her QAnon information. Almost overnight she went from that moderate political stance to an extreme far-right stance. She referred to Trump as ""the hand of God"" or the ""second coming"" and, well, you're all familiar with the deep state, Bill-Gates and the vaccines, aliens, angels, JFK Jr is alive, plan-demic and other theories this group shoves down their throats. It started forming a wedge between us, as she often sees me as an enemy now, someone who shoots down everything she finds important. In the last two months, she has twice broken off our engagement, and last night accused me of being with her in an attempt to steal her house from her.   


I should probably just give up and walk away, but I can't. She's been with me through so much, even helping me following hip replacement surgery, allowing me to stay with her for ten days of healing. I love her with all my heart, and I know she's still in there somewhere, under all that hostility and anger. So I am hiring a renowned exit counselor who has pulled MANY people out of cults in the past. It's going to cost me an arm and a leg, but if I can get her back, it'll all be worth it.

725,QAnon in Iran??,"I’m an Iranian-American college student who goes to a pretty liberal school. I have not seen a single Q follower among my friends here. BUT what is insanely absurd is the fact that Qanon and Trump have found a relatively large following in Iran, a country that was hit very hard by Trump imposed sanctions. Just to be clear, a large number of people who are currently hurting badly as a result of Trump’s sanctions believe the democrats stole the election, and are secretly working with the Mullahs in power in Iran because they are evil or whatever. I grew up and went to high school in Iran but I have had to cut my relations with a number of my high school friends because they started sending me posts about Q and Iranian versions of the same conspiracy theories. I know my story is not as traumatic as many of the stories here about ppl losing their loved ones, but I think it’s interesting how these crazy conspiracies have made their way into a society so far away from the US.",QAnonCasualties
726,Hoping for hope,"Hi all, first time reddit poster, here. I've been reading this sub for a while. These stories are heartbreaking, but the support in this community is amazing. I wanted to share my experience here, with people who will understand the preemptive grieving I've been going through for the past year.

2019 was the most comfortable I've ever felt with my parents. I've always felt like we just didn't really know how to love eachother. That culminated in 2005 when Fox News convinced my dad I was going to become a terrorist for visiting Turkey. He refused to talk to me for a few months, but eventually apologized and we worked to build back our family. And 2019 finally felt...easy. We enjoyed each others company. We could discuss opposing views and still find common ground. It was great, until March 2020 and the lockdown. 

Dad was consumed with anger. Immediately started spewing conspiracy theories.  Mom soon followed down the rabbit hole. All they did all day was listen to shows like Dan Bongino. Despite me having anxiety attacks, my husband and I still visited every weekend and saw them every holiday. They would start embarassing fights full of BS. We could not talk about anything without it leading to a ""THEY don't want you to be free"" rant. Mom couldn't even listen to classic rock without getting mad about its ""liberal agenda"".

IDK if they ever knew they were parroting Q specifically, but they beleive both that Covid is a Chinese bio-weapon and ""not as bad as the flu"". They believe the election was stolen and that Trump would eventually be inaugurated. Antifa is persecuting poor white supremacists blah blah blah. I don't think they beleive in lizard people, but they definitely buy into ""Dems are ALL EVIL and control the world, but Trump will save us"" rhetoric.

Things have gotten quieter since Jan 6th. Dad has not been hanging out with us when my husband and I visit, but I think it's because he doesn't want to start a fight/make us uncomfortable. They have also been getting outside more. They went sledding yesterday, by themselves, which I think is pretty awesome! I've been waiting for them to decide to cut ties, like last time. But I am hoping that this new avoidance of these topics is a sign they are trying to let go of their anger and move forward. Maybe I'm being too optimistic. I don't know where this is going and I'm exhausted. I'm preparing to lose them, while hoping I won't.

735,Where did it star,"This syndrome didn't begin as Q.  Both my parents were sucked in through the 'f' entertainment network, first to believe Obama wasn't a US citizen and it spiraled from there.

They bought survival bundles saying trouble was coming.  When the ex president campaigned and bad mouthed military heroes in so many ways, I thought Dad the proud ex-Marine would see the light but alas it wasn't meant to be.  I thought Mom would come around a little when we all heard ex president saying ""grab them by the p---y"".  All of this information came through 'f' entertainment network. Dad died 4 years ago, Mom's was developing symptoms of Alzheimer's prior to Dad's death and then full blown dementia shortly.  As long as there are outlets for this type of information and our public officials voice support, this'll never end.  Free speech is fine as long as it isn't things like school shooting are staged, 9-11 never happened, people drinking baby blood, covid isn't real, masks don't help.  Don't understand people who can believe in such things.

737,Putting the Puzzle Together,"I'd like to play Q-detective for a minute, and would love everyone's input. This forum has helped me so much by helping me to contextualize what previously I'd experienced in a horribly personal/isolated way--it had felt like, oh, god, i'm the only person in the world with parents like this, it must mean that insanity runs in my family, and that i'm a bad person for not being able to communicate, etc., etc. 

I think if we can really dig for the explanations here (beyond ""insanity"") we can seriously accelerate our own healing -- and, who knows, society's-at-large :)? 

So, here are a few of the most compelling explanations I've come across in this forum and elsewhere. 

1. Tribal identity -- maybe the most neutral explanation, just says that (some) people will go with their tribe/think with a tribal mind before all else. In my case, my parents were always in the tribe of White Republican Evangelical. The limits of the tribe (the qualities that defined it negatively) were hatred of liberalism, socialism, atheism, market regulation, elite expertise/rationalism/science---all synonymous in their mind with ""Democrats"". 
2. Media bubble -- related to the tribe. In the nineties, my parents were still reading some mainstream publications, but by the early aughts they'd followed the tribe into the rightwing media bubble, sealing themselves into a cultish alternative reality which has metastasized w/ Internet. 
3. Religious / Magical thinking -- Argues that American evangelicals have been primed all their lives to accept things on faith/feeling rather than science; also, they've been trained to equate certain elements of our contemporary society with christianity: namely, capitalism and the free market and businessmen (this is the reason my parents gave for ""believing"" in Trump. ""He's a businessman,"" they'd say -- to them it was equivalent to saying he was good, just, moral, and Christian). 
4. Cognitive dissonance caused by magical thinking -- Argues that it is frustrating/enraging to constantly be in a cognitive dissonance, in which what you are told to believe defies the evidence of your physical senses and experience of the actual world. Alan Watts argued this in the 1960s, raising an alarm about faith-based thinking &amp; society (you can listen to him, for instance, here: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/2SlRSExWYl6n2WbtnallXt?si=evtSmkdPSmKB5hWHh1Xdfw](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2SlRSExWYl6n2WbtnallXt?si=evtSmkdPSmKB5hWHh1Xdfw)). Rage and retreat into a bubble like Q/MAGA are typical responses. 
5. Losing the culture/morality war - The left has won the war over which culture gets to call itself ""moral,"" especially inside mainstream institutions. This drives the right insane, since conservatism has love of institutions and moral uprightness woven into its fiber. Liberals have successfully redefined morality as embracing multiculturalism, racial equality, gender equality, sexual freedom, and respect for the climate, among other things, and have pushed rightwing viewpoints out of the universities, etc. The right has yet to think up a viable response to this, and so has slid into pure opposition and conspiracy. 

I'll stop there -- I haven't mentioned economic explanations (my parents are rich, and i guess probably hate the specter of a future in which they/white people aren't the sole emperors of America), or the ""browning"" of America, or probably a ton of other things....

740,Working with a Q follower.,"Looking for some advice, not sure if this is the right place. 

I work with someone who I am in no doubt is a Q follower. They have recently limited their social media profiles so the crap they post and share is no longer easy to view, although thanks to some internet sleuthing, I have managed to screenshot some of their posts. 

Their role sees them come into contact with the public on a regular basis. Whilst at work, they do adhere to Covid safety guidelines (masks, gloves etc) but in their spare time they post reams of anti vaccine shit, attend anti-lock down rallies and events and do not adhere to social distancing rules. To me, that makes any mask wearing in work null and void if they're mixing with all and sundry the rest of the time. 

Through some further investigation - they also appear to be liking and sharing content that is far right leaning as well as attending events protesting against sexuality education in schools etc. Basically it's a pretty toxic mix of 'Q' supporting, Covid-denial and anti-Semitism.  

I basically want to report them - but don't know A) if I have enough proof and B) if said proof is enough to remove them from their role? 

If anyone could offer some advice, that would be greatly appreciated!",QAnonCasualties
741,I had no idea,"Several years ago, my late 20’s son started talking about Pizzagate and many conspiracy theories. I am slightly left of center not rabid about politics. At the same time, my sister who lived in FL ( who was always conservative) began getting very active with the NRA, buying and carrying guns, sending me links and books.
I listened to both my son and sister, trying to under what they were talking about and doing my own research into the wild claims. My deduction, this was absurd but I wasn’t sure how much they truly believed.
Fast forward a year ago. A friend texted me and stated that my son was posting his conspiracies on FB ( I don’t use FB). I dismissed it as just his way of trolling the “libs” as he called them. My sister and I had quit speaking as I was furious about some of the stuff she was spouting off about and I hung up on her. I missed and loved her, but she was not the sister that I once knew.
Six months ago, the civil discussions and debates with my son began to get more heated. I tried reason, empathy, finding common ground in the fallacy of his beliefs but to no avail. One morning over coffee I lost it, full out screaming, crying, threatening that I would not listen to it any longer. It was intense and I was ashamed that I had lost it.
My sister was killed on her motorcycle at the beginning of the pandemic (careless motorist). Fortunately I had made peace with her a month before and our conversation had no talk of politics. I am thankful for the last conversation that we had.
My son and I settled it and he no longer brings up any Q conspiracies. A few weeks ago he “wiped” his FB and social media accounts of all of the Q bullshit. Wether he still believes it or not, I do not know, but many of his friends explained to him that it was not beneficial to his reputation or integrity. 
All I can say is that I was so incredibly naive; January 6 proved that we have to be vigilant about protecting and preserving critical thinking in all. In hindsight, I am thankful that I did not really understand how far down the rabbit hole both my sister and son had gone or I would have been frozen in fear and emotion.

I do not think I should provide the link, but also included in this evening's text messages is a link to a video from a Bitchute account belonging to Spacebusters. The description of the Spacebusters page is.  

""*Once Were the Living..the story of the 4th Industrial modified reset man. What's been put up your nose in nano dust ""test swabs"" and in your mRNA, 4th Industrial Revolution, Great Reset, how the nano dust tech works, it's all in there.""* 

**THIS IS FROM MY FATHER'S DOCTOR!**

The Spacebusters video is titled:  

# YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT'S IN THE TESTS (ONCE WERE THE LIVING)

The video is 2 hours long. They are always videos and they are always all 2 hours looooooong.  These people don't believe in the written word apparently.

Here we go from the first couple minutes:

The video opens with purported videos of several women having seizures 3 days after the COVID jab, and the voiceover begins, *""It's not a vaccine but a cellular GENETIC MODIFICATION technology, admittedly designed to give those ignorant enough to take it........ a self-creating AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE similar to what used to be called.......AIDS""* They now use the word COVAIDS for the first time.

I'm not trying to get this 100% correct because I think the point is made accurate or not - transhuman, nano-technology, eugenics driven democide and genocide. We have all been duped by germ theory.  Bill Gates is turning us into walking, talking cellphones, something about a horrific brain parasite and the nano-particles are apparently alive and will fight each other. And that's just the test. Mind control and DNA manipulation. 5G frequencies. Crypto slave wages. **THEY ARE LITERALLY GIVING YOU AIDS.**

743,Qultist husband: everyone has turned their backs to him,"Tonight we got into another argument about this stuff and he tells me that he’s upset and feels like everyone has turned their backs to him.

He’s doing all this crazy stuff to himself and won’t drop it and because people choose not to agree (and there are some who unfortunately do agree), he thinks they are abandoning him.   These people he refers to still love him (his family), they just choose not to engage him and support him in this stuff.

It blows my mind that he has the nerve to say something like that when he’s the one that won’t drop it.  I can guarantee his family members are not bringing up Q, Trump, pedophiles, covid hoax and they just want to have a healthy/normal relationship with him.

Not sure if this is gaslighting, him trying to play the victim or some other psychological stunt but it’s all cRaZy CrAzY cRaZy!!

I would like to think this is the new low fir him that might bring him back to reality but to hear him say taxes will be abolished, Trump is still president and currency will soon be backed by gold - makes me realize he’s not coming back to reality anytime soon. We live in Canada, how the hell are taxes going to be abolished? How would we pay for education, roads, hospital visits?  He thinks the world will be a perfect utopia soon and it would be great, but it’s not going to happen.  

Thanks for letting me vent.",QAnonCasualties
744,"Even though I’ve lost my entire family, the one that hurts the most is my grandmother.","She used to be someone I respected so much, someone who would encourage me to think outside of the box and be myself. But somewhere along the line she lost her mind.

She thinks Trump is Jesus. She wants Ivanka to be president if he won’t be able to. What’s horrible is my entire family feeds her this Q nonsense and she has honestly gone senile. I cant speak to her anymore. I can’t visit her ever again.

I go visit her and she shows major signs of dementia, but also brings up this Q bullshit. The last time I visited her was a month ago. She texts me daily begging me to visit her because she is lonely. But when I visit her she triggers my depression because her entire life is consumed by this.

I don’t believe in hell but whoever q is should burn there one day. It’s not fair the lives that have be been stolen by this cult.",QAnonCasualties
745,Mom who lost her daughter to Q and the Anti Vax Qmovement,"Many of you have lost a parent to QAnon I lost my daughter As a single sole parent my daughter was my life Then she became a parent and my once Bernie Sanders liberal loving daughter became a militant anti vaxxer and the anti vaxxers got absorbed into Q

I would have given my life for her but she cut me off completely on Mother’s Day when she was spouting off on all these conspiracies about Covid and Fauci and Bill Gates (so bizarre) and it took only me saying “Wow that is pretty extreme” for her to cut me off completely

In Sept I was diagnosed with breast cancer and the pain from this adult child of mine who knew about my diagnosis was more painful than all the painful treatments I received

Then all of her friends abandoned her and her best friend couldn’t take it anymore and left her

Then she lost her job for her insane posts on social media Now she is losing her social media due to her QAnon anti vax and insane information she is posting on social media

So for all of u who have lost a parent I lost my daughter We should all start a new post QAnon family for all of us who are now QAnon orphans",QAnonCasualties
746,I just watched Above Majestic,"WHAT THE FUCK?!?! First of all, I commend them for remembering such a convoluted and broad story that never ends. Second, it’s just wild. I’m angry that services like Amazon Prime, History Channel, Rotten Tomatoes, and other platforms promote these films and shows (*cough* Ancient Aliens *cough*) I don’t understand how people believe this crap.

My dad started following threads of this back in 2016/2017. It started with these YouTube videos about Sumeria, Aliens, and Monoliths. It evolved into Q stuff. He’s gone to intreatment narcotic rehabilitation twice in Jan, but left both times. I swear he probably started talking about it and they questioned him too much so it added to why he left. He can’t go 5 minutes without explaining some day to day issue away with conspiracy. I’m pretty sure he lost his job this week since rehab was mandatory. He’s a VP of Engineering at a bank, so he should have all the ability to understand reality but doesn’t.",QAnonCasualties
747,My sister was my best friend before this,"My sister and I have always been extremely close however, we have different dads and we grew up entirely different. I grew up in a very diverse household and live in Los Angeles. My sister grew up in upper middle class neighborhoods so has not been exposed to very much outside of typical suburban life. My sister was never a trump supporter or conservative  however shortly after trump was elected she started dating a guy who worked for spacex. They immediately moved in with each other and he decided to move to other spacex locations and my sister went along with him. Shortly after, my sister had a baby with him and they moved to Florida. My sister did not like his trump obsession or his sisters Trump obsession and it made her uncomfortable but she lived with it. Right before covid hit he moved my sister and the kids with him to Florida. This bothered me however they were coming to visit soon so I made plans to spend time with her as much as I could. When the time came, my sister was not able to spend time alone with me or come to my house. We were able to get him to agree to allow us to go to the mall because he was hungover and wanted to take a nap. This was the last time I saw my sister. 

Not long after, he became more obsessed with conspiracy theories and right wing extremism. It wasn’t long before my sister was sending me pictures of them hanging out at a house with confederate flags. Shortly after that they had a stockpile of guns and were spending all night drinking. My sister started to fall down the hole with him and I couldn’t even have a conversation with my sister without him in the conversation. She’s not allowed to visit or even have a job or go to school and she is trapped in the house all the time alone. He would send me link after link after link to bs qanon garbage to try to radicalize me but I am much less impressionable. 

One day my sister face timed me while my boyfriend was over. My boyfriend is from Armenia and has a very heavy accent. They immediately started ridiculing him and asking him why he still speaks English so poorly when he’s been here since the 90s. Ironically, my boyfriend speaks better English than both of them put together and has a college degree unlike either of them, he just has an accent. He started joking back to them but wasn’t disrespectful which then led to her boyfriend threatening him the next day to me. This hurt me deeply.

My sister joined a left wing group I was in and everything was fine until her boyfriend then joined (he has to be a part of whatever she’s doing) and the same day she was posting racist and xenophobic things about Chinese people which obviously got her immediately banned and me embarrassed.

About a week later the George Floyd incident happened and she was heartbroken by the video. She felt what happened to George Floyd was terrible and that night her and her boyfriend got in a big fight about it. Two days later she was calling me repulsive for protesting and “supporting animals”. She sent me a picture of someone burning a flag and I immediately knew this was all him. My sister could give two shits about a flag. 

I was heartbroken but knew I had to cut them off. I blocked my sister in May and haven’t talked to her since. In this time she has been completely radicalized in Q conspiracies and their relationship and lifestyle has become so unhealthy that social services is now involved. I make decent income and can afford to buy a bigger place to get her and the kids away from him but I am scared that she’s gone too far off the deep end. 

Need advice as I am feeling extremely conflicted. I too am a single mother and have a very compassionate and sensitive child to take care of who cannot be exposed to that bullshit.",QAnonCasualties
748,"Anyone had luck in helping their ""Q-Anon sufferer"" ? Q-Anon recovery?","I work in a program that helps people who are experiencing their first episode of psychosis enter and maintain recovery. I also have a sister who is completely immersed in the world of QAnon. If my sister was the only person believing the things she claims to believe in right now, her delusions would mean she would almost certainly be diagnosed as psychotic and possibly schizophrenic. Yet, because many people share these same paranoid delusions and the delusions are literally propagated in memes and youtube videos (i.e., they do not originate spontaneously in my sister's head - as do most delusions in psychosis) then she is more aptly labeled confused, misled, brainwashed, gaslit, etc. And yet...it feels so similar to me. I know how to (well I think I have learned at least somewhat how to ) help someone with psychosis enter recovery. I know telling them their delusions are not real and that they need help does NOT work. I know medication often does work. And there is a fine balance of how to engage someone who is actively psychotic into seeking treatment before they bolt. Often they end up being forced initially. But the medication can really make marked improvements. 

I dont know how to help my sister. I know telling her that the delusions are not real wont work and hasnt worked. She totally shuts down and blocks my phone. But I also dont think medication will help. I feel it is probably more like trying to rescue someone from a cult. Which I have no experience with.

749,The other shoe has dropped,"My husband took me out to dinner, wouldn’t stop talking about politics or negative comments about me and my children.

I said we’re done and I want a divorce. I’m sad for my daughters and scared for me but I can’t take the superiority anymore. I honestly hate him.....what a relief to say that.

750,Historical Context - plagues and mass delusion,"When I observed Q gaining ' traction during the pandemic quarrantines etc. I became quite interested in the Black Plague of the 1300s. Black Death bubonic plague came to Italy from WuhanChina (yes you read that right). From Italy it spread through Europe. Some towns went into mass delusion where they believed the Jews were secretly kidnapping christian children to drink their blood for immunity from the plague. Sound familiar?  These towns often formed mobs who burned all the Jew at the stake. Other towns DI'DN’T fall into such delusions and offered sanctuary to escaping Jews.

The word “cabal” is from the Jewish holy book Kabbalah. 

I don’t know about plagues in pre-Christian societies but it’s easy for me to imagine people sacrificing animals or even other humans to appease the Death Gods.

These memes have been with humanity a LONG time. But never before have they been spread via internet.

The other day I spoke with a friend who was on about adrenochrome. As many here have mentioned ... arguing only leads to arguments. Without contradicting this person’s beliefs I simply talked about history.",QAnonCasualties
751,"Family members have chosen Q, instead of the family","This is my second post to the group, and it pains me that I'm writing again. My story is long, but I'll try to keep it short. I have extended family that have always been extremely religious, and conservative. They've been into Q from the very beginning (5g, pedophile rings, bill gates, covid hoax, vaccine chip, etc.) 

In the fall a family member who believes covid is a hoax, gave my grandmother covid. My mother is her primary caretaker, so this family member exposed both my grandma and my mother to the virus. It was a long road to recovery, but thankfully both are recovered. 

Throughout the last few years when they'd talk about these conspiracies, to me it was absolutely crazy, but in the end sort of harmless. If those are the things you want to believe, then whatever. But when they endangered my mother and grandmother with covid, that completely flipped a switch for me. I told my parents that I'm done with that side of the family entirely. 

My immediate family members wanted to still try to work things out, and had given them forgiveness. They set up parameters, and said that the relationship is at risk if you go beyond them. Its been nothing but a disaster since then. Every conversation has some political jab, and they won't stop mentioning the conspiracies.

The last straw was a couple weeks ago. The family member that transmitted covid to my grandmother, was trying to talk her out of getting the vaccine. Stated that the vaccine is dangerous and it's killing people. After that, the s*** really hit the fan. There's a very likely chance that we will not be speaking or seeing those family members again, until they get out of Q.

I'm just at an absolute lose that these family members are choosing Q over family. For me, the relationship has been over since the fall, but feel horrible for my immediate family members that tried to work things out. I have a few questions below, that I'd like some input on:

Have any of you put up parameters, and your Q person actually respected thoss request? 

When questioned on these conspiracies, they use biblical verses and religion as their main defense. How do you fight against this?

The family member has tried reaching out to me several times, but I've never answered or responded. Is this the right thing? Do I tell them how they hurt me, the family, and that I'm done?",QAnonCasualties

754,I was kicked out of my moms house because I didn’t want to talk about her beliefs.,"In December of last year my mom kicked me out because every time she would bring up Trump or Q I told her I didn’t want to talk about it. She told me that I was trying to “silence her” and she wouldn’t allow me to silence her in her own home. My intention was never to “silence her” I just wanted her to understand that if two people don’t agree on something they shouldn’t have to talk about it. She would continuously bring up her radicalized beliefs and every time it would turn into an argument. I was never able to have a civil conversation with her about anything because she make every conversation about Trump and she even went as far as to compare him to Jesus. Ive been in scary situations with her, she’ll tell me I’m not “ascending” or she’ll attack me psychically or emotionally. She’ll insult my intelligence by calling me names and call me a “bitch”. I can barely talk to my mother now without being on edge or there being tension. She has completely let herself go. The women who raised me was strong and independent. She has gone through a lot recently with her mother passing away, a break up, and she’s been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which made all of her losses take a toll on her mental health. I believe Q preys on people like my mother, people who have mental illness or are vulnerable. I’ve tried to help my mom but honestly I think the only person who can help her is herself. She’s so hell bent on believing in Q and has even started her own little Facebook cult. She’s lost everyone closest to her. My uncle has cancer and because of all of this she believes he’s evil and deserves cancer. She doesn’t check up on him or anyone.

I heard in my address that the world is in danger, he does not know how long it will last.  he does not see changes in himself.  and I cannot explain to him that he is really on the phone for 24 hours.  he falls asleep with the phone and wakes up.  even when he talked with me yesterday,  he constantly updated the news. I tried to explain that I am lonely and don’t have enough of his attention.  but it is as if he does not hear me.  we have quarrels and screams every meeting.  he said he needed to rest and think, although I’m sure I’m just preventing him from exploring further.  I told him that I would not wait for him to think there whether he wants to be with me or not.  blocked him everywhere and left.  I can't believe that some conspiracy can change a person so much.

I posted a while back that my dad and brother went to DC January 6th, and things have been very tense (but also avoidant) in my family ever since. I’ve tried to keep my distance and had successfully avoided any conversation about Trump, Covid, etc until tonight. Unfortunately, we got onto the topic somehow, and my dad completely EXPLODED on me in a complete fit of rage. He was swearing at us, telling us we know nothing, calling me names, told me to grow the f**k up...you name it. My dad has a history of emotional and verbally abusive behaviours so this wasn’t completely new to me, but I haven’t endured it yet when it comes to his Q/Trump beliefs. He took some very personal jabs at me too, which truthfully hurt a lot. I am doing my best to keep civility and peace within my family but am at my wit’s end. I am devastated by this situation and am dealing with unrelated personal stressors on top of it all. I am struggling and he even threw that in my face in his scary attempt to defend his beliefs. He even threatened violence on my significant other. I don’t honestly believe he would follow through on any of this but I am obviously shaken.

To her, anything and everything is related to Donald Trump and the crooked media. You could be talking about an apple and it reminds her that Biden is stealing millions of jobs.

My name is Kim and I run a number of platforms on anti-racism, corruption, and inequality in America. 
I have a very educated father who has gone off the deep end with Trump conspiracy theories. So I very much can relate to the immense pain I’m reading about on this site. 
I believe this whole Qanon deception is yet another symptom of our nations choice to elect officials who do not have personal integrity. What’s happening in our Dem. Republic is complicated but not unprecedented, sadly.
The reason I am posting is I wanted to ask if there was anyone on this site who would benefit personally from doing a video interview about either their experience with Qanon or how a close family member’s experience has impacted them. I’m paid by no one and my allegiance is to the truth ... your story and your truth.
 I’ve done a number of interviews with people who have become members of organizations who have aberrant ideologies or are outside of social norms but have made it out. Integrity and the well-being of the people I interview are my absolute first priority. I will NEVER POST without verbal recorded or written consent after you approve the final video. This is about your story. Also I do not interview people for any reason other than that they would glean something from doing it. I am not here to hurt anyone... but to help explain so people can understand the human side of all this. 
I’ve interviewed the reformed leader of the Mississippi Aryan Brotherhood. I’ve interviewed  an overt racist from Tennessee who now helps educate white folks, and many others.  
I do live shows and post videos on many topics that help people understand inequality, corruption, racism, and bigotry in America today. I work from a historical and scientific viewpoint. 
I want to understand snd I want my viewers to understand the power Qanon seems to have over people. I want to understand the human side of how this sort of thing happens. 
 Please get a hold of me if you think you would benefit from telling your story. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have. If at any time during the process you change your mind about doing a video, I will delete it all with no questions asked. I do not create videos at the emotional expense of my fellow humans. Some people benefit from sharing their story because it can really go a long way to help others. For others who are private, there no way they’d ever be comfortable doing this.

My long time BF broke up with me about 6 months ago due to his belief in conspiracy theories— and my inability to “stop being naive.” I’m talking about 9/11 truther, pizzagate, radiation from cell phones, bin laden already being dead before he was “killed” etc etc. 

I found out about his beliefs when quarantine started, and he started questioning if COVID was overhyped. We got into MASSIVE fights about it for a couple of weeks and finally, he ended things with me. 

I am a scientist, and I left a religious cult about 5 years ago... so I feel well versed in determining what is valid evidence or not. I also would say I’m very open minded. But these... just aren’t even probable at all. And he.... just did not see it.

I recently talked to him again, and he is even deeper in conspiracies. 

I guess I just don’t have anyone to talk to about this. None of my family or friends believe any conspiracies, and the second they heard he believed in them they all told me to drop him immediately.

It’s kind of a self fulfilling project- if you’re looking for something weird- you can find it anywhere if you read into things enough.
And this just reinforces beliefs held by Q follower.

It just feels hopeless. My Q person has only gotten worse and I feel more and more distressed to see the number of “friends” on their Facebook page leap but hundreds every few days, as more Q people connect with them.

In the beginning I would spend an hour or so each day in this futile gesture to report anything that was against facebooks guidelines and Q related. Even though I knew it wasn’t doing anything and Facebook rarely removed the posts, it kind of made me feel a little better at the time....

I’d been kinda hoping when March 4th comes and goes and yet again nothing happens that things might get better, but honestly I don’t think they will and I think I have to bow out of trying at all trying to help my Q person.
I gave it a good shot and tried to be patient and kind and reasonable but I just can’t keep going.

The last thing I have left is that I’ll still be here if they decide to turn away from Q, but until then, I’m going to try and move forward in my own way, even if that means dropping off contact. 
Just feel so shitty and sad.

My father is DEEP into Q and has been increasingly so for years. Today I talked to him and asked if anything would change his mind. He said no...but then later said he would admit if he was wrong. He claims that Q preaches love and thinking for yourself, and that Q followers weren’t responsible for the events Jan 6. He also added that since “enemies” of Q are listening, it is necessary to mix in disinfortmation to throw them (and I suppose loyal Q followers) off.

774,The Psychology of Conspiracy Theories [Online Course - This Discount Link Expires in 5 Days],[removed],QAnonCasualties
775,Could people be drawn to conspiracy theories if they've had adverse childhood experiences growing up? (Addicted to stress hormones and unwittingly seeking out things that will alarm them and suck them in further?),"I read this text by a psychologist and wondered, what percent of people who get sucked into Qanon &amp; fear spirals grew up ""primed"" for this because of unhealthy childhood dynamics? Here's the original text:

. . .

""Adults addicted to their own stress hormones were once children who lived in unpredictable environments of overreaction, rage spirals, and fear."" Dr. Nicole LePera (@theholisticpsychologist) 

She further writes:  
""My childhood environment was stable— meaning my parents were home + all of my physical needs were met. Dinner was at the same time. There was routine.  
But, it was also unpredictable. My dad, overwhelmed with pressure would erupt into yelling fits. My mom would completely shut down into silent treatments that would last for weeks. Because they could not regulate their own emotions, I developed severe anxiety as a child. One of my own childhood memories is around age 7 thinking someone would break in. Or cyclical thoughts that I’d wake up + someone would have died. A manifestation of the stress held in my body— + a nervous system that couldn’t cope.

This steady stream of hormones (adrenaline + cortisol) has all of us in an emotional cycle of highs + lows. Or chaos then lifeless exhaustion of irritability. Unconsciously— I would seek this in my adult romantic relationships. I’d push or knit pick.

When nothing was ‘happening’ I was bored.

I became accustomed to connection + love through my own bodies stress response. It’s how I felt like ‘me.’ It’s how I felt connected to others.

Emotional states create hormonal responses that when experienced long term— imprint both mind + body.

If we learned these states as children, we become adults living in a cycle of our bodies seeking these hormonal responses. All of this is unconscious.

Many adrenaline junkies are seeking that familiar pattern. So are many of us who engage in ‘on + off’ relationship dynamics.

Or spend hours of days consuming content that leaves us feeling angry, helpless, + resentful. Just as we did as children.

Healing is becoming conscious to when we unconsciously seek chaos + stressful states— why we do it + how often. With this awareness, we can begin to choose moments of peace + teach our bodies safety in the present moment.

There’s no shame in being caught in these cycles that the body has learned. The addictive nature is very real + so is the withdrawal."" \~Dr. Nicole LePera, The Holistic Psychologist

So I have to wonder, is that what is making so many people vulnerable to this?? This is like a mass delusion on a scale that I can barely wrap my head around. There have to be factors that play roles beyond just the present.",QAnonCasualties
776,What does your Q person do that irritates you the most?,"Mine is the distrust of science. It's like she is literally waging a war against science and logic. She is so quick to gobble up pseudoscience left and right when it fits her narrative, but actual evidence based peer reviewed studies are all meaningless to her. She buys it all 5G, anti-vax, covid hoax, etc, and the worst is some discredited doctor she listens to that claims their is a dangerous 'sleeper agent' or something in the covid vaccine that can be triggerd in the future by another chemical injection. And the fact that the doctor is discredited is a positive thing in her mind, because it shows she isn't going along with the narrative and they've tried to silence her for it. It so insane, and if I hear that I have to ""do my own research"" one more time I'm gonna snap. I'm suprised she isn't a flat earther by now considering how much she distrusts science.",QAnonCasualties
777,Just kicked my Q mom out of my new apartment,"This will hopefully be my last post here for a while. I’ve had many problems with my mom ever since she fell into that cult but today I’m finally free of living with her and don’t have to put up with her nonsense. Today I was moving in to my new apartment and my parents were helping me out. Our relationship has been mostly fine since the election since we rarely bring up politics. But today as I was putting together some furniture she passingly mentions the office Melania Trump started and I said it was weird she had her own office since she barely did anything and my mom got mad and started defending her.

She said that as a woman she could sympathize with her and respect her intelligence as a model who got with an intelligent man like Trump and ended up as First Lady and that she’s always thinking about what to do next. I kind of let her go on her monologue because I knew what I wanted to respond so I just let her finish.

Once she was done I responded “so how come you don’t ever defend Michelle Obama as a woman?” And she said that Michelle wasn’t a woman that she was secretly a man and that she had seen the pictures that confirms this or whatever. I got so pissed I immediately called her out on her blatant racism and transphobia and told her that the she can’t defend Melania “as a woman” and then immediately disrespect another woman just because she disagrees with her.

She apologized and said I had a point but that she had just gotten really upset I would attack Melania like that and I flat out told her “this is my apartment, under my name, I pay the bills and I will talk shit about whoever I want and if you don’t like it you can leave”. So then she did. And my dad tried to talk to me but I wasn’t having it. I told him he could go get his wife and handle that because I can assemble my own damn chairs.

This has been a year coming and while I admit it wasn’t the best way to handle it, it felt amazing after having put up with her for so long",QAnonCasualties
778,Rothschild vs Putin,Has anyone had their Qcumber talk about how Putun has cut cord on the US dollar and the Rothschild banking cabal? Never mentioning anything about Q but since the cabal and the Rothschilds were mentioned I am assuming it's a Q thing.,QAnonCasualties
779,"Such bizarre claims they are almost laughable, but instead I cry",My Qwife said yesterday that all Mike Lindell's data came from SpaceForce.  Also that Trump is still president.  Also the impeachment trial was all a tactical move orchestrated by Trump.  If Trump farted the would say it's really roses.  Such bizarre stuff.  Got any good ones?,QAnonCasualties
780,My mom and sister are slowly falling for Q and I don’t know how to stop it,"Five years ago my sister had expressed to me that if Bernie Sanders had won the 2016 primaries that she’d be voting for him. Five years ago my mother scoffed and shook her head in shame at the thought of someone showing support for Donald Trump and his hateful rhetoric. By the end of that year, both women ended up voting for him and never looked back. Now in 2021, both women have shared terabytes of misinformation on social media, egged on by my brother’s girlfriend and my dad’s sister both of whom are ardent Trump supporters and anti-vaxx. 

They aren’t at the point where they believe that Trump will save the world, but they’re close. They believe that pedophiles are rampant in our government and in Hollywood but fail to provide any evidence of this. They have both begun having reservations about vaccines even though my sister has already vaccinated her own daughter and my mother has vaccinated all of her children and used to be a supporter of vaccination. I blame both my brother’s girlfriend and my aunt. They took my family’s trust and subtlety whispered lies into their ears, whether intentional or not is still decrepit. I spend hours a day arguing with my soon to be sister-in-law on social media who is just too stubborn to see the facts. 

I now fear they are headed down a dark path of which will take years to recover from. My sister has become more and more hateful towards minorities, specifically black people. She constantly looks for some way to bring up the “double standard” that black people have in that they can get away with rioting and it be called patriotic, which has never happened. She called the rioters at the capitol protestors and refused to blame Trump for their actions. My mother has stated to my girlfriend (and not to me because she knows I’d confront her about that shit) that she will not get the COVID vaccine and that she thinks there isn’t enough research. Luckily I’m 21 and do not require my mother’s permission to get vaccinated. My sister has blocked me on almost all social media, I can’t see pictures or funny videos of my baby niece without asking my girlfriend to show me, all because she says I’m so “close minded”. My sister has become a racist and my mother an antivaxxer and it angers me every day. 

tl;dr: I think my sister and mom are heading down the rabbit hole due to the changes I’ve seen in them during the Trump administration.",QAnonCasualties
781,This is not a post I want to make,"Watching people you love slowly accept and buy into the Qanon conspiracy is heartbreaking to me. Seeing my parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles and others truly believe this stuff is insane to me. The people I thought I knew are not really here anymore, they have checked out, they have joined a cult. 

This is not a post I want to write or enjoy writing, but here we are.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I think buying into this stuff happens slowly over the years. I don't know if anyone else feels this way also (please comment if you do) but I think this can be traced back over a decade ago to when Qanon was not even a thing. My grandparents had recently retired and subsequently were faced with more free time. My family has always been more conservative than liberal, and originally we were not super ultra-conservative people, but generally believed in stuff like personal responsibility, tradition, rule of law, less taxes in general, regulation might not always be a good thing, etc. So when my grandparents retied they began spending more and more time watching Fox News, where they would listen to this stuff for a good portion of the day. I remember my grandmother driving my siblings and I somewhere when I was 13 and she had some radio talk show person on, who eventually started commenting about the Obama administration. My grandmother then told us about how Obama was really a Muslim, and was not born here, and is not a real American. When you are that young I don't think you really grasp the significance of saying something like that, but looking back its a telltale sign. Those embers of conspiracy theories have always kind of been there in my family, slowly simmering under the surface and eventually gave way to Q.

Over the years my grandparents would tell these things to their kids and in-laws who would listen, did not necessarily mean that they believed everything but they listened. It's become more and more apparent over the years. Another time I stopped by my grandparents house about 2 years ago and in the 2 hours I was there,  probably 75% of the time was them talking about how the left and Democrats are trying to destroy America, when I just stopped in to surprise them since I was in the area. That was the last time I ever did that. Now after 4 years of these things being injected into the mainstream, they were primed and ready for something like Qanon. My grandparents bought in lock stock and barrel and took other family members down with them over the quarantine when they had nothing but time and spent it on the internet where it was being circulated. They fully believe these things. Now after the election and pandemic with baseless fraud claims and theories about the virus being fake out there, they bought into those also. My family is full of hard-working, good, kind, thoughtful and loving people. I have never felt anything other than support and love from them. But now I am almost viewed as a traitor for not buying into Q like they did.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way or has realized this; but I think stuff like fox news or conservative talk radio have really acted as stepping stones for Qanon. I think people who buy into one thing end up falling down a rabbit hole that leads to Qanon and all the attendant lunacy that it comes with. I don't know what to do, anytime I try to reason with them they say I am brainwashed and indoctrinated by the liberal media. I feel like there is no reasoning with them anymore. To quote a political strategist, ""Sometimes you can't get to a yes with a person who is so utterly implacable, they won't say anything other than no."" 

I also want to add something I think is important to my story. I have been a conservative person and identified as a republican all my life. A lot of the things I have believed in like a strong military, fiscal and personable responsibility, free trade, and originalism to name a few, I still believe in. But now I feel like I am in the minority on my side of the spectrum. Being a conservative today means you worship Donald Trump, think he is the rightful commander-in-chief after a fraudulent election, and believe in whatever conspiracy theories he endorses. So it's just frustrating to me when I am called a defector and betrayer of the faith for not endorsing lunacy. I am essentially a conservative in exile: too old-school republican for the left and not crazy enough for the right.

Qanon has debased any political ideology in my family. I feel like they are part of a cult. I don't know what to do to address this anymore. Any time I push back I am mocked and discounted, and whenever I stay silent it is taken as complicity and validates these claims in their minds. I feel like I can't win no matter what I do. If anyone has any advice or wants to share something please comment. Thank you.",QAnonCasualties

She will go on long tangents or call me crying asking whether my boyfriend and I have been enlightened yet; she automatically gets angry when I tell her that no matter what we each believe, we can’t change anything. Just need to wait it out. That started leading to how she would be at the forefront of the protests against vaccines or pro-Trump rallies if there were more in her area. 

I’m struggling with respecting her opinions, she calls me stupid and ignorant although I have a degree and a job within the government. My position is considered essential which is now another reason she calls me crying in fear of me getting vaccinated.",QAnonCasualties

785,Is My Sister Q?,"My sister has gone down the rabbit hole over the last 12 years. It started with the Obama presidency and now its off the rails.

As far as I know, she hasn't mentioned satan worshiping pedophiles but that's about it. Do you think she's Q or just an ultra right wing conspiracy nut?

I don't have a relationship with her anymore. She is very smug and acts like she has superior knowledge. She is convinced I voted for China and am one of the sheep. She spends hours and hours posting the same drivel and has gotten kicked off of multiple sites because of her conspiratorial beliefs. I don't think there is any getting through to her.

791,Indirectly losing my husband to QAnon,"My husband has always been relatively conservative, but even from the beginning of Trump, he thought the guy was a con-man. His family on the other hand embraced Trumpism wholeheartedly, and then when they perceived even regular right-wing media outlets as being ""too liberal"" (aka too critical of Trump), they turned to some really darks parts of the internet for information, which as you can guess, led them to QAnon.

I remember when I first told my husband about QAnon last summer, he laughed and thought it was some hyper fringe thing and the media was probably blowing its prevalence out of proportion. Now that so much of his family has embraced it, he's a little horrified, but he thinks he can use reason and logic to get them back into a shared plane of reality. 

This has caused a lot of strain in my marriage. I don't want to spend time around his family any more. They literally can't even talk about puppies and the weather without turning it into some Q shit. They openly call me a communist who hates American and supports pedophiles. I've never heard my husband try to seriously defend me from these accusations and whenever I bring up how insulting their words are, he shrugs it off saying, ""they're just passionate about what they believe and said something they didn't really mean"" and ""you're just being too sensitive.""

Yet whenever I call his family crazy or point out that they're peddling lies that are destroying the fabric of our society, he immediately tells me to stop bashing them. The other night he literally said ""I need to stop picking on his family just because they have differing views."" He tells me I just need to take a break from the news and stop being so triggered by his family. 

The truth is, I don't ever bring up his family: *he* does. I would prefer not to have any talk of Q in my house, but he talks to them every day and patiently listens as they rant about Q stuff. He still tries to refute it, but it usually it just ends up with a lot of equivocating about how *yes*, he thinks Joe Biden is really creepy and okay maybe *sometimes* conspiracies have been true and sure, maybe there was *some* election fraud but probably not enough to affect the outcome of the election.

I now feel like I'm in a battle with his family over my husband's grasp on reality. I'm starting to feel like they're gaining ground. There's absolutely no way he's going to stop talking to them. He says all the time that he will never put politics over family, but lately it feels like he's putting his family over our marriage, and because all his family cares about is Trump and QAnon, he is in effect putting their politics over they family we've made together. I'm not his blood but we've been married for 8 years. *I'm* his family too. 

To anyone who lost a loved one to this conspiracy, how did it start?",QAnonCasualties
792,Lost a good friend to this nonsense,"I don't know if my friend, like me a disabled Army vet, is specifically into QAnon, but all the symptoms are there. We met doing advanced scuba training so we could teach scuba for a non-profit charity that gets disabled vets scuba certified and runs group trips. We thought that it would help show that if we (I am an amputee and he has limited use of his shoulder and arm) could do it, anyone can. 

  
We never had a political conversation....until trump got elected. 

  
Over the past year or so he has totally changed. He has become embittered, drinks heavily, and began having thoughts of harming others and himself in some grand gesture.

The last 3 times he called me, he immediately launched into a tirade about how only Fox news tells the truth and literally every other source on the planet is lying. It is this oddly specific fascination with fox news and trump as a savior that can do no wrong. It's just weird how he obsesses over specifically fox news and seems to get 100% of his 'information' from that source without ever questioning it. 

At first I tried to just debunk his nonsense- so our phone conversations became me having to Google facts to 'prove' his claims false. He would throw out some ridiculous claim, or just deny my points were valid until I was forced to provide a bibliography for everything I said. You can image how unfun that is. We stopped talking about scuba diving ages ago. 

After this went on, I have to admit I stopped being so polite and these conversations became arguments. I let my frustration come thru, exasperated with not only this crazy obsession with fox news, but his increasingly radicalized and hateful beliefs about anyone that dared question this new reality. He didn't have an opinion of his own, he was simply regurgitating whatever fox news told him. 

The final call came where he began the conversation bragging to me about how much he was drinking lately. Like he was proud of this. Then launched into his fox news obsession once again. My mistake was engaging again, and it ended up in a shouting match. I had mentioned a statistic, he challenged it so again I was forced to provide a source (in this case the US census) to prove my claim. I was right, he was clearly wrong. He accepted that but then jumped to dismissing statistics as a whole. It was insane on it's face- anything that damages their crazy world view is either a lie, or suddenly irrelevant. But in the next sentence tried to use statistics he pulled out of nowhere (well, pulled from fox news) just moments after telling me statistics are all lies. I lost my cool at that point, and I feel bad about it.   
He then confided in me that he was thinking that the VA was doing him wrong, and if they didn't see things his way, he would go to DC and harm others and himself in some violent gesture. He was vague on exactly what he would do, but it was incredibly alarming. I chalk it up to alcohol fueled bravery that he wouldn't act on. It's hard to tell when someone that is halfway thru a bottle is serious or not. 

At some point he hung up on me (by now we were in a full on shouting match) and texted me that we were no longer friends. That it was my attitude that wasn't up to his standards. Nevermind that it was him calling me, drunk, and spouting violence and self harm. Nevermind that the entire call was to get me indoctrinated into believing fox news, and only fox news. To my sober mind, it was nothing short of batshit insane. It just didn't make sense, and this wasn't the friend that I had known for several years. I know his family, I was the first friend he had at his new house. But now he is angry, fearful, lost in a sea of propaganda he can't tell from reality. Anyone that doesn't agree with him needs conversion...I can only imagine the environment at home for his wife and kids. 

That's my story about this nonsense. A good friend where I have very few, lost to toxic propaganda and hateful rhetoric. A quiet racism where ethnicity is a scapegoat. A world where the guy caught red handed trying to steal an election is somehow innocent and had the election stolen from him. I never heard of QAnon before- but I consider it all part and parcel of trumpism. I am not sure he even knows what QAnon is, but is a member of the cult nonetheless.

My aunt who is a high school drop out has told me and the rest of the family that college is where they indoctrinate liberals.
She constantly sends my mom  conspiracy theory videos on YouTube and other radical Q websites. I finally cut her out of my life after she tried to pick a fight with me after I told her I didn't want to hear about how the election was stolen by the blood drinking democrats. My cousin who is a cop fuels the fire with my aunt and they both have become so radical in a short amount of time. They both lives in California which in its self is hilarious.  My poor mom has to deal with her because she takes care of my 99 year old grandmother. She even took my grandmothers car and put it in her name after trashing 2 other cars she got for free. But her behavior is acceptable because she is a ""christian.""  As a believer in Jesus Christ I get upset because she comes from a place of hate which Jesus was not about or for.  
I also lost a friend who I've known for years and he is college educated of all things, he has a masters in history and I saw slowly how he was becoming more radical. Blaming Jan 6th on antifia because you know they dressed up as Trump supporters. Blaming the fires in CA this past summer on antifia saying they were starting fires on purpose. Believes covid is a hoax and got aggressive  with me because I wear a mask and take it seriously.  I just finally said screw it and haven't heard from him since right after Jan 6th.

My dad is too much of a coward to oppose her. He just agrees with her on some parts he likes or he goes into another room if she starts talking about things he doesn’t like. 

My mom at least talks to me and allows me to share my point of view.  My dad just disengages, ignores me or didn’t respond to my texts when I ask him how he feels about all this. 

This is my first post here. I’m just venting. I’m not looking for tips and tricks to change their minds. I’ve tried and tried. Logic and reason don’t matter when they knowingly and deliberately choose willful ignorance.

As someone who is borderline obsessed with countries notorious for tricking and subjugating their populations via media and personality politics? I “have no idea” what’s “actually going on.” I am a disappointment, and someone who has “strayed from god.” I’m so so so tired of hearing my mom say that she can’t be wrong because why? She has the Holy Spirit inside of her. 

I’m staying with them (just graduated) and joining the Air Force this summer, but was also temporarily homeless January 6th-12th because they kicked me out! My dad told me never to return after I corrected my mom that no, the mob at the Capitol was not antifa. They said horrible things to me, told me I can never speak about my politics again, and to grab my shit and go.

Next thing we know it’s AR 15‘s and we aren’t entirely sure what else but we know there are more. My husband asked him why he was buying so many and I was told it was to protect the house from antifa. They had a huge fight about it and didn’t speak for six weeks.

We know he voted for Trump both elections. And last week we talked to my father-in-law and found out that he threatened to disown him because my father-in-law who voted for Trump in 2016 switched to Biden because he felt that Trump had lied and did nothing for him or anyone else. My father-in-law said he was worried that my brother-in-law was into “deep Internet shit“ and “his brain just ain’t right.”

I know that this could also be indicative of involvement in right wing or white supremacist groups rather than Q. However the other night when he was talking to my husband he made a comment to the effect of if we had children we would think differently about the whole thing. That’s what stuck with me and made me think Q.

Source: **freejoy.aimoo.com**

The problem of United States Of America is lack of a real godlike leader.  
They   are losing on trade because they are too stupid, despite the fact they   are holding the most powerful tool of the game, which is technology.

If   Donald Trump the best CEO in USA who have the most real life  experience  cannot fix help America, then there is no any other CEO of  any  cooperation or any other American people can help. Because running a   business to take money from the sleepy public people is not as the  same  as take money from the same “level” opponent which are other  leader  groups from other nations.  
You can only deceive the stupid public people, but you cannot deceive the smart people.

The last hope for the USA is me the real savior Messiah Buddha.  
This article is the last signal I can give you for free of charge.

I have provided few ideologies about the future system. But in particular the USA situation, the solution should be like this:  
**Step 1:**  Setup  new political party which ideology of “everybody is equal,  everybody  can become president”. No left, no right, no central, only  “good,  suitable”policies, all people from all background are welcome.

**Step 2:**  Educate  the public people about the political system and what is  corruption,  and explain to them the only way to reduce corruption which  is give back  power to local government and the people.

**Step 3:**  Win the  election and allow new states to be established. In the new  states,  minimum wage will start from $0, and not under the federal  government  rule. Some example new states such as “only undocumented  migrants” or  “only black/white/yellow skin people”.

With this strategy, even in the current global financial system rule the problem around trade will be solved.

By   having new political party with “leaderless”, you are waking“God”  power  within everybody. The only different between the“politicians” and  you  are just they are corrupted and you are not.

If you cannot have a new political party to education people, you cannot win this game.

Starting   from 0 point seems hard but with 4 years, you can easily win the   upcoming 2024 election. Because you are using the better “God” ideology   of life than the fake voting democracy.

I  have a lot of other  strategies and methods to win this easy game, but I  cannot giving out  for free because there are many other nations as  well.

Make fair  amount of  donation, then I will giving out more details and other  Godlike  strategies which no any entities can counter it for they are the  Divine  way of life.

811,New to the sub: A brief introduction and some tips for shutting diffusing a q anon rant.,"Hey guys. I'm sorry to say that the shared psychosis that is q anon has finally made its way to my family. My aunt, mother, and father were all Trump supporters who listened to right-wing talk radio, but never really got into conspiracy theories, until the Capitol riot kicked off all the talk about martial law and such. Now they have been gradually digging into q anon at a very alarming rate. 

I used to be a conspiracy theorist between the years of 2010-2015, so I have an idea of the pathological effects q anon can have on one's mind. It took me years to heal myself from the self-inflicted psychological wounds that came with the conspiracy theory mindset. Before, I used to be the ""nut-job"" of the family, thinking everything was a false-flag event, and now, my Christian family has latched on to q anon's propaganda like its the Gospel, and they seem to be degenerating faster than I was. It's like I just got away from my old mind-set, and now its all around me, haunting me. It's really a bizarre experience. 

I don't really know how to help my family members, but I can't just let them go crazy without saying something. I tried listening to them. That's what I wanted when I was into the NWO theories. I even asked them questions within the parameters of what they present me to try and gently point out the absurd contradictions in their *Theory of Everything*. 

Their logic is not penetrable. You can't fact check the overwhelming amount of lies and half-truths q anon puts out, and when you do, they twist the context to fit it into their theory. 

My family and I are all Christians, so I've found that the only thing that will silence them is to show how q anon runs against the teachings of Jesus Christ--**who told us to keep the peace to the best of our ability, love our neighbor as ourselves, and not to resist our enemies (but treat them with love).** I've managed to successfully diffuse two arguments with that approach, but it doesn't look like they've really budged in their q anon beliefs. Hopefully, if I keep trying, they will have to face their internal beliefs surrounding Christ. 

Maybe this technique will backfire. Who knows? Maybe they'll resent me even more for pointing out how q anon is contrary to their core identity. I don't know. What I do know is that things went from 0 to 80% crazy for my family in less than a week. I doubt this is an isolated phenomenon. 

Do you guys have any tips or experiences to share?

Thanks.",QAnonCasualties
812,Ugh. Mom,"Idk. I just need to vent. 

I am at such a loss. I’ve always been super close and protective of my mom, especially since my dad passed 15 years ago. But ever since the august 2020 she’s gone into the Q-hole. 

It’s shocking because politics have never been an issue. She voted Obama twice and tends to side middle of the road on most issues. But now it’s trump trump trump. Obama was awful from day 1 blah blah blah. 

We’ve never really been a huge political family and have respected each persons views. But now that’s just gone. I’m “not seeing the world with open eyes.” I’ve begged her to stop getting news from her friends off Facebook. But it’s just getting worse and worse. I can’t even have a conversation without it getting political. I’ve given ultimatums. Which I regret. But it doesn’t matter. 

I guess I’m just sad because I’m losing my mom. I don’t recognize this person she’s becoming. Someone who I trusted and would seek advice from is now angry, anxious, scary, and just everything that goes along with Q. And I’m at a loss. My siblings can “deal” with it but I’m very outspoken and will voice my concerns. But this is really destroying our relationship. And it’s incredibly sad.

814,QPersons and the United States Constitution,"My co worker is a victim to Q stuff and I have a history education degree. I enjoy politics and I love knowing how things like our government works. 

He often brings Q items up in conversation. He’s never mentioned Q and I’ve never brought it up to him. When he isn’t talking about Q, I feel that he is a very good person at heart. 

I’ve noticed his obsession with protecting the constitution but clearly having no understanding of how it works. He believes the election was stolen and everyone (courts, states, congresspeople etc.) is corrupt and that the military can seize power to protect the constitution. 

Of course, I explain to him that constitutionally speaking Biden is our president. All the required constitutional activities happened to determine our next president. People voted, states certified, congress counted, and Biden swore his oath and became president. The military itself would be breaking its oath by seizing power and installing a leader. 

He believes Mike Lindell over the courts. I don’t think he has ever read the court cases and thinks they provided overwhelming evidence. Read a bit on the cases and you will see the Trumps campaign offered little evidence and often picked fights over inconsequential numbers of votes. 

Has anyone else run into this odd misinterpretation of the constitution? The worry about individual freedom (something that is important to me as well) but also supporting a military takeover is so hard for me to even talk about. The basic understanding of how our government works just isn’t something he had. It can feel impossible to approach these subjects when living it totally different realities.",QAnonCasualties

816,Does anyone else think entertainment themes has primed qanon believers?,"By that I mean the prevalence of conspiracy theories in film, books, TV, even video games. Doesn’t feel like there was as much of this a few decades ago. The villains were more often individuals or readily identifiable groups of bad guys where now it’s all betrayal by people the hero previously trusted who are part of a grand evil organization. Sure, there have been actual conspiracies in history but the competency and reach of qanon enemies just seems fictional. IMO real people aren’t competent enough for    a functional canal.

817,Anyone familiar with Children's Health Defender? Feel like my father is slipping.,"Hi r/QAnonCasualties, I never really pictured myself posting an actual post here, but alas here I am. My father was a former Alex Jones listener back in 2008 until about 2014, my father absolutely hated Barack Obama, but now can admit he was okay; however my Dad said he listened to it for mostly ""satire"" as the stories were insanely outlandish (the one we joke about is the FEMA deathcamps). My Dad as a lifelong Republican unsurprisingly voted for Donald Trump and ate up the loud mouth bigotry Trump spewed. My Mother an independent even did the same. My Dad supported Trump until about 2019, I can't exactly say when the tide turned for sure, but with the pandemic my Dad suddenly became terrified. He actually started wearing a mask back in February, and myself as a healthcare worker, he would lose his mind when I showed up after a shift in February. Suddenly, it was like the veil was lifted, he realized Trump was completely incompetent as soon after I lost my job, classes went online, I started sheltering in place, etc. My father suddenly realized, nobody had a plan and a lot of people were going to die. 

During this time, he was also laid off and had a death in the family so he retired, this is key here because it gave him all the time in the world ""to do research"". His sleep schedule was soon thrown completely off and he would sleep all day and stay up all night, rinse and repeat. So while he still hated Trump and acknowledged COVID was a dangerous threat and that mask wearing was incredibly crucial to stopping the spread; he'd also say crazy shit like ""you know this was made in a lab right?"" followed by him linking me to a super discredited ""research"" paper by a discredited Chinese scientist who claimed the virus escaped a lab in Wuhan. I pointed out the logical and bias flaws in the paper, including looking up multiple ""companies"" and ""contractors"" mentioned who all were not real individuals. He seemed to acknowledge it with a ""thank God you know how to really rip these things apart, guess you're learning something in college!""

So life was good until about the end of May when the George Floyd protests started, suddenly his old racism was back, calling the protestors thugs and looters who ""need to stop mooching off me and get back to work."" This was a tense period of time for us as I attend school for public health and my interest is in the social determinants of health, so I literally research the inequities these communities of color face and their impacts on their health. Eventually, my father surprisingly caved, and admitted that a lot of cops are out of line and ridiculous. Life again was good, the election came and went and my parents were elated that Biden won, myself more relieved (?) that things would slowly return to the capitalist nightmare we lived in before Trump. 

With December coming, I slowly was promoted in my healthcare role and qualified for the first round of COVID vaccines (Pfizer) at my job, I excitedly signed up for the vaccine and told everyone I knew I was getting it so they could come to my about my personal experience, I hoped this would alleviate some of the fear mongering going around; especially in my rural hometown. I got the vaccine and visited my parents that weekend, my father was suddenly angry and outraged that I had gone through with getting the vaccine, telling me ""Why would you get that fucking poison injected into you? Willingly?"" To which I replied, I had done plenty of reading into studies about mRNA vaccines, their safety, how they are created, and read the individual data on the Pfizer and Moderna reports to which I concluded that the risk vs benefit ratio was significantly in my favor for benefit. My father gave me the classic ""Oh you think you know everything going to college hmm? Smart man all of a sudden?"" I was outraged and insanely upset, telling my mother that I would happily schedule an appointment for her, but my father was on his own since all of a sudden, he was a vaccine expert. My mother later texted me saying my father was sorry and that he wanted me to look for an appointment for him. 

Queue to this week, my father was set to go out of town to visit a friend down south at the beach, all of a sudden the friend cancelled because a contact of his got COVID from a friend coming out of town, my father's friend decided the risk wasn't worth it and cancelled. My father sick of being at home was devastated, coming up with all kinds of crazy nonsensical reasons why his friend cancelled i.e. he must hate me, he's tired of me visiting, etc. So a few days ago, I call my father absolutely shaking, I got him a COVID vaccine appointment, it was a bit of a ways away, about an hour drive, but he was set to go. Suddenly he texts me saying ""I don't trust it."" So I kind of give him some time to process it, figuring he woke up grumpy as it was 8am and he was a night owl. I text him a ""I don't really know how to respond, so I'll give you some time to think things over, talk soon bye."" Queue to tonight, he texts me asking about his appointment and if it's cancelled. I tell him that his appointment is still on since it's 2 weeks away so I figured I'd give him a little over a week to consider it. 

And now to the point of this long winded post, he links me to [Children's Health Defense - the Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/) , so I do a few quick searches and find that it is known for its anti-vaccine activism. I also pick an article at random and point out all the issues with it such as the Bell's Palsy cases are the same percentage as those in the population who randomly acquire Bell's Palsy, meaning it's unrelated to the vaccine. I also say out of 10 million plus doses of the vaccine, 600 ""reported deaths"" is incredibly low and mention that most of them once again, match the number of random cardiac deaths in the population. All my father says is ""I'm glad I read this before it's too late, these people are actual doctors, how am I not supposed to believe them!"" and then went on to ridicule my academic career (you're just a semester away from a MPH, these people have MDs!!). I'm not really sure what to do as I broke my whole family out of this crazy Trumplican cycle this past Spring (my mother was the easiest, followed by my younger brother, and then my Dad). I felt like I was making such incredible progress within my family and my ""radical liberal politics"" such as free healthcare and free education were becoming normal dinner talking points with good conversation. Now all of a sudden, vaccines are bullshit, I'm better off if everyone else gets it, etc. I also reminded him that he regularly smokes good ole cowboy killers AKA marlboro reds and that he never gave a shit about what was in them and what they did to his body, but suddenly he's concerned about ""long term effects from a vaccine, it's too new, I don't want that mRNA shit, I'll wait for the J&amp;J shot."" So I guess in the end it's not awful as he said he'll gladly get the J&amp;J shot since it's a altered virus rather than mRNA, but who knows if that'll hold up since that same garbage website Children's Health Defense comes up with some crazy article saying J&amp;J gives you COVID. 

If you've read this far, thank you. It feels good to type all of this out, I can't really say this aloud to anyone in person since the only people I really see in person are at work and unfortunately about half of them (in healthcare nonetheless!) are also crazy Trumplican / QAnon believers.",QAnonCasualties
818,How to deal with anger?,"I’m far from an angry person. I have been so patient for years. For the first time this week, I have anger building inside my chest anytime I think about my 2 Q casualties. I don’t want to match their anger with my own (which likely isn’t even half.)

While it would be difficult to go after Q directly, I wonder if it would be possible to shut it down by holding the platforms that host this nonsense responsible through class action lawsuits alleging complicity in the pain and suffering caused by these cult theories?

820,I have to forgive someone who isn’t sorry,"My mother isn’t Q however she believes in lizard people, chemtrails, an antimasker, a the coronavirus is a hoaxer and she says the wifi is killing her..she’s “wi-fried”. This has been going on for a few years now. It started with pizza gate and the flat earth and has moved through a plethora of conspiracies, now it’s 5G. Through the years the relationships my mother has had with members of our family have been strained, some are ruined and now everything is in shambles. She claims that they’re not conspiracies, it’s the truth and she is a proud truther. She says she can’t stop, she can’t un-know what she knows and she is going to figure out the truth of the universe. My mother says it is absolutely possible to know what the creators of the universe know and she has divine wisdom. 
My two younger brothers, dad and I have all tried many different ways to approach the situation. We’ve had family meetings without her to vent and share because she can get very volatile if anything about her beliefs are mentioned. I’ve tried to get her into hobbies to take her away from the iPad, I’ve tried to get her up and moving around to prove that the wifi isn’t crippling her. We’ve tried to be open and listen hoping she would do the same..absolutely not. We are lost, wrong, uneducated, sheep...she thinks her family members are bots. She calls us bots now. 
The weight of the abundant knowledge that she has been retaining is stressing her out to the point of alcoholism. She was an alcoholic 15-20 years ago, stopped for that period of time and now she’s back on the sauce. A mean, angry, spiteful drunk because she doesn’t understand why her family has “done this to her” we won’t join her side. She’s consumed with doom and negativity, pointing that out to her is useless. Rationalizing is useless, logic is futile. Shes  quick to say “no no, thats fear porn I don’t look at that fear porn”...as she drinks and cries because she’s so scared, depressed and stressed out from all the horrible things she knows now. The worst part is during these drunken meltdowns she says how much staying away from the internet would change her life and she knows she needs to stop and she can’t and she won’t try. 
Last year we didn’t talk or see each other for 7 months. I wrote her a very long letter opening up to her about everything..begging to have my mom back. We all want our mom. She passed my house on the way home from work every day for those 7 months and never cared to try to mend things. I’m tired of being the parent. I have to take over her roll for both of my younger brothers as well. I needed a break for my own sanity. Then the holidays rolled around and things sort of were okay so we started speaking again and I felt that I could try to start going to my parents house again. I definitely felt that it was too soon for me as my mother hadn’t changed much and didn’t seem to really be phased all that much by me disappearing for half a year. She’s the type to just repress, bury and not deal with anything at all and just hope a peaceful dinner will cute everything that ever happened, while she continues to act however she wants and knowingly hurt the people close to her. She knows because we tell her and it really doesn’t matter to her she’s the victim of the 5G and a victim of all of us. This woman went as far as to visit 4 different doctors to prove that the 5G radiation is why she’s so tired, can’t sleep, moody, nauseous and just actually killing her. When a handful of tests all came back normal she was just then validated that it is indeed the Wifi and every doctor is an idiot that is corrupt and can’t be trusted ma she definitely and absolutely knows more than all doctors. It has nothing at all to do with her immobile, isolated, anxious, drunk tumble down this internet rabbit hole. Our family doctor refuses to see her anymore. 
Today she told me that she isn’t going to change and I need to stop being judgmental and negative. She doesn’t need help, I need to stop living in the past and accept her. She’s busy solving this mystery. 
When she said “I put the truth before my family” my heart broke....I realize that I really do need to keep my distance from her for my own sake and the guilt is tremendous. The frustration and the bewilderment that overcomes me in regards to this situation are so fucking unhealthy for me, my siblings and my poor dad who has to live with her. I can’t live with the anger the hurt that manifests itself as hate..I can’t live with the resentment. I have to forgive my mother even though she isn’t sorry in the slightest. I have to forgive my mother even though she claims she won’t change. I need to forgive my mother for the hypocrisy and for tearing my family apart without a care. So how?",QAnonCasualties
821,Did any of your Q people start out following Anonymous?,"Hi, this is my first post. Sorry in advance I'm not the best at delivering my thoughts effectively. But reading though so many stories I just questioned the possible correlation between Q and other groups.

I have some people I know who went down the Q rabbit hole and normally I'm very open minded but upon being sent youtube documentaries about the cabal. I immediately shut it down. They tried to pull the agree to disagree. I said no there is no agree to disagree on this one. I won't even entertain it. 
On the flip side I would have anonymous content sent to me and I would say yeah that's wild but who knows. 

Both have different fundamentals but I feel Qanon copied Anonymous and when Anonymous went MIA Q took the opportunity to sway opinions to deeper conspiracies. I'm just trying to figure out how Q acquired such a huge global following so quickly. Was it partly due to copying other groups. And is it possible that those groups may be able to bring some people back to a place of normalcy? 

Q has destroyed so many lives, there are people who are just followers and they need something or someone to follow, maybe a solution is giving them another cause to follow?

825,Today's impeachment acquittal has only made things far worse,"Trump was acquitted today. This was, for the most part, expected because of the numbers needed to convict versus Republicans who would still support Trump. Even though this was an expected outcome, they are using it as proof that their conspiracies are real and my Q friend is now doubling down more than ever. My hope was that after March 4th came and went, maybe she would eventually wake up to reality. But now, I know for sure that when March 4th doesn't bring about her expected outcome, she'll continue to move the goal post. 
I keep hoping that with each failed ""prediction"" she would eventually feel stupid and common sense will kick in but today's hearing has undo any progress toward that end.

826,Chinese QAnon / Miles Guo,"I’m worried for my mom. She’s always been incredibly intelligent and resourceful, and I love her so much but I fear that she’s going down the rabbit hole of QAnon-type conspiracy theories. She follows Miles Guo, who fled from China and promotes anti-CCP conspiracy theories and QAnon on his platform. I think there’s good reason to believe that CCP does some pretty messed up things but she’s convinced that the virus was created by the CCP as an attack on Americans, and that mainstream media takes money from the CCP and is covering up the news from the whistleblower. Her logic — what reason is there for the whistleblower to risk her life and lie? 

To be honest, she’s completely fine if we avoid topics like covid and politics, and it hasn’t been as bad as some other stories I’ve seen here, but I’m at a loss for what to do to help her see the light. ESPECIALLY because all the info she consumes is in Chinese and (1) my Chinese sucks and (2) most Chinese news outlets are either CCP propaganda or anti-CCP propaganda, from what I understand. There’s no way for me to present her with facts to prove her wrong. 

Does anyone else have similar experiences with Chinese parents? And if anyone could offer advice on how I can help my mom while she’s still not completely gone for good? It’s so easy to just ignore that side of her but I’m worried that it’ll consume her a few years down the line.",QAnonCasualties

We’ve all seen the difference between a conservative and ... this... in the span of 5 years. Yeah, they were conservative before the big orange asshole, but I’m like at least I didn’t have to grieve them twice. 

There were years I didn’t talk to my grandparents. My abusive ex fed the paranoia that my family hated me and I could only be safe with him. I was fresh out of high school and I was a walking contradiction of all the right wing christian bullshit that I was force fed all my life.

It sucks, but it’s like the only positive out of all this mental terrorism caused by Q-spiracies, is that I’ve already lost my grandparents and I can’t lose them again. 

(On a side note, sometimes my grandparents visit me in my dreams and they never mention religion, politics, all the things that they were fervent about in life. The first time it happened we were standing in the clouds and I kept asking if god was real, if any of it was real, and all kinds of things and all my grandma kept telling me was, “It’s all going to be okay,” over and over again. It’s refreshing, and they always come when I need their help without mentioning a damn thing about politics or god or any of it.)",QAnonCasualties
829,From the other side?,"First, allow me to establish that I probably am more right-leaning than anything else but I am not very interested in politics. I got out of my ""gung-ho giving a shit phase"" five or six years ago. I moved on from giving a shit about the day-to-day happenings within that ~~swamp~~ toxic waste dump which we know the District of Columbia.


There was a time where I'd be sitting there with some friends watching SNL when a skit would come on. They would say some shit about a political pundit/commentator who was on ""my side"" and would instantly feel that fight or flight response. Hell, one time I saw a TYT logo on my friend's computer screen and I felt that sensation...

Heart-rate goes up, and I would just feel the bad kind of butterflies my tummy. **In a way, it felt like I was physically sick** and I guess this would be a called a physiological response. Well anyway, I took notice of it and over the course of a year or so I worked to be conscious about my feelings and responses to various things. 

These days I'm very comfortable hearing disagreeable political views without feeling any kind of way, no matter how sorely misinformed the person speaking is. Heck, sometimes they have a good point.... Anyway, I'll spare you the whining about how the media never seemed to give DT a break. He can fend for himself, he doesn't need my help, money, or kind words. This is not to say that I didn't think the media coverage wasn't very slanted, I just can't be a fare judge since I avoid the corporate media like the plague. 

&amp;nbsp;



**Enter the ""Q"" or ""Q-Anon"" movement** (some of them will correct you if you say ""Q-Anon""... lol)


Within a week of election day, I was in agreement with a friend who said that Biden has it because ""you can't recount burned ballots."" Perhaps this is a wild conspiracy theory. I'm not gonna try to convince anyone. What annoys me is, the amount of people who went along with the Q delusion.


There was a chance for Trump's side to be heard fairly on the 6th but due to the events I wont go into detail on, that didn't pan out. Then the Q-crowd continued ""Trump is going to"" or ""Trump has already declared martial law... they are now going to put the fraudsters on trial and hold a new election.""


As we got closer to the 20th, the ringleaders of the Q-crowd knew they were full of shit, so they began to back-peddle and update their narrative. 

On a positive note, I was in a ""stop the steal"" chat group. In the beginning, I was being called a ""Debbie downer"" by someone who kept posting various pipe-dreams. Towards the middle of January, this same person was sounding just like me...... and others in the group were whining that he was being too negative. The person meant well, saw the error in the dis-info they were consuming and revised their beliefs. This gave me a little bit of hope for others.


&amp;nbsp;

Then some weeks back my dad got off the phone with his brother and told me about some BS video that his brother told him to watch. So we both watched it. It was some fat British guy making shit up. Saying shit like ""Biden isn't the real president. He's currently at TV studio version of the Oval Office and Trump walked past the window and waved.""

Like what?

In recent weeks my uncle has revised his.. beliefs. I offered to bet 5 ounces of silver, but he didn't seem interested (I wanted to win an easy bet). 

He basically has a very fluid outlook on things to come. He's not committed to a specific date which means I can't give him a hard time when March 4th comes and passes uneventfully.


&amp;nbsp;


I kinda stopped taking notes and following this Q shit because you can't throw it back in their faces anyway.... they'll just adopt new bullshit when last week's bullshit doesn't pan out. I occasionally leave disagreeable comments on videos but am finding laughing less and less. 

So, that's basically where I'm at with this BS.",QAnonCasualties
830,"I’ve lost sisters, friends, and clients","I’ve JUST joined Reddit. I found this thanks to articles in Huffpost and Newsweek. 

I have certainly lost two of four older sisters to q. April 24th was the last I have spoken to one of them. My oldest sister and I have birthdays about a week apart in late October and early November. We exchanged birthday texts, but y text at Thanksgiving and Christmas went unanswered. I guess it’s partly my fault for blatantly calling out their descent into q “absolutely insane.” I just had no better way of dealing with it, and they wouldn’t accept my silence on our sister messenger thread. 

I’m a massage therapist and a medical assistant. I became a medical assistant during the pandemic I’ve been a popular massage therapist in my area for 9 years. If it wasn’t hard enough to be shut down for three months, the one extremely small and peaceful George Floyd/Breonna Taylor protest I took part in, caused some clients to leave me. Others left when they found out that I was going to get the vaccine against Covid. All are rabid qanon believers. 

It’s hard to even talk about my best friend. She almost walked away from our friendship. Actually did for two months, but I persisted. It isn’t the same, though we do try. The trying is effortful, where once it was effortless. Q is always the great big elephant occupying the space between us.",QAnonCasualties
831,My qmom sent me a disgraced doctors “letter to friends and patients on why I’m not getting the vaccine”.,"For anyone else is dealing with this letter that’s going around from a Dr. Shallenberger I wanted to share some details that may help you defend against the nonsense contained in his “letter to friends and family”. 
I received this copy and pasted letter from my Mom after casually asking her if she was open to the vaccine. The letter was full of misinformation and misconstrued facts and selective excerpts from news articles. 
I researched who this Dr. was and to my (not) surprise I find that in the early 90’s he was subject to multiple disciplinary actions due to ""gross incompetence,"" ""repeated acts of gross negligence,"" and ""acts of dishonesty and corruption which are substantially related to the qualifications, functions, or duties of a physician and surgeon.""  
He surrendered his medical license in CA due to this and now practices in NV. 
This alone should be enough to show someone that perhaps they shouldn’t trust this source of information. Not to mention his letter is easily disproved by multiple reputable news sources. 

I asked my mom, “would you go to this discredited doctor and let him perform surgery on you?? If the answer is no, then please also don’t spread or use his information.”

Hope this helps anyone also dealing with this stupid letter.",QAnonCasualties

They believe some of it, not all of it: think that Jan 6 was a disgrace and don't buy into the pedophile thing but they believe that the election was HIGHLY questionable, if not outright stolen, Trump is not great but still better than anyone else, and they'll probably still vote Republican. It's extremely frustrating because they're reasonable on some things, and we can have actual conversations sometimes, but then it's like I hit a brick wall talking to them and can't get any further.

When a magician does a magic trick they want you to look at one hand while the other hand is actually performing the trick.

Part two:
Qanon started on 4chan. 4chan was(maybe still is I don't know) a place were people would share CP. Qanon saying other people are pedophiles, they are trying to distract you from the truth that those members of Qanon are the real pedos.

Anyways feel free to critique my argument.",QAnonCasualties
837,Why I believe Qanon isn't going anywhere.,"I don't believe Qanon is going anywhere for the simple fact that people are using it to justify their views, prejudices, and warped beliefs they more than likely previously harbored before Q. I used to think it was stupidity and gullibility that was the driving factor of people flocking to Qanon, but I don't think that's  really the case anymore. These people are obsessed with believing in this satanic child killing enemy and throw out all logic and reason, and I think ultimately they really don't care if it's true or not, they literally chose the worst kind of evil imaginable and project it on anyone who has a different view from them, they no longer even have to entertain opposing viewpoints because well, they're literally evil. To them Qanon proves their ideology right, and it must feel good to know youre beliefs are right. 

My aunt who believes, was always subtly racist, now that she's found Q, she can openly hate BLM loud and proud all she wants now cuz to her its really a shill organized by satanic baby killers to destroy America, she no longer has to doubt that maybe she's the one in the wrong or even listen to what they are saying, 'beacuse its evil', and if it's evil she knows shes right. she gets to keep her slanted views about minorities guilt free, and her world still fits neatly in a box of her right and them wrong. Why is Qanon ripe with racism, antisemitism, transphobia, etc? Because its a means to justify those beliefs.
 
It's much easier to hate someone or be a completely terrible person to ppl if you believe they are child rapists secretly destroying america, or if they would support and/or are supported by child rapists. Thats why they obsess over it, it's not about saving kids, it's about everyone else being wrong/evil. Everything is still just black and white that way.

Not only all that, but they get to live in a fantasy world where they can easily champion themselves as the saviors of children and sex trafficking victims, nevermind they dont actually do anything to help anyone, to them they are actual patriots fighting God's fight, they're the good guys and the ""libruls"" are brainwashed by Satan himself, imagine how morally justified they must feel over everyone else, it's the biggest ego trip I can imagine.

No longer are other ideologies and beliefs subjectively evil to them, but they are truly evil and they have ""proof"" of it now. Anything their opponents do that the Qanon members don't like they now 'know' it's because they have evil alterior motives. It's a shield they can put up anytime to deflect anything they don't agree with. That's why it's not going away even after all their set backs, because they don't want it to go away wether its true or not. The ppl in your life who are obsessed with Q, are not obsessed just because they are gullible, factual truth and evidence aren't what they are looking for, because the truth is Qanon is the waters that vindicate whatever beliefs they previously held, and that is one hell of a drug.",QAnonCasualties

I am conducting research studies on the impact that QAnon has had on relationships and the social and mental health impacts that the QAnon movement has had people's lives. If you are a friend, coworker, intimate partner, or family member that has had a negatively impacted relationship due to differing beliefs and support of the QAnon movement, I'd greatly appreciate if you could take a few minutes to complete a short survey to describe your experience. 

[QAnon Relationship &amp; Social Impact Survey @ Qualtrix](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3m8qf25ha41PDa6)

The survey starts with 5 demographic questions about the QAnon supporter in your life, and then 10 questions regarding the relationship, social, and mental health impact that the QAnon movement has had on you and the QAnon supporter. It should take you no more than 10 minutes to complete. The survey is anonymous, and all information is completely confidential as no identifying information is ever requested.

This survey is one small part of a much larger study that I plan on conducting about this same topic. I thank you in advance for your time and contribution to my research!

842,QAnon is just Icing on My Mother's Cake of Crazy,"My mom has been radicalized for years now. My mother is a well educated black woman and I used to look up to her. When I was going from middle school to high school (I just turned 24) is when it all began. Videos showing men on corners shouting at people how sinful they were (Hebrew Israelites). She started staying up all night watching them. At first it was a dogmatic allegiance to Christianity then it shifted to allegiance to the bible. Now it's morphed into an incomprehensible mess of religion, thinly veiled Islamaphobia/anti-semitism, and of course a never-ending repetition of QAnon/QAnon adjacent conspiracy theories and black supremacy. Yes. You read that right. Black-supremacy. 

When I got into highschool our dynamic changed. I started resenting her. And not in a teenage ""she took my phone"" kind of way. In a ""my mother believes there is a race war coming and that white people will be enslaved"" kind of way. By time I had finished highschool our relationship was in shambles. November 2015, the same year I graduated high school, when Trump was elected she said he had saved the country from Hillary who was a closet lesbian, pedophile-cannibal who raped young girls then ate them, among other things. I've gotten progressively leftist in my views and my mother has fallen deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. 

I see a lot of people talking about experiences I know well. That shift from someone you love turning into someone you no longer recognize. My mother was never perfect. Emotional and physical abuse was always there on some level. But I never questioned if my mother was proud of me or if she loved me as a young child. And today, I don't question it either. Because I know she doesn't. Because she's made it clear she's repulsed by my ""lifestyle"" and I'm ""brainwashed."" I'll never forget the day she looked in my eyes and told me ""Don't ever wonder if I like you, I don't like you. I hate your personality."" I was maybe 18 when she said that. And I replay that in my mind to this day.

I'm getting married soon and I haven't told her about it yet. I don't intend to. I'm marrying a white trans person. I have no doubt she would highjack the whole thing, curse me out, and try to talk me out of it. ""Inferior blood"" and ""gender confusion demons"" became part of her regular vocabulary early on in the indoctrination. I don't tell her where I live. I don't see her anymore. She calls and talks in a one-sided conversation, where my role is to just say ""uh huh,"" otherwise I risk a fight with her. I don't tell her I'm in love or succeeding in organizations I've founded at my university. When holidays roll around I send her the obligatory text ""Merry Christmas!"" and she responds in kind.  I don't tell her about the friends I have or the traumas I've endured. When I had to deal with being sexually assaulted one of the first things I thought was, ""I can never tell her."" Because she went out of her way to tell me if I didn't stay within her religious protections I'd be assaulted. I don't know which would be worse: her taking it as confirmation to everything she believes and driving her that much deeper into conspiracy or her telling me it was my fault. I'm sure both would happen. I just... don't tell her about my life.

They now believe they are prophets predicting end times, BLM and Tom Brady's wife are satanic witches and the world is going to end. They've ostracized family members who helped raise their children because they don't share the same political/religious opinions (unless they want money) and have become unbearably judgemental, homophobic and pious. I think they know what they're doing is wrong as they dirty delete their dog whistling 'divine words of wisdom.' They've been on a raging anti-abortion stint for the longest (like shaming an elderly relative for having one despite being raped at 11 yrs old). The focus now seems to be turning to anti- environmentalism? I don't know, it's so fucking stupid and pretty enraging.

These Q folk may be healthy and self sufficient now, but when the time comes and they are unable to care for themselves they will be left struggling? Will they suffer alone still drowning in hate? Will they demand help from those they still ostracize? Will any of them self-reflect enough to realize they engineered their own hell? 

I've often observed that as people age they tend to either harden and become more hateful and rigid, or soften and become less judgmental and more loving. Q seems to have hastened the process for a great many. The people I've seen that hardened most also seemed to live the shortest (hate brings stress upon the body=stress is a killer), or the longest--like making it to 95-100+. It's like the universe keeps giving them another chance to have that ""come to Jesus"" moment and they keep failing year after year. 

I know it's morbid, but I live my life looking from the imagined end to the present. When I go, I want to know I spent my time being loving and kind above all. I just can't imagine going decades full of hate.

850,"Parents not yet in QAnon, but leaning towards it","I heard this subreddit I wanted to see if any of you could give me some advice. My mom is turning to it, she is not there yet, but I think I can see the writing on the wall. She already believes some conspiracy theories, like the vaccine microchip and the one where they think COVID-19 was made in a lab in Wuhan. l I have read some of your stories, and I fear that she might become a full-blown conspiracy theorist and not just that, but a QAnon supporter.",QAnonCasualties
851,Worried about my parents,"I want to start by expressing how relieved I am to have found this group but also sad how many of us have to resort to coming here to navigate this strange experience. 

Growing up my dad was a source of dysfunction in the household. He was addicted to opiates and a hard labor worker- coming home in terrible moods, I have many memories of my parents fighting or me being afraid of my dad. As a result I don’t have a lot of memories in my childhood due to dissociation. In my tween-teen years it became the worst. My parents would always have a cluttered house, unopened mail on the counters and whatnot, expect us to clean up their mess everyday after school, and when we didn’t (because what kid knows how to sort their parents unopened bills and mail?) and yell at us for not doing it. They never picked up their own mess and just expected us to do it growing up. My dad would also regularly use the n word, one time I was about 13 put on a pair of jeans and he said I had a n* ass. Always calling people the n word in his stories and he would even call me it like what’s up n-?? I am a young white woman and he is also white. I had to unlearn a lot of racist crap that I thought was okay after I moved out.

Bringing me to Q. When Trump won the election in 2016 I knew my parents were happy about it, my dad got a trump train sticker and a flag. Over the year I noticed he would play YouTube videos constantly, throughout the night and all day when he wasn’t working. Watching Fox News constantly. My sister and I always made it clear we don’t agree and when he talks about this, or anything that he feels he’s right about, he raises his voice and shuts us down, which is extremely triggering from our childhood with him. We are not able to engage in conversation with him about this.

All the while his Facebook is full of Q videos. His Facebook posts would say things like “drain the swamp” or he would end a lot of his posts with just “Q.”

Text my sister and I to stock up on necessities for shut downs that never happened. 

Before 1-6 he was posting in support of protesting the election. I don’t think he supports the violence that happened.

After the insurrection I stopped over and almost made it through the morning without bringing it up. He started talking about Facebook and YouTube censoring conservatives and I had already told him I didn’t want to talk about this with him. Trying to set my boundary. And this developed into him raising his voice about me being “LIED to” by democrats. He was crying (he does not blubber and cry over things easily) over DT being impeached, about the news portraying him and his supporters as terrorists, the look in his eyes completely broke me. I felt like the parent looking into my crying child’s eyes. It was horrible. I told him I’m not going to sit here and get yelled at when I told you I don’t want to talk about this. He stopped and agreed he shouldn’t be yelling.

He has deleted his Facebook, YouTube, and just shut down the family Netflix account to disassociate himself from companies that have denounced DT. My dad was already a paranoid, self isolating person before this and now I’m worried he is losing his sense of identity, isolating himself from the outside world and is probably on some conservative only feed. 

My poor mom just goes with whatever he does. They also don’t really make any effort to see us, hang out with us, they just care about their crappy jobs and politics. 

I’m afraid my dad will never swallow his pride and admit that this is way too much. He prefers this over a real, normal life. 

I’m trying to accept that I’ll never have a normal relationship with my parents. I love them and want them to be happy, but they are just fear mongers and unhealthy.",QAnonCasualties
852,Political ignorance and social apoliticalism enables Qperson abuse that rips relationships apart,"I want to preface this by saying that the way your Qperson is treating you is not your fault. Their destructive and self-sabotaging beliefs and actions are not your fault. It is who they are and you are not responsible for these inclinations.

I have seen a trend in the posts here, a pattern of ""when we aren't talking about politics everything is fine."" This makes me think of toxic, manipulative and abusive relationships where the victim cannot be convinced they're in an abusive relationship and keeps returning. We warn young people that their inexperience and naivete can lend them in an abusive relationship. I see this happening with the victims in this sub, where despite their (ostensibly liberal) personal beliefs, they opt for a socially apolitical lifestyle and end up in relationships with people whose political beliefs are wildly incompatible with theirs.

""When we aren't talking about politics everything is fine"" is the Qanon equivalent of abuse victims trying to convince others that ""when I don't upset him he's such a sweetheart"" or ""he loves me, really, so it must be my fault I upset him."" The only solution is to educate yourself on political matters and have those discussions. Vet the people you interact with and form relationships with. 

Their ideologies and behavior are not your fault, but please, please don't set yourself up for heartbreak by ignoring the importance of matching ideology in a relationship. You've seen how little it takes to push a Qperson over the edge into full blown conspiracy cult delusion.

I apologize for the ramble, as I am not a scholar on the matter, but it's a pattern I've noticed that I felt was relevant enough to point out. Social apoliticalism and political ignorance lead to much of the suffering Qanon inflicted on the people purely by enabling it to grow unchecked.",QAnonCasualties
853,Unpopular Opinion (Maybe?),"Disclaimer: grandparents have gone off the Q/religion deep end since elections. Other extended family is divided because of political beliefs.

Maybe this is just me, but I think that differring opinions are good for you. I am seeing a lot of people on here (and everywhere else) labeling entire groups of people because of the behavior of some, and I don't think that's the right way to go because then you're just doing the same thing these Q people are doing. 

I have many friends/relatives on the left, center, and right of US politics. I never judge them for their beliefs, nor do I judge my family for theirs. HOWEVER, I do think that *behavior* (whether rooted in politics or religion) is the biggest role in breakdown of relationships. For example, my grandparents think I don't want to talk politics with them because I'm ""becoming brainwashed by MSM"". I don't have time to watch the news, nor am I unaware of biases within them. I don't want to talk with them because of their extremely aggressive (and quite frankly, childish) *behavior*. They have essentially cut off anyone who doesn't go with their theories and spend all day on Facebook (which is now an echo chamber since they unfriend anyone who disagrees). Disagreement is healthy when you can be civil, no matter how ridiculous something (non-violent) may seem to you. This idea that ""If you aren't on my side, then you're bad and I hate you"" has gone way out of hand and it's isolating or alienating many people. I think we all (assuming the majority is sane) have beliefs in common, no one is 'better' than another person for their personal perspectives.

Maybe we should stop judging and labeling each others' opinions and politics and just judge people by their behaviors. I refuse to let opinions/politics/religion become my main course of judgement and as a result, I am exposed to a wide variety of different people, cultures, beliefs, etc.. Exposure is what helps us understand each other. I don't really know why we all have to resort to moving somewhere ""because it's blue/red"" or believing that one place is good because its isolated from blue/red .

That's just really my opinion. I wish more of us could be civil and focus more on similarities than differences, although I do understand why many feel the need to get away from people who cannot do so. My mom, who I moved away from, frequently berated me and wished death on me because of my political views (she wanted to use my vote for her candidate, I refused). My dad and his family were just racist and intolerant towards me (he is a naturalized Korean, and I am first gen half American half Korean). None of them ever called me by my name but instead a Korean slur for ""half-breed"" or ""mongerel"". I don't have any contact with either of my parents because of their radical behavior (and many other reasons). Like I said, I will respect your beliefs, but the respect has to go both ways. Giving ultimatums and freaking out about someone's opinion is really just nuts to me at this point. I read a lot of posts on here that I can unfortunately relate to, and I genuinely hope that all of you find peace in your life, whether that means going no contact, distancing, or apologizing if you have done the same thing a Q person did to you. 

Ok end of rant lol.",QAnonCasualties
854,"I don’t know if my husband is Q but if he’s not, he’s Q-lite","Background: He frequented T_D then went to TheDonald.win which is now Patriots.win. I know this because he told me, and that all the banned subreddits were getting picked up by them. I can’t tell if he really believes that there’s a pedophile ring amongst big money democrats and celebrities or if he’s just entertaining the conspiracy like he would UFOs at Area 51. He’s been a Trump supporter since his nomination. Before that, he was into Rand Paul as a hard libertarian. You know, “taxes are theft” etc. 

We fell in love shortly before all the primary politics of 2015 started going down. Before then, I only gave a cursory glance at politics. I had liberal social views that drove my voting but I didn’t really read about it past specific social issues. So at the time, I didn’t care if we had different politics. It had never been a big issue before for me to be different in politics than someone else unless they were ultra social conservatives (of which he was not). 

I didn’t really pay much attention to the primaries. I watched a debate here and there and rolled my eyes as I watched a reality tv star running for nomination. Like many people, I never took him seriously. I thought people would vote for Kasich because he seemed like the only adult in the room. I guess that shows how ignorant and naive I was then. We ended up moving in together 6 months before the RNC nomination convention in the summer.

When Trump got nominated, he started rooting for him. He was one of the “he won’t be the same when he gets into office, he’s just doing it for show” and “I just want to shake things up in Washington”. We debated hotly the whole rest of the election and when Trump won, I cried. I cried because my (at the time) boyfriend didn’t see why I was so upset that this guy got elected. 

For months following, I obsessively followed Trump on Twitter, trying to show my husband that he wasn’t changing even though he won. He said “oh the game is still on, wait until after he gets inaugurated”. So I waited and hoped. He still didn’t change as we all know.

So we fought at each other’s throats for the next two solid years after that. It was the only thing we would ever fight about was politics. Everything else in our relationship was actually great. Our day could be going great and then current events would cut in and it would dissolve into a nasty fight. We couldn’t ever seem to have a discussion because I was so passionate about the issues brought up (think kids in cages, Kavanaugh hearing, etc) that I would see red. Each awful thing Trump said or did or caused was explained away somehow or whatabouted. I logged onto T_D every day just to lurk and see what they were feeding my husband. I still get on TheDonald.win which is now Patriots.win occasionally so I can know what frame of mind my husband might be in. 

Finally, we both realized that the subject of politics was destroying our relationship so we both finally stopped talking about politics. I deleted all of my social media so I could just stay away from the news and only check it once every couple months. Our relationship improved leaps and bounds over then2 years after that. We got married, bought a house and added twins to our family. 

But now I’ve been drawn back into the daily grind of politics and the fresh realization that my husband still visits Patriots.win. That my husband thinks the election is stolen, that my husband actually tried to brush off the murder of a capital officer by saying he died from an embolism. That my husband has “joked” about pedophile rings between top Democrats and celebrities. 

He’s not as far gone as some, at least when it comes to some of the much deeper Q conspiracies. He doesn’t bring up his Trump politics, he’s never worn or purchased MAGA merchandise, there’s never been a Trump sign in our yard. In fact, meeting him you would never guess in a million years that he supports the same guy that the people who stormed the capital support. He’s an amazing dad and really a great husband to me. I tell myself often that I should really just be lucky that the only problem in our marriage is politics but other times, I wish above all else that I could have the amazing marriage without the stain of Trump/Q. When Biden won, many were celebrating on the streets or just at home, crying from happiness and relief. All I could do was stare at the screen numbly, objectively grateful Trump lost but unable to pull up those emotions because my husband thought the win was a fraud. 

So I asked him, if States and Congress certify results and Trumps lawsuits go nowhere, will you finally accept the results of the election? He said yes. But now even though he acknowledges Biden as President, he still thinks the election was stolen from Trump. 

I just want this man (Trump) out of my marriage and I don’t know how to kick him out. I will keep fighting for my marriage and I do truly believe that I’m the reason my husband didn’t fall completely off the deep end but I feel like he’s hanging on by a ledge and I’m hanging onto his wrists for dear life.",QAnonCasualties
855,My cousin is changing and it's making me incredibly sad.,"I know this isn't the worst problem to have by any means, but this is genuinely starting to make me sad. My cousin and I are SUPER close; we have basically grown up together, talk all the time, etc. We are now in our early 20s and our friendship, just like many others, has really been tested due to the fucked up year that was 2020. I genuinely still love her, but she has recently started saying some things that really make me question why her opinions are changing so rapidly, and in the exact opposite direction of how she used to think. I totally believe that changing your mind, forming new opinions, etc. is great but some of the things she says have no basis. For example, her boyfriend voted for Trump (she voted independent) and I told her at the very least, that means he is okay with the racist, xenophobic, bigoted things Trump has said. She immediately turned it to Biden, saying he's racist too. I responded by saying that I know Biden isn't a good person, and I'm sure he's racist as well, but because of the messed up two-party system we have, I went with the lesser evil. Then she said, ""Did you know that it was actually Hillary that colluded with Russia in 2016?"" I asked her for a source and said it's literally been proven that the collusion involved Trump and Russia and she went on to say I have to look deeper, not use news stations as sources (which I partially agree with, they are all biased), etc. She still has not sent me anything to prove that the collusion involved Hillary and says she needs to research it for a couple of hours before sending me a credible source. She also says Trump did not incite violence on Jan. 6th. Another example- we were talking and I brought up how double-masking is now being recommended. She said ""No thanks"". She thinks it's weird that NOW the CDC is recommending two masks. I tried to explain that this is due to multiple strains being discovered but it falls on deaf ears. I also tried to explain that obviously what we are told is best to protect ourselves is ever-evolving because there is still so much to learn about COVID, but she just doesn't want to hear it. She says she isn't going to get vaccinated because it doesn't seem safe, but she's been vaping for years (and obviously there's very little research on vaping and its effects) so that somehow makes sense, I guess? I'm getting worried that her boyfriend is influencing her opinions because I know she has been parroting his views more and more. I really don't know what to do, I told her it's concerning to see her going down this path but she says that's not true. Obviously, she's her own person and I love her no matter what, but it's making me so sad to see it happen.",QAnonCasualties
856,The reason why Qanon isn't going away.,"I used to think it was pure stupidity that was the driving factor of people flocking to Qanon, but lately I'm starting to realize it's probable worse. Thse people are obsessed with believing in this satanic child killing enemy that they've concocted, and I think ultimately they really don't care if it's true or not, because the truth is it's just a reason to justify their already shitty behavior and beliefs. Take the Conservative Christian crowd thats flocked to Q, they can now easily think of themselves as champions of saving children and sex trafficking victims now, nevermind they dont actually do anything to help anyone, but to them they are actual patriots fighting God's fight, imagine how even more morally superior they must feel over everyone else, it's the biggest ego trip I can imagine. Even worse than that Qanon is ripe with racism, antisemitism,homophobia, transphobia, etc, it draws those people in like a magnet, even if those views were kept private before Q, they can now use Q to express them and not only be justified but feel honorable in it. My aunt who believes, was always subtly racist, now that she's found Q, she can openly hate BLM loud and proud all she wants now cuz to her its really a shill supported by satanic baby killers, she don't have to listen to their struggle and maybe grow as a person, 'beacuse its evil', and she gets to keep her slanted views about minorities guilt free. It's much easier to hate someone or be a completely shitty person to ppl if you believe they are child rapists secretly destroying america or if they would vote for and support child rapists. Thats why they obsess over it, it's not about saving kids, it's about proving all their previously held fuxked up beliefs were right. Uncle Earl from the trailer park whose spent a life time of stock piling guns and hating the libruls, now has a place to fantasize about murdering them because in thier minds they are no longer subjectively evil, but they are truly evil and they have ""proof"" of it now. Anything their opponents do that the Qanon members don't like they 'know' now it's because they have evil alterior motives. I know a lot of you have family and friends you've lost to Q like I have but, honestly at this point in the game, I don't think the majority of Qanons are just stupidly gullible, or that the majority are just good people trying to save the children, I think the majority of Qanons are probably shitty people justifying their shitty beliefs. That's why it's not going away even after all their set backs, because they don't want it to go away wether its true or not.",QAnonCasualties

861,"My covid denying mum got covid, still denies it.","(The main subject of this post is not Qanon related however it very much links in)
I’m in the UK, London, born in Poland but this is my home for 15 years now, around 20 for my mum. Me her were never really that close, I moved out as soon as I could at 18/19 and now in my 20s were started trying to re kindle our relationship but it’s been very tough and slow. A couple months back was one of the first times I feel we had an honest and open conversation as adults about everything, (ideals, morals, beliefs, politics, relationships, race) and all that conversation did was create more divide for me. I realised how differently we think and it honestly scared me. The distance and time between us allowed me to really grow into my own person. In one conversation she told me how: 1) Covid is fake/just flu, government tracking you and all that bullshit, anti mask/ vaccine 2) We spoke about American politics (during the race) and she clearly showed great support for Trump (as much as she tried to hide it and play it off) at the same time accusing Biden of numerous dumb things, mainly the usual pedophilia. 4) Mass consumption of nonsensical media (Facebook) aka. believing anything at face value, never questioning your beliefs and calling someone brain washed if they ever question you 4) Very skewed perception of race and  racist tendencies which I just can’t tolerate, especially as my girlfriend is half black and it’s a massive part of her, she’s passionate about race issues and is an activist. I’m very proud of her and to be with her. My mum has met her but I’m now ashamed to put my girlfriend in the same room. These are the main points but overall I see now we just don’t see eye to eye on many things and at the age I’m at now I’ve developed strong integrity, there is a lot of subjects in this world I refuse to compromise on, (unless I’m proven otherwise of course) family or not. WHAT YOU CAME FOR: A month after this conversation I messaged my mum asking how she is and she told me she HAD covid and she now recovered. I warned her about the danger of it and the importance of wearing a mask and how irresponsible she is, so honestly speaking my initial response was basically a ‘I told you so’. To which she responded that she had Flus worst than this and it wasn’t that serious. Stating that Covid is not mortal. She lost me at that point and I wrote her like 5 big essays of the problems I have with her and her beliefs( For another time). The thing that really hurt me the most, is that she was clearly prepared to die before telling me. I could have lost her because of her ignorance and stupid sense of pride. This ignorance plague is actually taking lives and my mum was lucky to get away. That was one of the final if not the final straws for me. Family honestly means nothing to me but blood, I don’t want an ignorant biggot in my life, no matter what. She’s very hardheaded and I always felt like conversations with her it’s just a matter of who ‘wins’ or shouts louder and I never entertain that, I’ll rather stay quiet because if I try speak rationally explain where I stand I’m laughed at. It’s not my job to to make her realise this as son, it’s so draining to listen to and this was only one conversation. I can’t even imagine what it must feel for you guys out there who have to endure this every day in your homes, and still be strong enough to think logically and not fall into this conspiracy hole. Sorry for venting for so long, I could definitely go on for longer but I just wanted to share my story and I was happy to come here to see others are experiencing the same (equally terrified). This may not have been specifically on the topic of QAnon but I feel this ties in to how people like my mum are so easily influenced by the shit fed to them, often from sources with nothing to back it up and pure speculation and more importantly the impact it had on their loved ones, friends, colleagues. If anyone bothered to read this whole thing I’d appreciate a few words in the comments to direct my thoughts a bit, as they seem to be all over the place.

862,Where do we go from here?,"I’m new so I’m sorry if this is inappropriate or has been addressed elsewhere.  How do you “forgive and forget” an abusive recently-former Qanon family member? 

It’s not so that my brother was substantively wrong (but yeah) as it was the smug bullying and wildly inappropriate behavior over the last 2+ years.  How do you “unsee” that and wipe away those awful experiences? 

Trying to ignore it or hope it was going away didn’t do the trick. It just got worse over time.  Eventually, it developed a counter/response. Because it had to; and that got very ugly.  Now the fever seems to be breaking.  But there isn’t any laughing it off and just shaking hands. 

I’m not looking to repeat the abuse he heaped on everyone and I don’t want to make family get-togethers awkward. I just really don’t want anything to do with him anymore. I can’t see that that will change. I don’t know if this is hate.  It seems almost beyond that.",QAnonCasualties
863,Q husband,"This is my second post now. Although my husband and I are separated due to Trump, Q and conspiracy beliefs, he still comes round to see me and the kids. He left today after a discussion, not an argument, because I made sure I didn't raise my voice. All I was trying to do was get him to see how he has been putting his beliefs before his family. I know that they expect something big on 4th of March, there's a few things circulating some that think Trump will be inaugurated on that date, others that believe he is still President and Biden has been cloned. My husband believes that Biden didn't really get inaugurated and he is acting in some studio. He also believes the Queen is dead and that her Xmas speech that was televised in the UK was fake. We were supposed to be all going away as a family last weekend but he started his nonsense by text with me during that week so our weekend got cancelled. I let him know today that his son who is 13yrs actually doesn't care if he sees his dad again as he's sick of the way he is upsetting me, so he is now turning that on me, saying I'm trying to poison his kids against him. All I have tried to do is encourage him to see them more, and for all of us to do more but he just can't see this. So again he's walked out instead of apologising to his son for the way he has let these things come first. I'm trying to stay strong now and I have blocked his no. and let him know the kids need an apology and he needs to start putting his family before his beliefs. I'm not holding my breath though.",QAnonCasualties
864,How prevalent is this amoung your Q's,"  

I have a dear friend who I met whilst i was a university student, and he is my ""Q-affected"" friend. For the sake of ease, I'll just call him K. As a student, I used to spend a lot of time in a certain music/dive-bar, and this is where I met K. His family is very blue-collar, while my father was a professor, so we're from very different backgrounds, but we're still good mates. I don't think his home-life was very stable as he was growing up, and he's got very severe ADHD. He takes medication for this, but he also abuses it like hell. He also smokes a lot of pot, and when we were living together a million years ago, he used to take hallucinogens a lot (and I do mean A LOT).

Pocking around the net I've seen anecdotal reports that mixing pot with ADHD meds can trigger psychotic episodes. K's always seemed ""off"" if that doesn't sound too mean. You can tell there's something different about him as soon as you speak to him, but the last few years have been terrible! He's become something else. For a time, he was living quite close to me and his mental health was just spiralling down out of control. He also got me work, for which i was very grateful, but i was stuck with him day in day out. He was always forcing youtube clips under mys nose (some were flat earth, some were really racist in a truly bizarre way, others were about aliens ... they were ALL stupid).

On July 3 2019, K and I caught up for a drink, and to smoke some pot (yes, I know, I'm a fucking idiot!). He was talking to me about some Q-shit involving the bible. Because i did some units at uni to do with comparative religion, philosophy and classical-studies, K's always asking me about this shit. I'm kind of hyper-secular, but I've always been interested in that kind of thing, and so i know about it. He got very animated about me dismissing it, and was saying that how was he supposed to know what it said (we were speaking about Revelations). I said he just read it himself and gave him an old bible. I know with hindsight that this was a stupid thing to do, but it made sense at the time: I was trying to drop the topic, and thought he'd only glance at before throwing it aside when it wasn't what he expected (he'd done that with Gilgamesh two months earlier).

I assume people here are familiar with the whole July 4th 2019 thing, but just in case, that was when JFK Jr was supposed to reveal that he was alive and start the storm. So apparently K went berserk, because he was arrested and put into psych. He has few friends left, so it was me who had to go in and visit him every second day or so and escort him around when he had leave and stuff. It was really full on. His family moved him back to closer to home, so i don't get to see him as much but I've heard he's doing (marginally) better. He still thinks covid is a scam, but he said something about not believing in Q to me a while ago.

The thing is that reading these posts has made me think that maybe my friend isn't as typical as i thought. It sounds as if most of the people here with q-affected friends speak of people less obviously-deluded than K; people who are capable of owning and running a business etc. Now that K's closer to home he can't smoke as much weed as he likes, and they've changed his medication which had him bouncing off of the walls. I'm hoping that with time his brain-chemistry will equalise and he'll be okay again, but I'm not holding my breath. Are other peoples' q-friends drug-affected and/or got overtly-obvious mental health issues?

Also, I feel I'm missing some detail that prehaps i should understand about the whole JFK/Revelations thing? Does anyone understand that? it just seems a little disjointed, like the two don't belong in the same ""theory"".",QAnonCasualties
865,My mom was a Trump supporter who left the cult before she could get into Q. One of her friends who was mentally ill and in Q just committed su*cide. What can I do to help?,"Basically, my mom is still conservative but is starting to think for herself.

How do I help her to cope?",QAnonCasualties
866,Alternate reality,"My relationship wasn’t in great shape before the past year, but over the past 8 months or so my spouse has gone down the Q rabbit hole. All she talks about is the cabal, the pedophiles, 5G, election fraud, vaccine, etc. Sometimes I can calmly say “I don’t agree” but sometimes, like tonight, I blow up and tell her how ridiculous it all is, how so many of these theories are just such obviously false and politically motivated. She then accuses me of talking down to her,  not taking her seriously...but she insists that we talk about it, but I am not really allowed to disagree. All mainstream media is evil and part of the plot. Fact checkers are “bullshit.” Only YouTube and BitChute, oh and of course MyPillow guy...when I pointed out his “panel of scientists” included two ophthalmologists she went off on some tangent about how of course the production values etc are low because these people have been forced out/cancelled. I’m like “but wait, isn’t this just a billionaire trying to overturn an election, just like you claim the fucking “cabal” is doing, but actually for real?” Ugh. I know I’m ranting - I feel like I have no one to talk to about how this makes me feel. I just hope she doesn’t somehow brainwash our kids.

867,"My dad isn’t into Qanon but he reads a ton of Breitbart and I think he might be pulling my mom into it, should I be concerned?",I used to be extremely conservative but I started to shift this year when I saw how my side reacted to Covid and the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd.

868,Pregnant and miss my parents. Today I saw them and made peace with estrangement.,"Just want to share the story of my parents, and how I'm at peace with them being out of our lives after seeing them today. 

Cw: sexual abuse. 

They were hippies back in the day. Happy people. I remember 9/11 being the big event that changed them. Made them increasingly suspicious, anti-social, and occasionally bigoted. 

My mom was the one to listen to fringe conspiracy people like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, while my father was Mr. Rational. A very Romney republican. They bickered here and there. I remember them fighting in 2016; my mom loved Trump, and my dad thought he seemed like an asshole. But that didn't last. 

The Trump era really changed everything in our family. They began seeking out more and more fringe content that spun and deflected from valid criticisms of Trump. Dad went from a ""let's give him a chance, he's a cool businessman"" to ""he's literally the savior of American culture!"" Our house became decorated in Trump flags, hats, fridge magnets, and stickers. The TV was never off. Always on Fox, then Newsmax and OAN. It was surreal. 

But last summer, as the 2020 election approached, they both started getting into Q. 

I tried to pull my dad back (he had previously mocked QAnon) but it was like the more I tried to reason with them, the more they clung to it. My dad's boss was holding Q meetings late at night, with people skyping in from across the country. They went shooting in the forest near Canada to ""prepare for civil war"" with a group led by a couple veterans. They invited my husband and I over for movie nights but then played us Q youtube videos. They blew up at us when they found out we were planning to vote for Biden. My mom essentially said, ""How can you vote for a pedophile like him when I was raped by my father as a child?"" 

By the election, I wasn't speaking to them aside from the occasional small talk phone call.  

Then the Capitol attack happened. They were thrilled and I was horrified - by the attack itself but mostly at their joyous response to the violence. As my dad started texting me instructions to ""prepare for martial law"" and stock up on ""emergency food supplies"" I had to cut them off entirely. Distance wasn't cutting it. Unfortunately I did so through text, but I knew a phone call would get me emotional. I essentially told them that their addiction to Q and the violence was shameful, and I didn't want it near myself, my husband, or our new baby. 

Since then, my mom has sent a few emails to podcasts and websites about the ""cabal,"" I assume trying to red pill me. I've ignored them. Got a new phone number too. 

Today we stopped by their house to get the last of my things from their basement. Old paperwork and business suits, that kind of thing. We had called ahead to be sure it was okay, and was curtly told yes. Saw the dog. Saw my old bedroom. Saw them. Most of the Trump paraphernalia was gone. 

But they were so cold. They made no attempt to hug us or smile or... Anything. Resentment was all over their body language.  

And here my dumb ass had been missing them. Wondering if in the last month something had changed or they'd come to their senses. So many times I've wanted to call and give baby updates or ask for advice or just reason with them. 

But there I was, their daughter, 37 weeks pregnant in their kitchen and it was like they didn't care. Like they've chosen Q and Trump over me, and over their granddaughter.

As we drove the hour back to our house, my head was flooded with small memories I'd mostly forgotten - or maybe pushed away. Racist side comments they made when I was a teenager. How, when I was going through puberty at age 11, my mom told me all men will find me sexually appealing and to be careful - even around my father. My dad confiding in me when I was dating my husband that us being together wasn't a good idea because he's Black and society will target us. Them trying to convince me not to move to Japan and then again the UK because they're ""dangerous"" countries full of propaganda, socialists, and terrorists. 

These comments seem so obvious now, but they were sandwiched between their good aspects, their personalities and hobbies. I overlooked them because I could.

I thought far right media and Q had taken my parents from me and brainwashed them. How else could children of post-WW2 immigrants, Jewish and German, believe such anti-semitic, fascist crap? 

But no, they weren't brainwashed. 

Q puts together all the things they wish were true. It gives them justification for the hatred, bigotry, and fear they used to make an effort to conceal. It makes the violence they want to see somehow righteous. 

I miss my dad. I was always a daddy's girl. And I wish my mom were around to help me give birth and be a mom myself. 

But my daughter deserves better grandparents than them. My husband deserves better in-laws. And I need to stop making excuses for their toxicity, hoping they'll change. It's their own responsibility.

And I think I'm finally at peace with letting them go. I have chosen family that have stepped in with love during what should be the happiest time of my life. My childhood best friend's parents are helping us prepare for baby, and my mother in law checks in often and is ready to come help at a moment's notice. We have great friends who have found a way to be present, even during an endless pandemic lockdown. 

If my parents can't be part of that and prefer Q, so be it. I'm done shedding tears over their choices. 

Thanks for letting me share and vent this here. ❤️",QAnonCasualties
869,My Sister in Law is refusing to let me see my nieces and nephews over “politics”.,"I haven’t been able to vent about this. I can’t speak about it to anyone in my family for fear she will find out and tighten the reigns that much more on what is already a strained relationship. 

My sister in law and I have never really seen eye to eye. She doesn’t have respect for me. She lives off playing “Devil’s Advocate” in all posts I make on social media and she uses it under the guise that she is “making me defend my point”.

This past month she took it too far, again.

I freaked out over the transphobic, racist, homophobic posts that were being made from several of my old friends from my small town in Wyoming, so I flat out said I don’t fuck with the above personality types and if you couldn’t possibly be in my social media presence anymore, feel free to delete me. 

She then sent me this long gaslighting text about “what if her kids disagree with me? Would I cut them out too? Would they feel the need to change their beliefs just to please me?” This is not the first time she has used my love for my family against me, and I lost it. I had a full on panic attack and blocked her number after she told me she no longer wanted to see me post pictures of her kids on any social media platform. 

She also threatened to leave a bad review on my FB business page because she scrolled back four years and found a photo I had forgotten to delete. 


I have a twin niece and nephew who turn 1 on March 16th and because of the Pandemic I haven’t even met them yet. I cancelled my flight out there next month because she told my brother if I came there she was going to pack the kids up and leave with them. She is not well, dealing with having fallen down a hole of conspiracies as well as an untreated bipolar disorder. 

Has anyone dealt with this sort of thing? I would love for some unbiased opinions on how/if I should proceed on trying to fix anything. I’m truly heartbroken and at a loss.",QAnonCasualties
870,Nesara Gesara,"First let me say thanks to everyone who post comments and their stories in this group. This is my first post as I’ve read close to a 1 million (seems like it) entries of the same story of individuals that have fell victim to a significant other buried in the qanon sewer.   My wife is one of the most caring,  selfless individuals I have ever known in my life and has literally become a different human being actually wishing for the death of John McCain an old man Bush (a few years back) to hurry up and take place so we can find out the truth about things involving JFK.  Gritting her teeth in anger as she tells me she’ll be so happy when they’re both dead.   
She’s been involved with Q from the beginning.   She is one of these folks that will never let go in fear of how she will look by embedding her self in all of this garbage and doubling down to not be foolish.  (Pretty sure that’s not working)
I would never point a finger and say I told you so, but we are at a point way past just someone being ignorant.  This appears to be a giant mental health crisis that targets the emotionally vulnerable and gullible.   

I can literally tell stories for many many  hours as I’m sure all of you can.

My wife is real big on this financial reset aspect of Q anon. I haven’t seen it mentioned in any of the posts I’ve read and I’m curious is anybody is familiar with the Nesara Gesara    As I understand it it’s one of the oldest Ponzi scheme‘s that it tends to attach itself to any crisis of significance going on in our country.  My wife is telling all of her family,  in which most of them are believers, that there’s going to be a financial reset in which we’re all going to be loaded. Our money is going to be backed by precious metal again and our checking accounts and assets are going to be revalued which could make them worth 5 to 10 times what they currently are. She has our daughter and son-in-law convinced JFK Junior is alive and is behind this and helping the push.  
She keeps telling them every year to wait till the last minute to file their taxes because the IRS is illegal and going to be going away, the banking system is illegal and going to be going away forever, the media will be gone overnight one day, amongst many other things. 

DJT has signed Nesara Gersara in place and will be activated when the new election inauguration takes place in March. I Can’t Even!  

In addition there is an inter-Galactic being called Ashtar who he and many other  peaceful aliens are living and walking among us and helping DJT run things. 
She goes to sleep every night listening to Ashtar YouTube videos.   

At this point the Q army believes absolutely anything they are told and I cannot even get my mind around 1% of the garbage they treat as gospel. I imagine in my mind a table full of hackers in Russia or China sitting around drinking beer joking about the next conspiracy they can put online that Q people will attach themselves to. Currently JFK Junior, Elvis Presley, Princess Diana, Michael Jackson are all alive and well. JFK Junior is coming on the scene any day now to expose himself, and his dad too,  who would be well over 100 years old.   This is so cultish. 

I could go on for hours, but I appreciate this forum and honestly is one of the most civilized ones I’ve ever seen on the Internet. I appreciate everyone’s respect level and courtesy as there are many many hurting people who’s family, friends, &amp; loved ones are completely enshrouded in this ridiculous movement, with no end in sight.

872,So happy I found this group,"I came across this page because of a Huffpost article about families who’ve been torn apart because of Trump/Qanon. Like so many of the families in the article, my mom had made a complete 360 from the woman I’d known my whole life. 

My mom died from kidney cancer in May 2020 - a crazy story because she had been in remission for 20 years when it came back in 2016 and more aggressive. When that had happened, she had gone down a rabbit hole trying to find natural “cures”, buying expensive snake oil (what I’d call it) and there was no changing her mind about sticking to science and what her oncologist recommended. She was convinced chemotherapy was a Big Pharma conspiracy with doctors to make money and have the FDA not approve these so called cures she was finding. I blame her friend that was a huge conspiracy theorist and from there, my mom drank the koolaid. 

When I found out she voted for Trump, I was astounded. I would get so pissed when she’d talk to this friend on the phone about all the bogus conspiracy theories and regurgitate all the bullshit from Trump. Since she was sick, this should’ve been time to take full advantage of what we had left, but instead I felt our relationship was more strained and weak. I’m an only child, and she raised me as a single mother, so she’d been my rock my entire life. 

I would get so irate when I’d try to find understand why she voted for Trump and one day I told her I’d lost so much respect for her because of it. She was like a stranger to me and I didn’t know what to do anymore. Now, I hold a lot of guilt because of what I said and because we weren’t close before she died. There was a quote in the article from a loved one saying, “I hate Trump because he took my mom away from me.” And that’s exactly how I feel. It’s all so heartbreaking.",QAnonCasualties
873,Feeling like I've lost my mom,"My parents are conservative Christians and have been lifelong Republicans but never really talked about politics much when I was growing up. They both voted for Trump in 2016 but would still talk about how they cringed at some of the things he said. 

Over the past 4 years my mom has grown closer with a friend of hers who is an obsessed Trump supporter--buys his wines, sends my mom Trump bears, etc. My mom never had many close friends as an adult and has completely latched onto this friendship and I think that is part of why she's now obsessed with Trump as well. At the beginning of Covid, my mom was taking the virus seriously but by July she was traveling with this friend to Vegas and acting like it was all a hoax, despite my boyfriend's uncle dying of it a month before. They even went to one of his super spreader rallies and the first Million Moron March in DC. 

Over the past year my moms words and actions have gotten more alarming. She sent me the Plandemic video to watch, blames everything on ANTIFA, believes the election was stolen, said the Nashville Christmas Bombing was to destroy dominion computers stored in the AT&amp;T building, and made comments during the BLM protests that she ""wished someone with a gun would go out and shoot them all"". She also later on told my brother about the power outages theories and a few other bizarre theories that he didn't even want to repeat to me. I got in countless arguments with her over all of this but tried my best to not engage to keep my sanity. We live on opposite sides of the country so it wasn't in my face 24/7.

On January 6th she posted praising the insurrectionists calling them all patriots and that a ""sleeping lion had been awakened"". I deleted her on all social media and told her over text message that I no longer wanted any kind of relationship with her, that she was in a cult, etc. She told me to ""stop drinking the koolaid."" Irony...

A few days later she posted on Facebook saying we need a new civil war and went back in forth with a guy in the comments about how veterans will be on their side, how they all have guns, etc. Since I was no longer FB friends with her, I only found out because multiple people screenshotted it and sent it to me because they were concerned and asked me to report it to the FBI. I don't think she would act on anything violent but at this point I feel like I don't even know this person so I just reported it to be safe. An FBI agent ended up contacting her and talking to her on the day of Biden's inauguration and she lost it. She ended up figuring out it was me that reported her by going onto my email (I didn't know she had the password) and finding my emails with the agent. She told my brother that she knew it was me but has not confronted me yet. She instead keeps doing little things to try to get a rise out of me to start an argument so she can bring it up but I've just been not engaging at all.

I have such a strong feeling of guilt over this because my mom has always been very emotionally manipulative and raised me to be extremely dependent on her. She would get jealous if I had friends in high school, wouldn't let me get summer jobs, always bought me things to hold as leverage in arguments, etc. She didn't talk to my godmother for 10 years because she told her that we needed friends other than our mom. I think it's ultimately a good thing that I'm being forced to be more emotionally independent now but it's really difficult for me since it completely goes against how she raised me and I feel like I can't even talk to her now.

It honestly feels like my mom is dead because I don't recognize her anymore. I don't even know how much of a Qanon follower she is because I have virtually no relationship with her anymore. I know this post is long but it feels good to write it all out and I wonder how much others can relate. It makes me so mad when I think about how many families these lies have destroyed.",QAnonCasualties

875,A long road ahead,"Like many millions of others, I have lost friendships because of Trump and misinformation like QAnon.  Lies hurt and lies destroy relationships.  It affects us all whether you're one of the brainwashed or the observer of a delusional friend or family member. 

How do we recover, as humans, I mean?  How do we reign in the lies and regain the trust we used to have in our institutions?  Why DO people think the main stream news is not to be believed? What makes them think that professional journalists from all over the world are colluding to feed us all untruths?  They've lost trust and they'd rather believe a monster like Donald Trump or the enigma of Q. Once they've made the choice it's difficult bringing them back. 

Whatever we do, we cannot convince them of the truth. We must be patient.  Time is the great healer.

Am I ever going to get my best friend back? And if he leaves Q or Q ends and leaves him, what is he going to be? Is he ever going to think logically? Can he think logically anymore? Brains are weird and they don't just bounce back. 
It is like people regress when they get into Q hard core. They lose rational thought, they act immature, not respecting boundaries both personal and social. They lose a lot of self control.

882,"My Family is Q’s Judge, Jury, and Executioner","I suppose I should have seen it coming when I announced that I supported the BLM protests last Summer. They verbally abused me for over an hour right then, swore at me constantly, insulted my intelligence, my personality, pretty much everything I was until they left me crying in fetal position on the floor of the kitchen... and then they turned around and said that they had done all of it out of love. 
Because of course you have every right to traumatize your grown son and reduce him to nothing as long as you call it “love”.
That was a half-year ago. They’ve only gotten worse. My father is constantly soaking up whatever lies Newsmax and OAN leaves for him, yet remains utterly complicit whenever the subject is discussed, hardly ever speaking at all. In that way, he’s almost playing the neutral party, never approving but never disagreeing either, just going along with every little thing. I’ll label him the judge by that logic.
Corresponding, my mother is the jury: she gets to decide what stays and goes, what’s real and what isn’t, what’s considered truth and what’s considered blasphemy. She’s been on a rampage recently. She’s gutted our extensive family movie collection because she thinks that Hollywood consists of Satanist pedophiles. She’s broken the family budget and cluttered up our already-too-small house my buying way too much food to stuff into pantries we don’t need, all in the name of “preparing for the End”. She’s driven away every friend of our family we’ve had for several years with her rhetoric. I won’t even get into what exactly that rhetoric is; you probably already know. 
Finally, my brother is the executioner. He is fully and completely willing to cause harm to defend his Big Lie. He says so constantly. Every chance he gets, he just loves to harp on about how much better America would be if we simply ordered a Nazi Eugenics-like killing of all trans people. Or if we ordered the genocide of all Muslims in this country. Or if we abolished the Democratic Party in favor of a neo-monarchy led by Republicans (which would be fascism, of course, but to him that’s a good thing). It might be mostly bluster, and he might not be as strong as me, but he does have access to the family gun...
Suffice to say, I’m planning on escaping to a college campus when the next semester starts in Autumn. It’ll be on the other end of my state, so it won’t be particularly convenient to them to try and chase me. I’ll be sure to leave a note telling them that I haven’t been kidnapped, so as not to give them an excuse to get police involved.

He lives several states away, so we don’t see him very often, but to our surprise, we got a rant sent to us via text about a month before the election that we were cop-hating, antifa BLM supporters who didn’t understand that the Proud Boys were saving the country. This was shocking and obviously very upsetting, and we haven’t had much communication since. We are trying to figure out how deep he is, and I started to suspect he was hearing Q type of content as well. Is there a lot of overlap here that anyone has seen?

884,Broken hearted mom...I've lost my daughter,"I've been going through all of the posts here and I'm somewhat comforted by what I'm reading.  Unfortunately, 90% of the posts are about kids who have lost their parents to Q.  I'm a mother who lost my best friend/daughter.  She and I were like 2 peas in a pod.  We talked every day, got together with our whole family (there are 15 of us) for every birthday, anniversary, graduation and, really any other occasion we could turn into a celebration!   I'm a Democrat.  She became a Republican when she married her husband, who I adore(d).  We NEVER had so much as a disagreement about politics.  It was a ""non-issue.""  At least it was until 2015.  Her change started shortly after Trump announced his run for the presidency.  She started with ""Pizza Gate"", then claimed that Bill and Hillary Clinton had Vince Foster killed, as well as Seth Rich.  It just went downhill from there.  Conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory.  

The last time we actually spoke was in Aug.2020.  We hadn't seen each other for a while, so I called to invite her to Starbucks for coffee.  The first 30 minutes was fine - just small talk.  Then, she brought up Barack Obama who, by the way, she had voted for in 2008.  She mentioned something about his middle name, Hussein, being a Muslim name.  I realized at this point where the conversation was headed.  We had already had ""the birther"" conversation in 2015.  I wasn't going to have it again.  I stopped her &amp; said, ""We're going to have to agree to disagree on this.""  Then I stood up, hugged her, and said, ""We need to set boundaries in the future. I don't play the 'conspiracy theory game. I have to go. I love you. Bye.""  That was pretty much it.  I haven't spoken with her since, although I did hear that she, her husband and 2 teenage kids went to DC on 1-6.  I don't think they went with the intention of getting involved in the violence, but nothing would surprise me.

885,Dealing with my Spiritual/Wellness Q Sister,"This is going to be relatively mild compared to what a lot of people have experienced, but I appreciate the opportunity to get it off my chest.

I don't want to break any rules about sharing articles, but if you want to google it, it's ""The Unlikely Connection Between Wellness Influencers and the Pro-Trump Rioters"". I didn't realize that my sister was most likely deep in Q or Q-adjacent shenanigans until I read this. She used to be a nurse working in emergency room/trauma centers. She took a swift right turn about a year and a half ago and suddenly was very into the spiritual and wellness community on instagram. Quit her job and moved out to AZ to create videos/posts that promoted her particular brand of feminist-led spiritual health and wellness. Not for me but I like to think I'm supportive. 

In the beginning of the pandemic she made a few posts about not needing to wear masks and how your aura can protect you from covid, a little disappointing to read to be honest. Around August 2020 she announced she was selling her possessions to car-camp full time. Interesting but ok. After some more questions, she announced to the family via group facetime that 1) 5G is for microchips and any covid vaccine will have a microchip in it B) on Nov. 3rd they will shut off phone service and electricity nation-wide and C) there will be a real life purge as the Democrats revolt against DJT's inevitable win. The cherry on top was that she had ""received all this information within a 24-hr period"" and that is ultimately why she feels safer if she were camping out in the woods when all that goes down. 

She has always been very careful to not pick a political side out loud (as a few members of our immediately family are very left-leaning). She has never once said the word ""Qanon"" so I'm not sure if she even realizes where she is getting her info from. I truly don't think she supported DJT, she believed she was just warning us of what was inevitable.

Nov 3rd came and went and yes there was some tension and confusion across the nation, but none of the things she claimed clearly have come to pass. A final prediction she made was to share a video with the family in which a well-known wellness guru (and I guess political commentator) explained how a Real Civil War might still happen because yet again Democrats won't accept DJT's win when the election results finally shake out. We all know who was declared the next Pres and what happened on Jan. 6th and she has been radio silent about politics ever since. She will still occasionally post things to her instagram such as ""just because someone thinks differently than you doesn't mean they are a conspiracy theorist"". But again doesn't claim to be a part of Q and I don't even think she knows the true source of the claims she was spouting. 

I hope she is in the clear as I have not heard anything about March 4th from her and she has returned to a nursing job for the time being. I'm all for finding your niche and sharing it with others but there was a brief and scary pivot into Qanon conspiracy territory that I just hope she has been able to pull herself out of.",QAnonCasualties
886,Are they mentally ill?,"So I'm brand new to this sub and I'm sorry if this has been discussed before. 

I was finally diagnosed and began treatment awhile ago, but I have bipolar disorder as well as obsessive compulsive disorder.

In the early 2000s, I became obsessed with the 9/11 and peak oil conspiracy theories.  I was spent countless hours scouring the internet reading everything I could about the ""truth"", and wouldn't shut up about it whenever I talked with friends and family. My worldview for a period of time had changed drastically,  and I was obsessed, it had drastically taken a toll on my relationships. 

The stories that I've been reading on this sub mirror my own life  from when I was undiagnosed and unmedicated. Is it possible that many of your Q people have serious underlying, undiagnosed mental illnesses and that's one of the main causes of their behaviors and QAnon obsessions?

887,I Do Not Feel Safe Inviting My Mother To My Wedding,"I've heard of this Reddit forum before but since I'm not a very active user on this website I had never checked it out until now. But I feel bad constantly crying on the shoulders of my friends who have their own problems to deal with. So I'm going to post here, mainly to get this off my chest.

I am planning on getting married in May after a decade with my partner, and postponing from 2020 due the pandemic. We are endeavoring to have a safe, socially distant, healthy wedding. I am encouraging everyone who is able to get a vaccine beforehand to do so. (I have pre-existing conditions that allowed me to qualify for the first phase in my state, and have already received my first dose.) Now, I understand that not everyone will be able to get the vaccine by May but I have helped a number of my friends who qualify, and their elderly family members get vaccination appointments over the past couple of months. I'm endeavoring to help at least 80% of my guest list vaccinated before the wedding. This will not be a superspreader event, not on my watch.

Now we come to my mother. She is eligible for the vaccine but she refuses to get it. For years I have watched as her conservative leanings have become more and more extreme. She is fully indoctrinated into QAnon at this point. She is constantly spouting propaganda and conspiracy theories at me and will not listen to a single thing I say. She refuses to get the vaccine, or even consider wearing a mask to protect others. 

Nothing has caused me more pain and stress during wedding planning than my mother. Not the pandemic, not the health concerns, not the fact that we had to postpone and change all of our vendors, not the amount of money we are spending, not the fact that I still don't have a dress, or any of the other things that are reasonably giving me anxiety. 

Because on top of all of this, I've had to deal with numerous texts, messages, and e-mails from my mother over the past several years telling me how I've been ""brainwashed"" by my liberal education (that I went into debt to obtain because she was never willing to help me) or by the media. She seriously thinks that I'm part of a Marxist/Communist agenda trying to take over the country (because I am technically a member of the horrible ""media"" that she hates so much and I'm also very much a leftist). She constantly proclaims that we just ""shouldn't discuss politics""  but takes any excuse to rant at me about her abhorrent alt-right beliefs and how I'm the hateful divisive one, not her. This includes almost every conversation we have had about the wedding. 

For years she has been emotionally abusive, and manipulative. But she still thinks she has the ""right"" to attend my wedding and that I should bow down in submission to her simply because she is my mother. Last year I bent over backwards to secure a (very expensive) new venue with lodging simply so she could stay there on Friday night (she converted to Orthodox Judaism over a decade ago and cannot drive on Saturdays). 

Recently I told her that she could not come to the wedding if she wasn't vaccinated. In some attempt to ""compromise"" she claims that she'll get a Covid test before traveling to Pittsburgh. But even during that exchange, she was hurling abuse and alt-right propaganda at me. Putting me down, rewriting history, making herself into the victim, trying to guilt trip me, gaslight me, and emotionally manipulating me into doing what she wants. I wanted her to be there because she is on my only living parent. But I don't want to risk the lives of my friends and partner's family by having her in attendance. 

I just don't know what to do. I tried to cut off contact with her five years ago after the election and I was a fool to reach back out to her and think that she might ever change. 

I already took her off the guest list after the last hateful rant she sent my way. That was after I tried to give her a chance to condemn the actions of the insurrectionist mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th. But she just doubled down and started spouting rhetoric and propaganda at me once again, belittling me and saying terribly cruel things about who I am as a person, because I'm a ""baby-murdering liberal."" 

Just this week she tried to wheedle her way back into my good graces, but that of course quickly devolved into the same old fight. Nothing I have ever said gets through to her. She doesn't listen to me. She doesn't respect me. There is no regard for my boundaries or my wishes. She claims to love me ""FOREVER"" but what kind of love is this? Her involvement with QAnon is paired with her long history of abusive and manipulative behavior. I have begged her to seek therapy, so she has someone to talk to who might be able to help her understand how much this is hurting her children. But she will  not listen to anything I say. 

Additionally, she does not seem to understand that my issues with her stem from her beliefs and her involvement with QAnon. And that her attitude about the vaccine is only a symptom of a much larger sickness that is living in her head. 

So that was my rant. Thanks for reading, if you took the time to do so. I'm sure there are others here who have similar stories. Any advice would be welcome.",QAnonCasualties
888,Qanon Orphan,"I'm so glad I found this. It's helpful to read the stories and heal on here, if that's even possible rn. Honestly I don't know. I noticed my parents going batshit crazy for the first time roughly a little over 4 years ago. They've always been anti-government and weird, but that alone didn't seem odd at all. As time went on they started telling me things, that even though I had not thoroughly researched the topic, I knew right away something was off. Like normal, smart people, especially the ones I looked up to and was raised by, don't say this bs. I brushed it off for a while and thought, ah mom must have read something weird online NBD. A couple more years went by and I started recalling the monthly predictions and irrational BS they had been spewing for years. I told them their track record at predicting literally anything was terrible. Nothing they had ever been consumed by or warned me about over time had come true. Then along came Q. I learned about it and could go back bs story by bs story over the years verbatim. I was shocked. I could also find the meme or false information going around and predict what they were going to say next. No one was ever held accountable after something they said would happen didn't happen. But don't worry, next month it will, or next fall, or next summer. It's always down the road. The goal post always moves and the cult lives on. I started having conversations with my parents explicitly about the stories they were telling me with a ghost white sincerity in their eye, and showing them how easy it was to debunk. I showed both of them several times step by step how to check multiple sources on anything to prove if it was real or not. I warned them about the places they were getting their information (blogs and YouTube University). I also told them to be careful about everything they saw on FB etc. They just listened and then told me they don't trust Wikipedia or mainstream media. Any of it. So they had successfully dodged my educational debunking seminar. They told me about the Cabal and pedophile rings, specifically ALL of the Democrats and Hollywood Elite and how the President was a ""brave hero"" akin to Jesus/God. President's word was gospel, and really Q. Besides that everything is wrong. I argued for years. I debunked for years. Being raised religiously I shuddered at ""their"" idea of religion considering who they worshipped. It had nothing in common with Christianity or it's principles. I reminded my parents that pedophile rings exist in all organizations around the world in different places at different times and there was no ""secret"" about it. I realized that all the things they had been saying about Democrats over the years that was completely insane came from these memes and Q blogs. I mean, party aside, really crazy shit. I bit my tongue through ""the government is tracking my phone so I have to turn off the gps"" and the ""I use an untraceable browser so they can't see what I look up"" and even the ""Government is controlling the weather/Chemtrails"" phase. Still not sure why the last one was even created, but hey why not. I started avoiding conversations with them. I wanted to salvage what, if anything that was left of our relationship. I sat through the ""5G"" and the ""Microwave poisoning"" and the "" Blue light from technology "" glasses that they wore. I really didn't know what to do. So Covid comes around and naturally like any good Doomsday prepper would do, they informed me that ""Martial Law"" was unavoidable and I had to always have food and water and a full tank of gas and hey, why don't I just come hide where they lived to escape it for a little while. I argued and got verbally abusive, because I knew they were FULL OF SHIT. Being recently unemployed I decided I could go for a little while. I have many other siblings. They were only able to scare one other to come up. So nothing happened. The trip was stressful and my ability to avoid or stay quiet around my parents was becoming impossible. I left. My parents don't believe Covid is real. They are anti-masker anti-vaxxer Qanaons. Even after all of the Medical professionals and immunologists etc share their knowledge. Even after my sister had it and was hospitalized and has long lasting effects because of it. Even after I've had 8 friends lose someone in their family because of it. Even though my dad is or ""was"" a medical prefessional and so are 2 of my siblings. I've lost my mind with this. I had been telling my mom respectfully for 2 years on a weekly basis, ""Do not send me messages or include me in group messages that have anything to do with Politics or conspiracies"" It never worked. I had to block her number. I had to get verbally abusive and yell. I have tried as an adult human being to gently and respectfully explain the TRAUMA that I experience when they spew the Q to me. As a growing older child I am learning how to love myself and reduce toxic relationships. I DO NOT call my parents because of this. I have tried everything. I have tried to talk. My mom turns into a defensive child. She still doesn't even know what the hell is going on. Their behavior has REAL WORLD effects on people, including her children. All of them have distanced themselves. I am the only one taking a stand. I realize I speak from a place of privilege, growing up with both parents, trust me. I said ""goodbye"" to them last year. My mother blames me, thinks I am being too harsh. I've been sober for 15 years, and my mom even tries to compare it to all the shit I put them through with my drug use and years. If this is payback, I'll take it, sure but I have to show tough love. I haven't even been able to tell my parents about my personal life for 2 years. I know I am validated in my actions, for my own protection at this point. I am in survival mode in my personal life. I am alone. I never thought the internet would take my parents from me.

I am curious, when did you learn about qanon? Do you deny their legitimacy due to their association with trump, or have you always disbelieved what they say? And my final question, would you be able to digest their claims if they ever were proven true?

Anonymous has been around a very long time. Qanon is said to be a far-right conspiracy theory but I don’t think it’s valid to place them ‘right’ or ‘left’. 

There is a lot about this virus that doesn’t add up. People dying from it said it wasn’t real. Nurses in overflow hospitals say it’s not as contagious as it’s promoted to be and there’s no clear standard of who is and isn’t vulnerable. Governments have historically done what the conspiracy theorists claim they are currently doing. Pushing for globalization, centralized global government and economy, taking clothes off our backs that we don’t have to gain foothold in other countries in need, I mean the proof is in the pudding..

The history of how the Holocaust evolved from an election to a genocide corroborates well with what has happened in the past year. Czechoslovakias civil war fits the amount division the media seems to be pushing on us. 

Mind you, conspiracy theorist are not against you. They’re against people who want to take advantage of our country as a whole. They’re against a government who has clearly been manipulating us, and the world overall, for centuries. They’re against the times that our leaders committed genocide (and they have, refer to Native American history). Propaganda is very present in our media, social media, communities, whether your right or left. Black or white, citizen or alien, gay or straight. 

Just think for a second why you don’t believe the theories. The people who convince you they’re fake, are the people who have the most to lose if you believe them.

898,Hi! Here on anon account. Wanted to share our family's story.,"
I'm white, female, 40, married with two kids, and a SAHM. My husband and his family are all conspiracy theorists and I've been really lonely for the past four years. I don't have family close by and this was a nightmare for me. 

My husband and I both voted for Obama and were on the same page when we met in 2011. We married in 2012, and were able to talk calmly about politics. 

2016 my husband became a different person. Suddenly he started becoming meaner and more distant and very rigid in his thinking. He stopped helping out with chores and started spending alot of time online. Then he started talking about Q. 

He is a Redditor, and I do blame Reddit for this partly because Reddit is where he got his content. 

Politics became a hot button in our house. He got very angry at being questioned and started a narrative that I had TDS, Trump Distortion Syndrome. Any kind of discussion inevitably led to a fight. He stopped parenting, and became a fun time dad who didn't feel he had any responsibility toward normal things, like homework, dinner, cleaning.... He started groping me at odd times like when I was distracted and kept saying that by withholding my breasts I was alienating him. 

When that was met with distaste on my part, he blew up, and that became his personality. Everything became my fault. His parents moved to Florida? That was my fault. The laundry piling up? Also was my fault. Literally he was able to blame me for almost everything. 

His narrative changed again and suddenly it became his job to keep everyone in line although he himself slept in, didn't cook, didn't clean, didn't help with the kids, and spent all of his time online, only running to talk to me when Q made another drop. Finally, I asked him to stop talking about it and to find something else.... that something else became video games. 

He became a person I didn't know and he still is. I thought that Bidens inauguration would snap him back out of it, but it hasn't. He was absolutely a mess the day of the capital riots and became angry, vengeful, and the emotional abuse kicked up yet another notch. He still believes the capital riots were necessary.

 Finally I had to get his family involved because he refused to go to counseling and was sleeping all day and being awake all night. He started ruining my sleep cycle and I became so exhausted I couldn't mentally or physically function and became a shell of myself. I would try to take naps during the day, and he would sleep until 1 and wake up after the kids were gone to school. I would be trying to rest and he would literally bust open the door turn on the light and demand sex. 

I am now so uncomfortable around him that I avoid him during the day and generally as much as possible.

QAnon, you can have him. I do not want him anymore and our marriage has dissolved into a pile of shit. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 

He realized how abusive he was being and now he has shut down. That's fine with me because I don't want to talk to him anyway. 

I handle the parenting independent of anything he does. I now have taken on his chores and my own and there are no thank yous. None are expected. He's allowed to live his life on his own terms because now none of his bullshit makes an ounce of difference to the day to day living of our family. He can read his theories all day and that is his new life. 

The only thing he has successfully kept going is his job. If he loses that, I'm taking the kids and leaving him. 

Hopefully QAnon will let him keep that at least.",QAnonCasualties

Totally new to reddit, just reaching for a support group over the alienation and isolation I've felt more and more since Trump's inauguration and much more so since the pandemic began.

I've always been close with my mom.  She and I have always debated politics.  Though we disagreed on policy, you could call politics one of our go-to subjects.  That began feeling less rewarding and/or engaging when Trump won in 2016, but has become intolerable since 2020!  

We live in two totally different realities.  There is nothing I can say that she doesn't brush off as my being brainwashed by ""MSM"" (main stream media).  There is no proof I can provide her that she doesn't deflect as coming from a lying, deep state, or otherwise compromised source--this happens regardless of providing her news articles or primary sources (government reports/data, transcripts, etc).

She spends her time consuming alternative media, giving her alternative facts, creating an alternative reality!

While we used to speak almost daily--hours throughout the week--I've talked to her 2-3 times in 2021.  Not at all since the inauguration.

901,Odd connection,"First time posting here and I apologize if this is long winded or odd.

I ran across an article about folks losing people they cared about to QAnon.  I have heard of QAnon but never thought anything of it as I have no interest in hearing what they have to say.  That being said, my brother joined a cult and moved to Mexico a few years ago and I did a ton of research on that cult in order to get him to see reason.

Fast forward to today when I read the article about QAnon.  There are a number of similarities to the cult my brother follows and QAnon.  While I understand that the whole cult mentality is to use fear and confusion to gain followers, there are things that make me think they are linked and perhaps being ran by the same group of people.

The thing that caught my attention was the mention of lizard people.  The cult my brother follows believes that there are also lizard people that have put scales over our eyes to hide the truth.  I havent done research into the amount of cults that believe in lizard people but it seems obscure enough to raise a red flag for me.  

I am not going to give the full background of the cult because I do not want to give them any more attention than they are already getting but the cult was started by a man name Raymond Lear.  Long story short, there was a weird light over a temple in Jerusalem back in 2011 and that was when he was turned into ""the Lord"" and now goes by lord ray-el (who is supposed to be Jesus).    


Doing some digging, the group from Baja Mexico as been out of contact since the begging of January due to being on a ""special mission"".  Perhaps it is purely coincidence or perhaps it is correlated.  The group like most cults, is all about power and money.  One of my brothers jobs in the cult was to reach out to embassies and consulates to let them know of ray-el's return.  I cannot help but wonder that perhaps combining religion and politics would get them more followers and more money.  The way that they use fake new to push their agenda is also super similar.

906,"For those that see marriage in a religious light, how do you stay with your spouse?","For some religions, marriage is a sacred thing and ending that via divorce is like a last resort sort of thing. Both of my parents are Christian and my mother has literally lost her mind to Q. She’s not the same person my dad married nearly 30 years ago. 

Both of my parents are Christian and believe marriage to be holy, but I can see they’re no longer happy with one another and I’m pretty sure divorce is in the cards if my mom doesn’t straighten out. I’m not just speculating here as I’ve heard from both of them how unhappy they are on different occasions. 

From a biblical standpoint, do you guys consider this an exception to the “marriage is unending and divorce is not an option” rule? My mom isn’t the same person that dad married and it’s causing them both to be unhappy.",QAnonCasualties

909,On the Brink of collapse with my Q-ish Mom,"I have to get this off my chest. My mom is a Evangelical Christian who is also Q-ish. She believes some of the things but not all of them. Her neighbors are hardcore Q. I have not physically seen my mom since 2020, Due to the fact that her neighbors genuinely scare me, (they're so far down that if Q said to do something dangerous towards liberals they would do it.) even though I have known them since I was a baby. They absolutely think that I am the devil that I am the enemy...And they are clearly influencing my mom. I have gotten to a point where I haven't spoken over the phone to my mom since January 7th and I've had to create hard boundary lines about discussions around politics. It didn't go that well however she is adhering to my boundaries and has not brought up any conspiracy theories, politics or religion through text since January 24th. After the capitol riots She started spewing conspiracies about the capitol riots and sympathizing with the domestic terrorists. Its infuriating because when BLM was protesting her initial reaction was to get mad that the protests sparked looting at Target... I know..beyond backwards &amp; racist... It's very frustrating because she claims to be an Ally, But does not show that, it's very hypocritical and hurtful as I am in a long-term relationship with a POC. I'm just very sad and frustrated and my dad who is married to her still, &amp; is a logical person, kind of enables her because he doesn't want to deal with it either. he backed me up in my boundaries because he also has those boundaries with her, And is definitely the only reason why she is adhering to those boundaries right now. However I know that it's isolating her and I know that could spark her to get deeper into Q. I'm just very frustrated and sad, ashamed an embarrassed to call somebody like that my mom. I almost cut her out of my life completely, and am still on standby if she tries to break those boundary lines. I'm just so angry that Q and Trump have destroyed my relationship with my mom. :(",QAnonCasualties

My mom like many of the other peoples Qperson in this form join the q train years ago, and has always been into conspiracy theories. However, it was not until recent years that she truly lost her mind. And today I lost mine. Yet again, she sent me a link to yet another documentary with evidence showing how you know everything she says it's right except this time it was to do with my field of research. I told her that it was poorly researched, it had holes in it, and that there was just no real evidence there, and she told me to have an open mind and for some reason that was enough to just trigger me to have a full-on meltdown and lose my s*** on her. I feel horrible because I know that being angry isn't the way to help these people understand that they're caught up in a trap and a cult basically, you know we're supposed to be calm and patient but I don't know how to be calm and patient anymore. Like I truly believe that she's just stupid and unintelligent at this point. Recently she's been on about how YouTube and Instagram and Facebook and Twitter are censoring these people and how that means Communists have taken over and we fallen into a communist government and I tried to explain to her that these are kind of like private businesses, like these are people's websites and you agree to their terms and conditions when you publish content on their platform and if it doesn't fall in line with that it gets removed.You know just because you're into q doesn't make you special! Like hell, it's not like a woman can post photos of her breastfeeding online either! and I tried explaining this to her and she just wouldn't have any of it and I got more and more angry with the fact that she just can't see sense or reason on anything. she says she's into being open-minded and how we have to look at what everybody says but she will only listen to these prophets on YouTube and I even tried to explain to her that they're probably making money off of her anyway with all the views that they're getting. Sorry, I'm super frustrated and I'm really tired of her just being a f****** moron. I'm an academic and she basically just believes that I bonded to the system therefore everything I know is wrong.

918,Dealing with Loss of Single Parent &amp; Almost All Family After Giving Birth,"Joined this group after reading about it in a Huff Post article yesterday. I’m an only child to a single mother, I only have two aunts and one cousin. After January 6th I have been estranged from everyone in my family except my cousin (also struggling with her parents being Q sympathetic/extreme proTrump/conspiracy theorists) and my grandmother who is the only older adult in my family I am able to justify continuing to have a relationship with despite her believing Trump is a saint sent to save everyone due to the fact she’s so old and may not be around much longer. 

I just had twins last year so it’s been really difficult not to have my mom around because she was such a good mom to me when I was a child. 

After January 6th I gave my mom an ultimatum- you can continue to be addicted to conspiracy theories or you can have a relationship with me and your grand babies. She literally chose conspiracy theories. The more I think about it, the more it hurts. And then continued to talk about how sick it is of people (antifa according to her) to dress up as Trump supporters to storm the capital. I had been talking to a therapist for a few months before this trying to learn coping skills to make it all make sense and try to navigate boundaries in a different type of relationship with my mom. So this was the final straw. 

I knew things were getting bad when she literally brought her computer with her to my twin sonogram appointment last year and was Facebooking sharing conspiracy theories and pro-Trump propaganda from the waiting room.

They are genuinely shocked that Covid-19 simply hasn’t gone away yet because the election is over.

We even have an aunt who is on her deathbed and they refuse to wear a mask to come visit her.

One of their biggest arguments against Covid-19 being a hoax is that they don’t know anyone who’s had it (which is a lie because other family members have).

I really think the only thing that will snap them out of it is if they themselves get a particularly rough case of Covid-19.",QAnonCasualties
928,I have a kind of peculiar situation.,"My mom and my oldest sister are clearly both long into q. Their beliefs are getting more erratic, (though they were always a bit strange) ranging from the idea that trump was prophesized to win the election, to biden is a satanist, power outages incoming, the military will help trump (somehow they will take down pope francis in the process), and the capital raid was done by antifa bussed in and paid for by joe biden. They are storing bags of rice now in case of some ill defined food shortage.

So you would think that she is getting more mean and hostile in the process of getting more into Q... but actually the reverse is happening. 

I got married three months ago. My family is largely white with german background, but my wife is vietnamese. But my mom instantly started treating her... nicer than she does to her own kids. She goes out of her way to make her feel welcome, has never said anything ecen vaguely directly hostile to her, and went out of her way to help her plan a chinese new year party with my family, which is something we obviously never did before then. And she even wanted to find videos to teach my nieces and nephews about it so that they would be familiar. My mom acts afraid to even make her upset, and will change the subject if she is starting to say something she thinks is upsetting her.

As for me, I get the indirect benefit of the fact that she apparently doesn't want to do anything to *me* that might make my wife upset. A huge change from how she treated me a year ago. Not that she was always hostile, but more than she needed to be for sure. She still acts passive agreasive to me about political things, but now usually ends it and moves on faster.

Now, obviously Q is not what is making her nicer. But its just a bizarre tension with the fact that she is getting nicer at the same time as her beliefs are getting crazier. (And believe me, they were already crazy).

Since its not making problems for me, I would just wait for it to blow over... but there's an issue. She is trying to spread her craziness to my nieces and nephews. Openly telling them that antifa attacked the capital and the media are covering for them. My nieces and nephews' parents are conservative. They aren't as extreme, but... they are conservative enough that they will bend over backwards to avoid challenging any conservative slant. Even if they aren't quite Q, they don't like challenging my mom, and even worse, don't like challenging conservatism. So they seem to be in a place where they'd rather avoid talking politics with their kids, and give only the most vague of an indication that my mom is going too far, since they don't want to challenge anything my mom tells them is some type of core conservstives belief. Its a wierd situation.

So my mom and my other sister are basically trying to brainwash the kids into Q. I don't want to challenge her much too directly since she is acting nice, and my abused-by-her-own-family wife really needed a close family replacement. So rocking the boat isn't a good option. And she is long past the ability to actually care about evidence. (Showing her bad stuff trump did in the past is met with the excuse that he used to be bad but is a changed man). 

I can't try talking to the kids too directly, since my ability to get time with them is largely predicated on not bringing up anything their parents don't like. Politics and religion being a core one. No one in my family knows my exact politics, but for that reason most, be they left or right are a little suspicious of them. I just use it as an opportunity to avoid pointless arguments. 

So I'm in this kind of peculiar position. How can I keep the kids protected from Q nonsense without it looking like I'm talking to them about politics? For that matter, how can I get my mom out of it without it looking like an agressive challenge? The kids range in ages from 6 to 16. But they are all fairly sheltered.",QAnonCasualties
929,180 Degree “Values” Change,"Got in an argument with my girlfriend last night regarding her 180 degree “values” change. We’re supposed to be celebrating our 6 year anniversary on the 17th.

I stopped watching political news and reading politics on Facebook because it was consuming me. I couldn’t handle it anymore. She continues to do so and was “groomed” by her sister.

I should also point out that I believe in truth, science, and rational thought, as well as in social acceptance but fiscal responsibility in government, and am registered as “undeclared”. I read journalism that is well researched and void of opinions so I can form my own.

I’ve been trying to talk to her about this stuff since just before the election when “the change” happened but I keep failing miserably! I get too excited and judgmental and now she won’t even read letters I’ve written disproving these completely irrational beliefs she has. I’m still in shock because she never said anything about her beliefs on these subjects before. I feel blindsided and betrayed because I always thought we had the same beliefs on these matters and she always seemed as revolted as I was about what was happening.

934,Worried My Dad is Falling Into Q,"I apologize for the length here—I really need a place to get this off my chest. I feel like I’ve been holding this in for months. 

My father has been quite conservative since I was a kid. My mother is more liberal, and my siblings tend toward libertarianism—meanwhile I’m very left-leaning. Through high school and into college, my dad and I disagreed on a lot, but we could discuss it (sometimes at length!). I felt like he valued my thoughts and listened to me. We live in a rural area and I think my father doesn’t make friends easily. He’s often turned to online groups for company. 

Over the last five years he’s taken a slow dive into theories and rhetoric that sound more and more Q-adjacent: cracks about the Obamas, George Soros, and transgender “agendas.” Trump could do no wrong. The past year everything ramped up. He’s said things like “I don’t think that the virus is all that bad;” regarding my aunt (who has diabetes, and is very careful about COVID as a result) he tells me “She’s scaring herself about COVID.” He wears a mask, grudgingly, but says things like “I’m a free person.” And he seems to really believe that the election was stolen in a mass conspiracy by the Democrats. I recently found out that a close friend of his attended the Capitol rally in January. When I try to discuss things with him, he brings up statistics and talking points I’ve never heard of, which all seem to be misleading or misreported when I dig into them afterward.

 I feel cut off from him—we’ve talked less and less, and while I miss him I also feel that nervous twisting in my stomach when I think about calling. I know his and my mother’s relationship has suffered, which worries me too. And my father and I work in the same line of business. We have many connections in common; he introduced me to several business partners and friends—all of whom want nothing to do with QAnon. I feel terribly guilty even thinking these thoughts, but I’ve wondered more than once if I may someday have to reforge those relationships or lose them to awkwardness if they find out about my father’s leanings. I’d love any advice people might give me. I know that arguing doesn’t work, but I’m desperate for any strategy.",QAnonCasualties
935,My Dad Knowingly Gave Covid To My Whole Family(including me),"My dad has been massively radicalized towards Q, and generally the conspiracy right for the last four years, and he also cannot stand being told what to do. I’m 18, but I live at home for the time being since my college is close by. 

So naturally, when lockdown started, he refused to enforce our state’s mask mandate in his business. My mom is a nurse, and we both had huge fights with him over it(she’s into conspiracies too, but nowhere near as far gone). No matter how hard we fought, no matter if I refused to speak to him or the fact that this nearly ended his and my mom’s marriage, we could. Not. Get him to put on a damn mask at work. It was a huge victory when he’d wear one to the store. Eventually, we sorta forgot about it, since he became more distant as I revealed that I...you know...took the pandemic seriously and all. Eventually, I ended up in the car with him around New Years, and he called his secretary(and sister...who’s probably even more into Q than he is) to tell her he would be in late because I was having car trouble. 
Well she sounded HORRIBLE, she could barely talk and she was coughing every other word. I told her that she needed to leave immediately, because she was obviously sick, but dad cut me off and said “we need her in for a meeting today, I don’t care if she’s sick or not”. Dad went to the office, and then my family saw my grandma for New Years.(she lives very very close to us and I didn’t want to go, but when you live at home with a very “we’re the parents and you’ll do what we say when we say it” family there’s not much you can do) 
As you might imagine, dad was coughing his lungs up the entire time, and I tried my hardest to avoid him, but two days later I started coughing too and mom generally felt like crap. 
For context, mom has a preexisting condition(type 1 diabetes), dad’s lungs are shot from years of heavy smoking, and my grandma was finishing up recovery from a knee replacement. Mom was able to get tested immediately since she worked at the hospital, but I waited a day since I had so little energy I couldn’t drive myself. In the day we waited, mom came back positive, dad refused to get tested, and CONTINUED TO GO INTO WORK. He told mom that she “wasn’t really positive” because “the hospital gets paid every time they get a positive test” and that “[my name] won’t test positive because she’s being tested by the health department” 
My results came back positive
He shut up pretty damn fast about that
After this, we all assumed that he just had covid, because we had to get it somewhere, and begged him not to go to work and spread it further, but he claimed he was fine, and that his work was more important, so he continued to go
Mom almost divorced him over this. 
She should’ve 
Skipping ahead to the end of my contagious period, I ended up in the hospital because of how short of breath I was. Since I’m 18 and they wanted to do some kinda high demand tests on me, I ended up staying overnight in Pediatrics instead of going to the emergency room. Because I was in Peds, dad was allowed to stay with me(because he would’ve ended his contagious period before me, and mine was over) The doctors were great, but he insisted on borderline yelling about his conspiracies the entire time(it was around inauguration day at this point, so he was gearing up for some violent bs I suppose) and hoo boy did he have some problems when the doctor told me he had received his second shot that day. 
The doctor while trying to make small talk asked me if I planned to get the vaccine, and my heart sank. I had been avoiding talking about it with dad for genuine fear of being kicked out, but I couldn’t tell the doctor I didn’t.
So I told him the truth and said as SOON AS POSSIBLE, the second I could get in line I wanted the shot, because holy shit covid sucks and I never want it again. 
Dad was pissed at me, and after I got home(tests came back okay, no heart or lung trouble, working on getting an inhaler cause breathing is still hard almost two months later)  he gave out my number to all his work buddies so they could send me vaccine conspiracies and Q stuff. 
I’m an 18 year old woman...excuse me if I get angry when my dad gives my number to strangers more than double my age to harass me. 
I had come to terms with really losing dad back in the fall, but to think he would knowingly endanger my entire family hit me in a different place entirely, the effect is still felt at this house, and mom and I still suffer from breathing issues and low energy. I’m a dancer, so not being able to breathe well is agonizing for me in the studio. 
I genuinely don’t think I’ll ever forgive him for this, he still doesn’t wear a mask at work, or make anyone else wear one either, us getting sick AGAIN is honestly likely. My parents try to control my finances as much as possible, and I can’t get a job currently, so I can’t move out to avoid the mental and physical harm of living with people so divorced from reality. It uh..sucks pretty bad, sorry for such a long and incoherent vent, I’ve been lurking here for a while n made an account to get it off my chest.

937,Possible strategy for dealing with believers: place bets with them,"Listen to what they're saying. When they predict something specific that's obviously batshit (""Trump will institute martial law right before Joe Biden is inaugurated"") place a bet with them. Make it as large as is responsible based on your and their income. $50 is probably a good starting place. This brings salience to the correctness of their beliefs - when they believe conspiracies that they can't really act on other than constantly consuming media, there's never any tests to their beliefs. Add one. Make it hurt to fail. Make them fail a ""are my beliefs true"" test repeatedly. 

Be specific, trying to minimize wiggle room. ""I bet you $200 that Joe Biden's inaugaration will be shown, or at least discussed as a true fact on CNN, Fox, Breitbart, and &lt;the local paper&gt; on January 20th, and that these sources will say he is still in power one week later"" is a better bet than ""I bet he'll be inaugurated on the 20th.""

I'm hoping this might help those of you who are trying to reach  your Qperson.

941,why can't i hate her,"My mother has always been difficult and conservative. She's a high-level narcissist. She listened religiously to Dr. Laura and consumed a lot of Fox News. When I came out as trans to her she apologized to me for all the hateful things she said about other trans people by saying she was still learning... later on, I found out that my Aunt--one of her sisters--has been trans this whole time (my mom's family is from the Philippines, where trans people are more common and accepted), revealing that whole ""just learning"" thing to be a lie. Earlier during the pandemic, she kicked my sister out of the house after a fight about washing dishes. When I asked my mom how she could vote for Trump despite my own experiences with sexual assault, she replied with ""You never told me that,"" as if to gaslight me into thinking I never confided with her about the biggest trauma of my entire life, which I \*did\*.

I wish I could hate her and yet I still love her and worry constantly about her. Even just last May, when the pandemic was still in the beginning stages, my mom was very careful about wearing masks, washing hands, taking everything seriously. That all changed in summer, when she found some sort of far-right podcast. In just a matter of months she went from a regular Fox News watcher to a Breitbart commenter, and then later a Q espouser. I keep trying to tell myself not to feel sorry for her, because this was always how she was deep down, yet I can't really commit to that. Even with how conservative she was in the past, she still seemed to ""love"" me, even in her own toxic, weird way. Now not even that is left, and I've been blindsided by how fast the change has been. In less than a year from when she first started listening to those podcasts, she began to beg our entire family not to take the vaccine, that Bill Gates and China orchestrated the pandemic, that Gavin Newsom is a plant sent from China, that the face masks are the same as armbands in Nazi Germany.. She'd stockpile food telling us that martial law would be declared soon. When doing the laundry, dad would find that she stitched the words ""MAGA"" and ""TRUMP"" into her clothing. She even bought a gun, despite having never been interested in firearms before, and started to install some kind of anti-riot bar on the front door... even though she and my dad live in a gated community. She isolated every one of her brothers and sisters. Even one of my other aunts, a vocal trump supporter, has said she had to stop talking with our mom because ""she's lost it"". Mom has even ended her closest friendships because they don't believe her conspiracy theories. My dad will soon be leaving her, he's just fed up with her sending him conspiracy images and texts day in and day out. 

She was always deep down like this, yes. And yet, she's also a completely different person. Any semblance of love she was holding onto is gone now. And I want so desperately to say good riddance and never think about her again, yet I can't. Every day I worry and mourn and grieve for her and who she used to be. Even with how shitty she's been in the past, I feel like I've lost someone. Even with how bad she's been, she's somehow gotten \*worse\*, which I thought impossible. 

It's been hard to confide in my friends because none of them know what this is like or what I'm going through. All of my lefty friends like to make jokes about Qanon and Trump supporters and how stupid and crazy they all are, and I can't blame them because it does feel that way from the outset. But I can't bring myself to laugh with them, and if anything it makes me uncomfortable. That ppl can derive some kind of schadenfreude in something that has managed to dissolve my entire family from the inside out, that's turned every conversation in the house into a tense minefield, that worsened all our lives as my mom refuses to wear masks and brings germs to my dad and drives both of my sisters out of the house. She's completely alone now, and even if that's what she deserves, it still sucks to watch her spiral further and further.

On January 5th, I found out that my mom was not going to Stockton to visit family, but instead flying to Washington D.C. to take part in the protests. The day after, the insurrection happened. And while none of us know for sure whether or not she was with those people who broke into the Capitol building, what we do know is that, either way, she's not just toxic anymore, she's flat-out dangerous. Something activated her. Something told her to go to D.C. on January 6th, a day that these Q-ers have been actively planning. What's left is not the woman who raised me but some kind of soldier for a holy war that doesn't actually exist.

I want my goddamn mother back, warts and all. I hate that that's something I have to say, and I hate that even my closest friends can hardly fathom how to comfort me. I always stuck my nose up w/r/t reddit but I've just felt so alone and reading that huffpo article that came out today only made me feel more depressed.

My brother, with whom I've had a very close relationship, began steering the conversation in a direction that supported the theory of race based intelligence. I was horrified. I have daughters and grandchildren of color AND our own family has SE Asian heritage. So for my brother to be buying into this garbage was shocking to say the least. I mourned after that. Since, I have observed his descent into Trumpisms and far right wing conspiracies. He has been involved in a fundamentalist church for many years, and I am fully aware of the insular viewpoints of said religion. I was once a fundie as well. Since that conversation our relationship has been strained. Though we have had a long discussion about proceeding forward in the name of peace and family love and to just avoid 'those' topics, it still does NOT sit well with me. I know that he has voted on behalf  of his kids - all disabled adults - for the far right candidates during this past election. I know that he proselytizes in public - anti mask, covid denier, etc. with his kids (they posted on FB). So, yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents, while republican and evangelical, have been negative on Trump and QAnon. They've expressed that those in their social circles who are Trumpers, Qultists, and antimaskers are kooks, but..... I still worry they're still at risk for being radicalized. They still easily associate with these people who spout political bullshit, they don't pay attention to news journalism because ""it's all for ratings"", while they believe covid exists they're lax about masks and distancing, their casual racial biases means they're not exactly positive on progressive movements like BLM, and both of them spend a lot of time on the internet-- my mother on FB and my dad on YT. Both of them are stressed because of the pandemic and my dad's layoff. If they stumble across the wrong branch of Q conspiracies, they're primed for it. I dunno, one of the ones with Antifa plants or pedo rings.

I expect my influence on them is limited, as not only are they aware my political beliefs are different from theirs, I'm their child-- and my mother still treats me like \*a\* child most of the time.

956,Not quite Q'ed Mom but she's on her way - don't know what to do,"After complaining about my mother's antics for a while my friend recommended this subreddit to me.
I don't know if my mother has been Completely taken over by Q but I think she's well on her way there.
This is mostly just to air out my dirty laundry, though if anyone has advice that would be greatly appreciated. :)

My mother is a well-meaning and kind person, and I love her to death. Unfortunately, she's fairly deep in right-wing conspiracy theory and I'm afraid sooner or later she'll start believing actual QAnon conspiracy. I know exactly how this descent happened - she's a very devout Christian, watching sermons on Youtube and such. When I had complained to her about Trump back in 2016/2017 she initially agreed with me and said that he truly did sound like a horrid man, and so she looked him up on Youtube to watch anything informative. I believe her Youtube algorithm sent her more right-wing leaning videos bc of her search history (what is it with American Christians and being right wing? lol). And it only got worse from there.
She doesn't believe in ridiculous statements like 5G causes cancer or anything and is not an anti masker/covid denier, but she's wholly convinced that the 2020 elections were rigged in Biden's favor, that ANTIFA were responsible for the Jan. 6th Capitol terrorist attack, and that the COVID vaccine is dangerous and won't get it until basically everyone else does and is aware of any long term side effects. It's caused deeper strains in my parent's relationship to the point where my father sometimes vents to me about her.
By no means do I blame my family's religion by the way - I am a practicing Christian myself. What hurts the most for me is the way the algorithms and other right wing figureheads manipulated her into believing all of this, despite the fact that my sister, my father, and I have disproven her statements multiple times.
I'm 21 years old and still live with my family due to the pandemic - otherwise, I would be on campus at my college. Cutting my mother off entirely is a rather unrealistic option for me due to having four younger siblings (I'm the eldest child). While the rest of my sisters are aware of how ridiculous my mom sounds sometimes my brother soaks up everything she says, and that's what concerns me the most. Cutting her off from my life would give me guilt about being unable to watch over my brother along with fears of losing my first language (I speak to my father and one of my sisters almost entirely in English, along with my friends and partner.)
I'm wondering if I should sneak her phone away from her for a bit and completely wipe all of her Youtube search/view history and subscriptions and replace them with, well, Not conspiracy theorists. But I don't know, it's something I've entertained in my head for a while now. I apologize for any part of this post being incredibly convoluted and hard to read.",QAnonCasualties

958,To those struggling with family/loved ones trapped by Q-Anon (LONG),"I am writing this not because I claim to be an ""expert"" - (anyone is more than welcome to disagree with me), but coming at it from someone who, along with my wife, was drawn into a bible-based cult many years ago - which led to much family division and heartache. Q-Anon is now doing this with families all over this country, and even around the world. After I started to doubt certain things about the cult and it's teachings, we managed to get out - and started researching cults voraciously, wanting to know how we were so ""gullible"". (We weren't - we were targeted and lied to, but that's another story). It is my hope that what I've learned about cults through researching for many years, along with what I am witnessing now from my own family members, can help others at least understand better what is happening to their loved ones who have been caught by Q-Anon and who have turned against their families in the process.

I have learned much about how yesterday's cults kidnap people's minds. But now, I'm seeing something terrifyingly different. Normally, cults operate from the top down, with one charismatic leader dictating cult rules and behaviors. They can be politically based, or religion-based, etc. But what we see happening with Q is different. It is a melding of two very cult-like mindsets into an online ""super-cult"" that has combined the worst aspects of radical politics with the worst aspects of radicalized religion. It didn't start out being the most powerful brainwashing tool on the planet, but it found a niche and exploited it - and in the process, created something so powerful even the original group that created it could never have foreseen.

It survives and changes based on ""new information"" but always has one main goal - to destroy anyone, any group, or anything that dares question the idol/leader, and to constantly instill fresh fear into it's adherents. The combination of these into a fear-based super spreader cult mentality has created something that is more instant and interactive than television, and that grabs it's followers and turns them, literally, into individuals that are incapable of rational thought. They have been conditioned to believe only Q, or the idol/leader. No information that, even in the slightest way, deviates from the information being supplied by Q will be accepted by the adherents. In fact, many have pledged their devotion to the cause so deeply that they are more than willing to die for the cause. Q encourages adherents to ""do the research"" but in actuality the ""research"" is just articles and videos that support the premise - whatever that might be.

One really unfortunate aspect of Q is that it latches onto the idea of religious fervor, and that its adherents are doing what is “right by God and for God” by believing all of the stuff Q tells them. It mixes religion and politics in a way that is almost impossible for someone on the outside looking in to penetrate. It radicalizes even moderate Christians into zealots who believe that only Q and Trump have the right answers, as Trump has been “ordained, blessed and anointed by God” – probably the most dangerous statement ever made in this century. Their love for God and their faith is hijacked, reversed, and put on steroids. Instead of love being the most important commandment, hate toward those who are not Christian is emphasized and violence/war is presented as “holy” and “for the cause”. Everyone who does not stand for Q or Trump is definitely NOT Christian to the followers of Q. Everyone who doesn’t believe Trump’s continual stream of lies and hate speech is suspect. Everyone who tries to preach a more moderate, loving version of faith is ridiculed and cast aside.

Personally, I've seen the destruction first-hand that cults can do, long before Q. And now, some of my family have been drawn in and they have completely removed any contact with my family over their belief propagated by this super-cult. I see the hate, the rage, all of the things that keep them addicted to the cult. And Q keeps a steady stream of fresh hate and fear going to their adherents. The adherents also contribute and in turn produce more hate and fear and suspicion. It feeds on it's adherents and the adherents feed on themselves as well - and don't hesitate to turn on anyone who is seen to be disloyal to the idol/leader, which right now is still Donald Trump - however the idol can be replaced, and will be replaced when the effectiveness of the current idol is no longer serving the cult well.

**The only effective way for someone to get out of a cult is for them to come to the conclusion on their own that the cult is not what it purports to be.** It is a process of realization - and it can only come from within themselves. Others can point the way, and in the days of ""deprogrammers"" they can point the way very forcefully (sometimes illegally, back in the day). But regardless, it is only the adherent who can extract themselves from it, because it is actually a prison of the mind, and that prison is also designed and forged with thick iron bars and walls of belief to keep them in. They are constantly being told that anyone outside of the cult is ""dangerous"" and ""lost"" and ""ignorant"" and ""the enemy"". The cult will use every lie and apply every kind of psychological pressure in order to maintain control. There is no easy escape. Those trying to help others get out of the cult must exercise patience, empathy and understanding - which is also hard to do when cult members are constantly assailing them, insulting them, threatening them, or otherwise using any and every cult tactic to push them away.

Because of the power of instant information and technology, what used to be limited and more fringe has now become mainstream, including cults - and Q is just the first hugely successful online-based cult that has utilized both old cult tactics and new social media tactics in order to snare its adherents. And because the online relationship is directly into the adherent's mind with no filter and no checks or balances, it is exponentially more potent and powerful than cults of yesterday. It is direct, it is designed to be addictive, and it uses hate, fear and dopamine rushes to completely take over the mind of it's target. **It is very much like a new and super-addictive drug.**

**The only true antidote to a cult is information.** But in this case, the cult IS the only ""true"" source of information - an idea drilled into the minds of those who participate over and over again. The ""fake news"" media, the ""lying politicians"", the ""unwashed masses"" - all are suspect and none are to be trusted. Family members who try to step in and talk sense are immediately shut down, sometimes in a fit of rage from adherents whose ability to accept information contrary to the cult has been completely cut off. They cannot and will not listen to outsiders. They will not accept that they are wrong. And they will not ever be persuaded by angry arguments around facts, because facts are relative to the whims of the cult.

One technique that has been successful in breaking through to some Q-Anon adherents is supplying them with passive information that is sent to them without conversation or confrontation (i.e. via email, for example) - information that lays out in detail why certain beliefs of the cult are wrong or harmful. Preface it by saying that you know they like to research, and you hope they would take a look at some that you’ve found. Letting the adherent believe that they were the one doing the research that led them out of the cult is key, because only they can free themselves from a mind prison they have been led into and have maintained themselves. Nobody can force you where you don't want to go - however if you believe you were the one wanting to go, getting there is ultimately possible.

I hope that those out there who have lost or are losing family members to this dangerous and absolutely insane cult are able to find ways to bring their loved ones back, or at least to understand what really happened to them - for while we are all ultimately responsible for our thoughts and actions, there has been simply nothing on this planet that compares to the power of Q-Anon to snare someone's mind and not let go, causing pain, untold heartache, anger, violence and raw hate to families, institutions, governments, and countries. I believe the third world war has begun, and the battlefield in this war is the battle for our minds. It is not a stretch to believe that, as we have so tearfully witnessed almost half of our country fall into this mind trap called Q-Anon. I have lost family members to Q that, ironically, tried to get us out of our cult many years before! I wish all who are going through this type of situation all the best.

961,Awash in a sea of Q,"Hey y’all, I found this sub in my favorite Facebook group. I’ve been reading through the posts and I finally feel like there are people out there who are sane and rational.

Basically my entire family, immediate and extended, are die-hard Trumpers. I had to block my dad from social media because of his hate-filled, fear-mongering posts. He is OBSESSED with Trump, he genuinely thinks that piece of shit is like, the second coming of Jesus. He’s asked me a few times if I wanted to go to dinner with him to have a “fact-filled conversation”. He came by my house to pick up my daughter for a night, and he spent the entire ten minutes ranting about how Kamala Harris isn’t actually black, Biden is going to cause me to lose my job (I work for Chewy.com, so I’m not sure how that’s gonna happen), and how the entire country is basically going to collapse without Trump. His racism has also been put out there for the world to see.

I’ve never had a great relationship with my dad, so his crap doesn’t surprise me, but what breaks my heart is what happened to my mom. The most empathetic, compassionate, and loving woman I know has turned into a full-blown Trumper and Qer. She really and truly believes that Will Smith and Tom Hanks are cannibalistic pedophiles who sell children to other celebrities to rape and eat. She has become so racist and radical, she refuses to shop at Target anymore because they support BLM, has thrown out all her makeup that are from black-owned companies, etc. She posted something on her business IG a while ago that was something about executing members of the Deep State. That was the first thing that I saw from her about this bullshit. She’s sunk so far into it, it’s actually scary.

Also in my whacko family are my grandfather, who referred to masks as “slave harnesses”, and my great aunt who swore that the QAnon Shaman was a “BLM guy”. When he was identified as the Shaman, it was radio silence from her. She also claimed it was BLM who stormed the Capitol in Trump gear because there were photos of them holding up one fist, the “BLM signal”. Never mind the fact that there are numerous photos of Trump doing the exact same gesture.

964,I've been barred from an entire town.,"First of all, I'm very happy to have found you folks. I feel like a man adrift in an ocean of this insanity. To date I've lost my sister to this nonsense and several close friends. My sister is probably the most disappointing because she's a extremely intelligent individual who has been a teacher for more than a decade. But I digress...

I'm from a town in eastern Ohio that is predominantly  white Trump supporters, we have the occasional liberal or Democrat but for the most part its lower middle income Republicans. The next town over houses 2 bars a small gas station and a 100% Caucasian population. It would probably be a sundown town if they knew what that was. In other words I'm completely surrounded. Being small towns everybody knows everybody, everyone is friend on FB. So at the start of this pandemic when I first heard of Q and everything that it entails, I noticed that it was always being shared by the owners of the bars and their regulars/ friends. So doing my civic duty, I'd point out the flaws in their logic and the facts that could be proven fairly easily. It would end with name calling or them flat out deleting my comments to try and make me look nonsensical. But I never stopped, I wasnt going to let misinformation be peddled unopposed. It continued on like that, small back and forth until Fall. 

Now fall rolls around and election is coming up, the things they're sharing have become increasingly insane and at this point it's the entire town joining this discussion about the storm and the deep state pedophiles(which happened to be any celebrity that spoke out against Trump. Imagine that). And those that havent blocked me are increasingly ignorant. I've been called mentally handicapped and it's been inferred that I shouldn't be allowed around my infant son because I'm a pedophile supporter although not in such friendly terms. But right before the election it goes all out, I have an argument with one of the women who own the bar and her friend. Then next thing I know I have their husbands and their friends(including several with fake names like Underhill from out of state) in my DMs telling me they're going to sexually assault my wife and kill me and my son. My mom's life is threatened, and I'm basically told by several people that if I show up in town that they'll never find my body. My cars windows get broken, tires flattened,  and my house gets paint thrown on it. 

I get cops involved and they basically do nothing which I expected because of the level of political affiliation involved around here. The cops just tell me to avoid that town. A resident I considered a friend of 20 years told me  that I probably shouldn't get gas in that town anymore, to not even drive through it. They blitzed my FB page and reported everything clear back to 2014, so I've basically served consecutive 30 day bans since the end of October. I've got six days left, hopefully I can manage to stay on this time, I think I've deleted and scoured my friend lists to manage to not be banned. I ended up getting my concealed carry and getting a weapon for protection. I'm probably going to end up moving. 

All of this because I wouldn't let their echo chamber go undisturbed. An entire town just swallowed by this shit. I was never ignorant, never name called. I was just persistent to the point where I was the topic of conversation in the bars every night. I've pretty much got them all blocked now so they cant get me banned from FB but my friend tells me they're all still circle the wagons for March 4th. Just riding the wave of insanity. 

TLDR. Got my life wrecked because I wouldn't let an entire towns qanon echo chamber go undisturbed.",QAnonCasualties
965,"Fuck it, Let's have some Qfun on April 1","So I'm not real tech savy, but yesterday I managed to make the Emergency Broadcast Alert \[aka Emergency Action Notification System\] a ring tone on my Iphone12.  YouTube it for instructions on your particular mobile device.

966,Any other Q-casualties interested in a realtime chat/support group on Clubhouse?,"Hey all! Casualty here—I've lost both my parents to this thing, and I strongly suspect a few of my siblings have a foot down the rabbit hole as well. The parents were always into Christian prophecies and alternative medicine, but things took a Q-turn a few years ago before I realized what was going on. By the time I figured out what they'd gotten themselves into, it was far, far too late to stage an intervention. They don't talk to me any more, and I've basically had to grieve them as if they'd died. 

So thank you for sharing your stories. They've really helped me process the loss.

And that leads me to my real question: Is anyone interested in some realtime chat about this on Clubhouse? 

The reason I ask: When I left my faith several years ago, I started a support group for those in my shoes, and...gosh, it's hard to overestimate how healing it was to talk to people who were going through the same hurt and sadness as I was. I love this subreddit for much the same reason, but I also feel the need to talk to folks in real time, to listen to other stories, and—maybe—to collectively brainstorm ways to move beyond this. Coincidentally, I just got a Clubhouse invite, and it seems like an ideal platform to get direct conversation going about this.

Is anyone else interested? 

If so, I'll organize. (I'm new to this, but shoot me your screen names, etc., and we'll figure it out.)

968,I CANT I CANT I CANT!,"Oh, God.  My mom.  I love her and dislike (not hate, it's a strong word) her at the same time.  Why?  I am 13 years old and live in an upper-class neighborhood. I believe she went down the q path back when I was 8.  She took away all electronics, and shut down wifi from 9 pm-8 am, due to *radiation!?!?*  

Then, at age 10, we started hanging out with these new groups of families.  We would all meet up at someplace, and they had cool kids that I would hang out with.  But now, looking back, I realized, that she was shedding old friends.  Lifetime friends since *she* was 8 years old.  These great family friends I had, she got rid of due to the fact that they were doctors and believed that vaccines were safe.  TF?  My mom would yell and scream at them on the phone, about how bad and terrible all these vaccines are, and it's all for depopulation, and control, and money.

Now, here we are in a pandemic.  During the start of it, she started getting heavily into q anon, she then proceeded to shed all friends that didn't think this pandemic was planned!  So from doctors to anti-vaxx moms, to now plandemic friends (that's what she calls it. an f-ing *plan*demic. )  And now trumps our savior, since the beginning of quarantine.  Newsom is a baby eating dude, who wants to shut down the state for control.

You know, yesterday, I had a *huge* fight with her in the car.  About this double masking stuff.  I somewhat agreed with her that it is, just a tad bit extreme having to double layer something.  Then, she said how they (who da f\*\*k is THEY) want to stop normal human function.  And then I said, ""what?""

""Oh ya, they are doing it to shut off human connection""

Then I said, that way too extreme, it's just breathing through a cloth.  and that it's not a big deal to have to talk through it.  and *they* definitely do not create masks with the sole purpose of destroying human connection.  and then I asked why the hell would *they* even do that.

""Control.""

Then we had this huge argument about how *they* are not trying to control us, and that how they're shutting down the world for more control.  On and on and on, until she was screaming at me.  A grown woman, screaming at her 13-year-old son for disagreeing with her.  

Then she proceeded to taunt Me:

 "" Oh, yeah \[my name\] go get your fucking vaccine, and drink and eat poison.  well I am not going to take care of you fat ass (funny enough, I am diagnosed as underweight.  I have to eat, *a lot* in order to feel full. I think it's my metabolism. also I am going through puberty, burning calories), and I won't pay for your medical bills.  you can go to hell""

Yep, my mom said that to me.  We have conversation like these weekly, and I am the devil who wants to join the sheeple, and my mom is trying to save me.

Then, she goes on to say that she wants to have an equally respected opinion like me.  Well no, mom.  you can't yell at me for 15 minutes about how I am wrong, and that you are right.  And no, you don't respect *my* opinion, but I respect yours.  very well. 

Mom, I know you can't read this, you don't even know I have an account.  But if you could magically read this,  I do respect your opinion, it's just that you yell and get aggressive when people don't believe you.  well, you don't believe me.  that's fine, agree to disagree, but no.  that's not enough for me.  I have to believe you, or else you yell at me and others.

And, then worst of all, my little sister, believes all that my mom is saying.  and it's frustrating, but then again, my sister has the right to believe what she wants.

AND, In case you haven't noticed, my mom is a Karen.  she will make a grocery store minimum wage worker, have the hardest hour of their lives, trying to make my mom wear a mask.  that's a whole different story.  I may write it up, but not now.

Thank you everyone for, if you have read my whole post, for reading it.  I had to get this off my chest. It's been driving me nuts. welp, nothing I can do about it.

985,Wholesome Update On Doomsday Dad,"I haven't posted here about my dad before, but I've alluded to him in comments. I don't know if he's exactly Q, but he's been very far-right, fundamentalist, evangelical for as long as I can remember. Doomsday prophecies and satanic panic have been a cornerstone of his rhetoric forever. In 2008 he was quick to jump on the ""Obama is the Antichrist"" train so when Trump came along in 2016 I suppose my dad did see him as a savior.

Since Trump lost the election in November, I've been very worried about my dad. The day the race was called my dad threw a huge tantrum and dramatically destroyed all of his Trump campaign gear, and told me that the end of the world is coming and I should get right with Jesus. My dad would cry apocalypse wolf frequently throughout my youth so this didn't exactly alarm me. What did scare me is that he developed a really nasty streak of COVID denialism that culminated in him saying he would not take the vaccine because it had lead in it and would change his DNA.

My dad is damn difficult but I love him and I don't want him to get sick, or put my chronically ill mom or brother that he lives with at risk. It's been a rough few months, but as a family we've convinced him to bring his concerns about the vaccine to our family doctor instead of using talk radio as his primary source. His position on the vaccine has softened a lot and I think we have a great chance. 

He knows I'm interested in learning a new career and sent me pictures of the CNC machines at his work this morning - the pictures were really terrible and all I could see was his reflection on the doors and that made me laugh.

986,Using QAnon tactics to try to break the spell,"We all know that Christianity is a huge part of how QAnoners real in many of their followers. I’m not here to pushing Christian beliefs nor to deny the validity of them, simply stating my opinion on a tactic that may help when trying to pull loved ones out of the cult. Anytime God or the Bible is brought up to argue a point, I research what the Bible really says about that matter. If I find contradictory verses then I present them. Again this is not about religion itself but the more you can get them to question what they are being told by Q and QAnoners, the hold loosens. Another thing is many of them thrive off of emotional responses. When they know they can’t convince you, they dig for them. If you poke fun at them, they usually either lash out or shut down but either way they’ve stopped listening to you. I know I’ve seen it mentioned before but I’m going to say it again anyway, the best approach is presenting evidence, learning everything you can about a particular subject so much so that the information you give them let’s them know or think that you’re more knowledgeable about the subject than they are and they really haven’t done the research they should have (not condescendingly), ask how certain facts fit into their belief or conspiracy. If they are avid Trump supporters and look to him as the savior of the free world, find ways that he ties into certain conspiracies and contradicts them. Stuff that is reported and known for a fact. He took the credit for low gas prices, then tell them all about the Russia/Saudi Arabia price war. They’re anti-foreign friendliness and collusion, tell them all about him jacking up hotel prices for foreign favor. They think he’s about saving children and stopping human trafficking, tell them all about the Prince of Dubai and what he’s done to his daughters and wife and how he started the Dubai Global Women’s Forum where Ivanka was a guest speaker last year. Tell them about his reported monetary ties to two of the Covid vaccine companies, last reported in 2017. Ask them how Bill Gates can own all patents to all vaccines if the Trump Administration had just funded research for and purchased as many as 6. I once fell for QAnon “red-pilling”. Thank goodness I was only under for about two weeks. Those two weeks though I was honestly losing my mind one day at a time the further I got down the rabbit hole. Someone saw a window of opportunity when I started having doubt in what the media was saying vs what I was seeing with my own eyes via live feeds of the riots. Of course now I know exactly what was going on but at the time, that person fed me enough to send me into a spiral and believing that Trump might really be the ‘gooder’ guy. What sucked me in was a whirlwind of information, lots of little verifiable truths. If I had stopped at the beginning I might still be there. Luckily, I’m an avid researcher. I research objectively from all sides and the further I dug into everything, nothing was really as it seemed. The inconsistencies, the absolutely far-fetched conspiracies like reptilian aliens the cabal JFK Jr, all things I never believed but had to just ignore. As well as the detestable crimes and behaviors of Trump himself that we were told to ignore because he only did those things for the “greater good”.

988,i don't think i love my mom anymore,"i miss her

i've always had kinda a rough relationship w my parents, like borderline emotionally abusive. we used to yell and argue and i would cry multiple times a week because of them. still, i thought nothing would ever stop me from loving them. i thought maybe it was just a teenager thing and once i got into my 20s or moved out things would change. i'm 17 now and i don't know if i'll ever really love my mom again.

when she first got into qanon(around last april-before that she was a democrat for her whole life), i still had hope for her/our relationship, but she's genuinely become such a mean person since then. when we argue she makes fun of my voice, the way the face i'm making looks, the words i use, etc. it's so frustrating because i would never say that shit to her. it's not only completely irrelevant to the conversation but also just rude. i've pointed it out before and even said it was immature and she always responds with something about me needing to ""learn social manners"" and things like that because she doesn't like the face im making. the thing is i've really never been making a face?? like it's always at the most random times and i've never had anyone else(even ppl in my family who would be comfortable w telling me i look angry or something) say stuff like that to me.

since i was around 13 i've had pretty bad depression and anxiety and at the beginning of quarantine it got even worse. but since november i've really been getting better and working on having a more healthy lifestyle. i feel like all my internal struggles are almost gone now, but when i argue with my mom it's so hard not to spiral. i've gotten better at not crying when we argue, but after every argument we have i go in my room and cry for a long time. i know it sounds dumb but the way she is just has such a big effect on me.

even when we used to argue all the time, i didn't feel like this after. i feel empty and like this huge part of my life if never gonna be the same. the mom that goes on qanon rants is not the mother who raised me. she's a completely different person. she used to support blm but now that's a cult, she used to be a democrat but now they're communists, and she used to care about lgbtq+ rights but now it's unnatural. these might just be her ""political"" beliefs but it's changed her completely as a person, even in the sense that she's way more irritable/angry all the time now.

i hate it because sometimes we'll go for days on end with no arguments and life feels somewhat normal again. in a way it's worse because when the inevitable argument comes im slapped back into reality, that this is what my life and my family has come to. to make it even worse she's been convincing my brother and dad to believe in it. they don't really say much about it so i'm not sure where they stand but my dad is a republican so i feel it might be easier for him to be drawn in

i think the worst memory i have of my mom now is the day she told me about qanon, and i did nothing. she came into my room and was all excited because she ""knows i love conspiracy theories""(i did when i was like 14, and i would watch shane dawson youtube conspiracies. not really comparable to qanon.) she told me there was a thing called q and they've been predicting stuff that's happened. i had heard of it maybe once before and knew it was some right wing thing but i had no idea the extent of it. because of that i acted super uninterested and pretty much jut didn't respond. she left and seemed kinda sad almost? bc i wasn't interested. that memory always makes me cry. maybe cause she was like excited about telling me? it breaks my heart to think if i knew more at the time i could've told her and stopped her from ever getting involved.

the things she's said and ways she's acted are just so horrible. i've tried so hard to get over it and act like when i move out it'll be fine because we won't have to talk about it again. but she's in deep and i've tried so hard to get her out, i don't think she'll ever be my mom again. this person she is now is not somebody i love.

We disagreed but still got along splendly. We had a falling out, which was mostly my fault. Right before the pandemic, I texted to apologize, we made up and texted each other sometimes since. Recently, she asked me what I though of Ben Shapiro, and I told her he is a pseudo intellectual hack. She asked why, and I responded that he does not debate in good faith, and he even admits to it in a book he wrote. We got into an argument, where she said he was a brilliant intellectual, she said something like ""he reminds me of you, you're so logical, he has a phrase I think you'd like, facts don't care about your feelings"" I told her I did not consider him an intellectual, and shot back with the BBC interview, and she defended his performance there, saying Neil was the one who went too far. Later I showed her some videos by people I prefer listening to, namely Shaun's video where he responds to Steven Crowder, and a couple others by CCK Philosophy and 3 Arrows. Her response was to dismiss it all as part of the woke crowd. I figure there is no arguing with her. I dont know if she believes in Q specifically but she seems to be going down that road, where hatred of lefties seems to trump (heh) any rational based worldviews. I dont know how anyone can look at Ben saying ""I have more Twitter followers than you"" and think that this is the type of thing a great thinker would say. The video on Crowder was basically calling Steven Crowder out for denying being a racist yet using the same arguments racists use. So if she thinks the video is woke, does that mean that she agrees with Crowder when he says black people are genetically predisposed to being dumber than white people? I dont want to know. 

What hurts is that she knows I'm on the left, when she seems Shapiro demonizing leftists as stupid and emotional, does she not realize that Im the target of his disingenuous mockery? Does she think that little of me that she has a cult like admiration for a guy who spends his career trying to humiliate people like me? That I'd appreciate being introduced to his brilliant mind? 

Yeah, I can't wait until this period of right wing fascism is over. I get nostalgic for the days of 2008 where we all naively thought racism was solved. Fuck Shapiro for doing this to people, fuck Trump, Bannon, whoever the fuck Q is, for trying to stoke the fires of hatred like this.",QAnonCasualties

993,I just wanna say to all who are affected in any way by Qanon...,My heart goes out to you; I am so sorry.,QAnonCasualties
994,Basically have no family left,"I have debated posting here for several weeks now but at this point I just have to vent. Not looking for answers because tbh there aren't any. But I just feel so frustrated and so much despair and have no outlet for it. 

I will preface this by saying myself and my nuclear family have never been close. My parents were horribly abusive when i was young and my only sister is basically a mini-me of my mom. I moved out like a thief in the night 3 days after I turned 18 and never went back. For the last 9 years I have lived out of state and only visited once or twice a year, and when I do I stay with my grandma. My parents and sister have made efforts to varying degrees over the years to reconcile, but I've never received an apology and have struggled with that basically since I left. 

2015 rolls around and I become basically shocked that both my parents are trumpers. My sister is not and my grandma is not. Over the following years my relationship with my parents became even more strained. And now, this year, I find out through my grandma that they are full blown Q. Like, to the point my dad rants and raves to strangers in public about it. My mom and sister ""aren't as bad"" my grandma claims, but any level of trumpism or Q is bad enough. I'm almost grateful to have the excuse of a pandemic to have not visited since Christmas 2019 because I honestly don't even know how I could deal with them. My mom has been texting me more as of recently but I've figured out it is simply her trying to get me to join them in their bullshit beliefs. It is both infuriating and depressing as hell. 

My family is very small. It consists of my nuclear family and my grandma, at this point. I am not married and have no children (without a desire for either if im being honest with myself). When my grandma passes, most likely in the next few years, they will be the literal only family I have in the world. And because of that, I basically will be alone because even if they woke up tomorrow morning and were like, ""oops our bad, that shit was crazy and we were wrong"" I wouldn't even care. Fuck that! The vile and horrible shit they have said and done, combined with the utter stupidity they have displayed by falling for this bullshit, has made me lose any ounce of respect I ever had for them as well as any interest in reconciliation. But at the same time, I'm sad and honestly fucking scared of being without any family in this fucked up world. Like I said im basically just venting. It just all fucking sucks. Fuck trump, fuck Q, and fuck people choosing it over everything and everyone. Ugh.",QAnonCasualties
995,Help the casualties of the Qs. But not the Qs.,"I know there are a lot of people out there who believe we need to help the Qs. I’m not one of them. I’m not interested in understanding them. I’m not interested in reaching out to them. I’m not interested in exerting my energies into bringing them back. Right now, the only thing I’m interested in is holding them to fully account for the damage they have done to our country and the people in it. That’s it. The only thing that interests me more is punishing the lying liars who are freely permitted to spread their lies, even when those lies get people killed, and are actually making money of it all. Yeah, those folks, they’re definitely at the top of the list. I feel bad for all of you that have to deal with Q family members. The pain and loss you must be experiencing is something I hope I never know and you have my sympathies. But for the Qs, I want them to experience the rightful consequences of their willing submersion into this ridiculous cult. Yes, it’s a cult. And like all cults, it is dangerous and it will not end well. These are lessons that must be taught and learned, painfully and through suffering, so that this doesn’t happen again. This may not be the right place to post this but I feel it needs to be said. Because when I read these posts, a part of me really does feel sorry for the people who have lost family and friends over this. But another part of me doesn’t feel anything but rage towards the Q. And my only thought is how badly I want them punished for their eager ignorance. Particularly because they sold themselves for a piece of trash like trump. That fact right there is the one that puts me over the top. They did this all for trump, or because they thought trump would help them. It’s the rotted cherry on a top of a stinking shit sundae.

I do not for sure know if any of them actually stormed the inside but is that even worthy enough of reporting to the FBI? 
She’s pretty far down the rabbit hole. She told my FIL that Democrats need to be killed and she’s made some comments she doesn’t want to live in a world where t isn’t president

1006,"Sister has suddenly started caring a lot about ""togetherness"" and ""birthdays"" ever since last March...","I apologize for coming here to rant. I'm just feeling a lot of things right now. Angry. Frustrated. Tired. I'm showing my sister my better side, but the bad side has to go somewhere. Let's keep this short: I have lived two-and-a-half hours away from my family for like seven or eight years. We never visit for birthdays, except  like a 21st birthday or something, but we all send cards and gifts. We visit for Thanksgiving and Xmas. Sometimes my fiancee and I visit the family for a weekend or so. Nobody visits us.

Last year when covid hit my sister immediately became an anti-masker. I was not aware of this at first. What I WAS aware of was that suddenly my sister started really pushing for everybody to ""go on a trip for her birthday"". This was two months after lockdown started. I said no, definitely not. My brother said no. My mom said yes but cancelled after we both said no. My sister was apparently super crushed and still wanted to have some kind of gathering. I felt bad for her because, at the time, I wasn't suspicious that this was all about covid denial. So I reluctantly agreed to make a day trip to see them, just my family, no outings otherwise, on her birthday. At the time my fiancee was working from home, and I was working but with a very limited number of people (see: two). I also had the ability to take appropriate days off to ensure I wasn't going to spread anything. I was checked for symptoms twice a day at work, and I wore a mask. There were only about 12 cases of recognized covid in town. I felt guilty, but went to her birthday because it was important to her and I was able to take a lot of precautions.

On her birthday I found out she was an antimasker. Because it was her birthday, I did not push the issue.

Then in September, she decides to throw my brother a ""surprise birthday party"". If there's anyone who has a more complicated relationship than her and me, it's her and him. She would never, EVER throw him a party. Also, she like...doesn't throw parties. Our mom does. My sister arranging the party was really weird. I declined. My brother would not have come, but my mom invited him over and...surprise! A bunch of people! To spread germs! Yay!

Thanksgiving came. I declined. My sister decided to travel to Palm Springs with her boyfriend and his family...on a plane...during covid. But before she left she made sure to text me and ask me my plans. I said no, I was not going, my dad is nearly 70 and my sister lives with him and if he died because of me I could never forgive myself. She said, ""Well, you never know, these family occasions are important because he may not make it to next year!"". Then she flew to Palm Springs and spent the holiday without our dad. My mom got pizza and ate it with my dad and my brother. I had store-bought chicken with my fiancee and we managed to have a nice time.

Xmas came. I made my second exception to see them that year. I was nervous, but I missed them so much.

My birthday came and went with well wishes, gifts, and no visitations. My mom got her vaccine and my sister stopped talking to her for two weeks.

Now, today, she tells me she's ""throwing a surprise birthday for mom""! And gee, wouldn't I love to take a day off work and have my fiancee take a day off work and drive two-and-a-half hours during a plague to come celebrate a birthday we have literally never had a party for before? Not to mention my workplace is no longer safe. I am exposed to dozens of people a day. People fucking take their masks off to talk to me all the time and I have to ask them to put it back on....while still in the store. I work with like six people plus the public. My risk factor is much higher. So I tell her no in the most polite way I can. ""I have a wedding coming up this year and I need to save my vacation days for the bridal party and honeymoon"". We will be having the wedding in her city, so I will need time off. This is a valid excuse, especially since I work for a small business, have worked there less than a year, and haven't really been there long enough to justify crippling the staff whenever I want for whatever reason.

Then she says, ""wait what about MY birthday?""

At this point I'm hearing the theme from the Omen playing somewhere in the background. I am damn sure by this point that the parties she's throwing are an excuse to flout social distancing, even if they're in the rules. (I mean, there's going to be like five or six people there.) Then she texts me that ""it just made her so happy to have me there last year and it would mean the world to her if I could come"". So I tell her sure, I'll make an exception for her birthday, but not mom's. My mom will understand. My sister will not. Then she pushes the issue. ""Where I worked you could just ask for days off in advance but I understand"". 

So I tell her as gently as I can, ""I work for a small business and I have been here less than a year. Also my fiancee will have to take time off to get me there. If I lived near you and there was no covid I would visit all of you every birthday"". Then she gets mad saying I should have just told her I was worried about covid. Then she tells me to ""stay safe from the boogeyman"".

I just can't anymore. She keeps asking me to take risks because she ""loves me so much"", but then lashes out when I tell her that I believe in protecting her even if it means I'm being tricked. I have never felt less loved. I have never felt so much like all of our interactions are just manipulation. I told my brother, she used to be just unpleasant, but now I can no longer talk to her without feeling like she's fucking lying or using me for something.

I think I have lost the ability to think of her as poor and misled. She's not respectful. She's not loving. She's malicious. Fuck Q, fuck covispiracy, fuck her.

TLDR: My sister who has never cared about family events (and clearly still doesn't after she skipped Thanksgiving to travel during covid) has been constantly throwing parties for family birthdays and I have to keep declining them. She has never arranged a party for anyone before. She insulted me for telling her no because of covid. I no longer trust her.",QAnonCasualties
1007,Family members attempting reconnection.,So..... now that their trump loving bubble has burst and after four years of listening to their conspiracies and Qanon bs and being told that “we just don’t understand” they now want to pretend nothing has happened. They’ve been so rude to us. Including gloating that we caught covid from “other family members” after doing our very best to isolate for nearly a year.

1008,[Advice Needed] I think my mom has quietly fallen into the Qhole,"Hello, everyone! First time poster, and I’m really new to anything related to QAnon, so please bear with me and correct me as needed.

Background: my mom has always been Republican and conservative, and I used to be until I got out on my own and was able to form my own opinions. She and I have butt heads over politics and policies, but have remained pretty civil, until the coronavirus started making its way to America early-2020.

It started out as little comments here and there, about how it was “just a flu” and how “masks aren’t even that effective” to now she acts like someone is holding a gun to her head every time she has to put a mask on. She also gave me the longest side-eye look when I told her I’d gotten the first round of the vaccine. She’s not totally anti-vax, but she also hasn’t had a flu shot in ten years, so.

This weird “suddenly worsened” trope also went towards her religion. I consider myself more agnostic than anything, but over the last five years she’s just THROWN herself into The Lord. Which, y’know, whatever, but when I was first telling her about my now-ex-partner, her first question was “[are they] a Christian?” Not their name, where they’re from, what they do, no. Their religious beliefs. I gave her a non-answer, and she replied with, “as long as [they’re] not a Muslim” (with THAT pronunciation) and I was just flabbergasted. She also made the off-handed comment this past weekend that “maybe Princess Diana’s death was a ‘God-Thing’, because she was getting involved with that Muslim guy.”

But, honestly, emotional-dumping aside, what I really need advice on is this new bullshit she’s doing. Recently, Biden signed an Executive Order that went over climate change and his plans on helping to fix it/slow it down. Somewhere in that order was something about China. And I’m not being vague on purpose, because which EO and which part of it is where I get tripped up, BUT. To the best that I have been able to figure out, through a right-wing publication, China supposedly now has control of the US’s electric grid. And she is CONVINCED that the Chinese government is gonna give us a national blackout and brick all of our tech. She has this elaborate plan on coming to get me in her husband’s truck (which is older than most, so it doesn’t rely on a computer) and she’s been slowly stocking up on cans and dog food. She didn’t even go this far when we went through both Ike and Harvey.

I guess, my biggest concern is, how do I gently break it to her that she’s gone off the deep end? Or at least dipping her legs into it. I’ve tried before hinting to her that I’m tired of people blindly following articles without doing any proper vetting or research, but she only did so for a week. And please, if someone can figure out which EO she’s talking about, I will be grateful. It breaks my heart to see her like this, truly. I just want my rational mom back.

That's WHY I care so passionately about the right to health care.

That's WHY I think unemployment needs to last longer and lose its stigma.

That's WHY I want people to know that Disability isn't easy to get, but difficult.

That's WHY I think the average wage needs to increase.

That's WHY I resent wealthy people and businesses that evade taxes.

That's WHY I believe the US is in need of a safety net comparable to that in other wealthy nations.

That's WHY I think Americans need to develop empathy for others, realizing that virtually anyone can be financially devastated by events they cannot control.

1012,My 3 y/o niece has nightmares about being cannibalized,"So most of my in-laws are pretty deep into the Qult and conspiracy theories more generally. Right now, the crown jewel of that side of the family is my 3-year-old niece who is an absolutely incredible kid--very bright and personable. During a recent visit, however, I learned that she has nightmares of being eaten by Joe Biden. Notably, she does not know who Joe Biden is, nor can she identify him. But *someone* has obviously been filling her head with this nonsense to the point that it has invaded her dreams and occupies her thoughts almost daily.

1015,The tightrope we walk out of love,"Hello all.  I’m so glad to see this subreddit for support in such a real issue we are facing. I take comfort in the fact that I’m not alone in my struggle, though I’m saddened by how deeply this has impacted our nation that we should need this for solace. I post this not looking for advice, as I believe this is a personal matter and one, as I love him dearly, only I can address. I do hope that by saying things things I might gain mastery over my feelings and maybe even encourage someone else who reads this. 

I grew up in the south, was educated there, and left to gain new perspective.  I never really considered myself a part of any party but I certainly saw myself in the sways of their rhetorics at times. Mostly though, I just never saw enough from the lot to believe this system of government we have to be all that effective (likely a byproduct of capitalism but really not germane to the topic at hand). My father in all of this always taught me to vote for the person not the party and to keep on trying even if you don’t get the result you hopped. When we result to apathy the system no longer represents us. We always had splendid conversations about government and politics and he brought me up to put value in having a set of moral beliefs.  My father was at all times love and never put his needs before mine. 

Ever since my leaving, I’ve noticed a shift in him (and maybe one that has encompassed my long-time once home). A shift that is clearly not isolated and one that has brought me here, reading your testimonies. I, like so many of you, have discussed to the point of losing my temper to no avail and begetting only self defeat. My heart aches and I am tired. 

We have a child now, and this makes my burden all the harder as I want her growing up knowing the man that raised me in love.  I walk a narrow path and should I stray to one side I am lost in the anger and lies of those that find it much easier to escape their freedom by yielding it to those so willing to control them at what ever cost in fascistic splendor. To the other I face the forever separation of the one I hold dear.   I cannot quit my walk down this road though it’s easy to want to throw my hands up and cry out this was his doing not mine. Doing so has its own price to pay. If it were an abusive situation it would be all the easier, but the reality is my father is lost and I’d want my all to see him safely home. I’ve weighed and measured my codependency in the matter. I’ve certainly talked it over times untold with my spouse and cherished friends. What’s left is to walk on in this lonely night and keep hoping for the glimmer of a rising sun. 

In a time now where facts carry no more weight, I can only reason love as my only reaming tool.  

Thank you for letting me get this off my chest, and thank you for this group where we can share. I’m sorry I cannot provide any advice to others as much as I cannot say my choice is the right one for anyone else here.

This man has worked his whole life in the medical field and he’s smart. I always looked up to him. It's 2am, I am so angry and full of despair, and i’ve been crying on and off. I’ve already tried to deal with this with two other friends, but this is on a whole other level.

1023,"I’m scared I’m losing my mom to Qanon, is there anything I can do?","Fortunately, my mom doesn’t listen to Q drops (I think), just listens to YouTube videos to satisfy my Dad who does listen to Q drops, watches Q people on YouTube, etc.

My concern is for my mother who, throughout the quarantine (and for the last four years), has had to constantly deal with her husband telling her conspiracies that keep her up at night and gets mad when she (understandably) doesn’t want to listen to them. He’s been so persistent that he brings her to tears at times, and only stops when I intervene. This has made my life stressful since I’m still in high school and live with them. 

I think she’s just accepted his conspiracies in an effort to survive, since doing anything else causes him to attack her. The problem is that now she doesn’t know what trust, and constantly hears her husband say horrible (unfounded) things about anyone who doesn’t agree with his narrative. I’m really worried she could eventually become just as delusional from sheer exposure and proximity to the conspiracy theories. 

If there’s any advice anyone has for getting through to her, I’d be very grateful. My mom is a logical person and I don’t want her to be lost to the madness that my dad imposes on her. 

TL;DR  my mom is being brainwashed my by dad’s conspiracy and doesn’t know what to trust anymore, so she just believes him. How do I help her keep her sanity for both of our sakes? Is there even anything I can do, or should I just prepare to lose her too? Has anyone had success in getting through to their family?",QAnonCasualties

&gt;For those of you who aren’t familiar with Jeremiah Johnson, he has been very accurate over the years regarding things pertaining to this nation. He had supernatural revelation about the pandemic and this is what he is saying now:   
&gt;  
&gt;Urgent email from Jeremiah Johnson:   
&gt;  
&gt;Today is a special edition of Watchmen Wednesday due to the US Presidential election  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the past year there has been much discussion over Jeremiah’s book Trump and the Future of America.  
&gt;  
&gt;Of particular interest is Chapter 9 where Jeremiah gave an answer to the most frequent question he had been receiving at the time (and all throughout the year leading up to Nov 3rd) ""Will Donald Trump win the 2020 Election?"".  
&gt;  
&gt;His answer in the chapter titled: 'The Winner of the 2020 Election' is currently unfolding right before our very eyes as we watch state polling results trickle in, even as this email is being typed.  
&gt;  
&gt;In this chapter, Jeremiah discusses a dream he had where he saw a vision of President Trump running the Boston Marathon.  
&gt;  
&gt;As he approached the finish line, onlookers began to hiss, shout, and spit on the President as he neared closer and closer to the finish.  
&gt;  
&gt;As he drew within 100 yards… the President fell.  
&gt;  
&gt;Completely exhausted and gasping for air to get up and cross the finish line… two older women emerged from the crowd and somehow squeezed past the bulky security guards.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the two women required a walker just to be able to advance closer to the ailing President—the other a cane.   
&gt;  
&gt;As they drew near to him, a supernatural rush of wind enabled them to lift up the President, and inched him ever so slightly across the finish line.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the dream, Jeremiah was given the revelation that the two older women represented the role of the praying Church who would carry him across the finish line in a last-second victory.   
&gt;  
&gt;These two women (the praying church) also represented an entire generation of people in the US… the baby boomers.   
&gt;  
&gt;We believe that the baby boomers have done their part in this election to make sure to get out and cast their vote, as we saw millions standing in line wrapping around city blocks for the chance to make sure their vote has counted.   
&gt;  
&gt;But now is the time for the supernatural rush of wind that is stirred up by the prayers of the church.   
&gt;  
&gt;Saints we are right smack in the middle of this prophecy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Will you join in, and bombard heaven with your prayers to supernaturally lift up President Trump and help him edge over the finish line?  
&gt;  
&gt;This is what will ultimately determine the outcome of this long and grueling election.  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s an enormous battle raging right now in the spiritual realm. The darkness is trying to prevent itself from being exposed.   
&gt;  
&gt;We’re calling all Saints, intercessors, and prayer warriors to lift up the supernatural wind and help the President who is called for such a time as this, to cross the finish line.   
&gt;  
&gt;Will you intercede for this nation?  
&gt;  
&gt;With Urgency,   
&gt;  
&gt;The JJM Team  
&gt;  
&gt;PS: If you could, please forward this message to a fellow prayer warrior or intercessor to help stand in the gap.",QAnonCasualties
1025,"The Wyoming Republican Party used the conspiracy theory that the Capitol riot was instigated by ""Antifa and BLM radicals"" in their recent letter censuring Rep. Liz Cheney.","I'm sorry if this has already been posted - I didn't see anything - but I wanted to share this because I saw a post on here by someone with a Q relative who was spouting this conspiracy, followed by a lot of comments from others saying they were hearing the same thing from their Q people. I thought we should be aware of how far the reach of these conspiracies has gone. It's being adopted by Republican officials now. 

The statement from within the letter: ""Ample video evidence suggests the riot at the capital was instigated by Antifa and BLM radicals, and FBI sources revealed they have, and have had, evidence the incursion was planned weeks in advance of the January 6th rally and the President's speech."" 

(It's irritating to me how they linked the first half of that sentence with the second half, as if the evidence the FBI has is the same so-called ""evidence"" that proves it was antifa and BLM, when everything I've seen from the FBI proves that most, if not all, the rioters were active Trump supporters.)

In a second Forbes article covering this, it's reported that Liz Cheney appeared on Fox News after the censure to say ""People are being lied to"" about the antifa/BLM connection to the riot.

1028,Feeling Obliged to Perform Damage Control Due To Dad,"Some background: I grew up in a left-wing, very eco-conscious family and general environment (relevant later) - and this would have been in the late 80s/90s, i.e. long before topics like global warming were mainstream concerns. I still consider myself a leftie - though I do have a corporate career at ""Huge Multinational Inc."" that I really love and, as such, work alongside many people who subscribe to entirely different political ideas, including a good few out-and-proud libertarians. I appreciate and genuinely like these people (the odd insufferable co-worker aside). We're friends. This is not about ideology. But what we all have in common is a shared sense of basic human decency and that we're ... well ... not card-carrying racists, misogynists and literal fucking neonazis. Also, for the record: we're not even American, but European.

Enter my dad, stage left. Dad has always been a bit ""special"" - but, relying on my mother's memory here, seeing as I would have been too young to remember - people didn't really notice back when he was just one of the ""young, green, lefty and a tad hippie"" kids. A little bit of ""natural alternatives are preferable in medicine"" would have been par for the course - and a little more ""big corporate has an agenda"" isn't even actually irrational (see above, I work for big corporate as an executive. Confirm: we most certainly do - it just so happens to be a lot more about improving the bottom line than about sacrificing to Satan. Ain't nobody got time for that.).

But then, dad went off the rails at some point and started buying into every conspiracy theory out there and actively propagating it. 9/11 was an inside job? Check! Chemtrails? Check (though he can't seem to quite decide what they're actually meant to do)! Check! The moon-landing was fake? Check! I've genuinely never dared bring up the topic of the flat earth - but I'm willing to bet a month's pay that it'll be a check, too.

Stupid, but it doesn't harm anyone for the most part, so who cares?

But then came ""vaccines cause autism"" and ""my \[obtained via some 8h online seminar\] qualification in spiritual healing enables me to cure cancer"". This is now getting bad and actually has the potential to harm people - albeit, luckily, still only the ones silly enough to believe him.

Enter Trump. And Q. And dad is now completely beyond salvaging. One thing leads to another. Somehow, my father has ended up spouting stuff that somehow, in a way I can't even properly describe because it just doesn't.make.any.fucking.sense.at.all to anyone not equally as brainwashed, unites ""Trump is basically Jesus"", ""Hitler was right"", ""COVID is fake - but also: a get-rich-quick scheme by Bill Gates/the Jews (TM)"", ""facemasks kill"" and ""the vaccine is designed to render us all infertile, except: also mind control, except: also impose a totalitarian regime"" and ""something or other sacrificing humans to Satan"" \[yes, literally - and my own father genuinely seems to believe that I'm, personally, part of this due to where I work\]. And the man has, somehow, assembled a follwowing. And he's spouting his insane shit to thousands of people who will listen.

Needless to say, our personal relationship is probably unsalvageable at this point. I mean, there's genuinely only so many times your parent can accuse you of, literally!, sacrificing humans to Satan before you sort of cut ties for the sake of your own well-being. (And, to be fair: I'd absolutely disown any child of mine if I genuinely believed that was what they were doing - except: luckily for me and my siblings, the batshit doesn't seem to be an inheritable trait).

But I do make sure to report and comment EVERY SINGLE POST dad puts out there. Well, used to ... he's, literally, blocked me at this point. Still read along and make sure to DM every single new person who comments to let them know us kids all think he's an insane, misogynistic racist and can confirm, having grown up with him, that no particularly deep insights are to be obtained from that guy. And, just in case you're still not convinced, would you really trust a guy, 2/3 of whose kids ended up working for THEM?""

I know you don't pick your parents. But it's weighing on me that I, literally, feel responsible for trying to make sure he doesn't succeed in his quest. I know the feelings of guilt are a decided ""me problem"". But, somewhat ironically, I was raised better than this. Including by my pre-insane father, who always used to instill in us kids the need to stand up for what's right and push back.

Do you know any q anons that caught a severe form of covid? How did it impact their beliefs or their relationship with the cult?

1031,Help with Qanon Supporter," 

A friend of mine has a wonderful spouse who is well loved in our group of friends. The spouse is originally from a foreign country and immigrated to marry my Friend. They have a 2 year old kid and up until about 6 months ago everything was normal. Unfortunately it seems that she got sucked into Qanon through her a different group of friends that she has that are all from her birth country. He keeps reaching out to me to vent/asking for advice and at this point I'm old enough to know that...I just don't have the answer.

My friend is not an extreme liberal and doesn't expect strict obedience to a political party...Simply concerned about the path that the spouse is on and where it could take their family. There have been numerous fights about some of the beliefs that are being held including some of the most extreme qanon positions (IE Liberals murder children to make drugs from their bodies...), but the spouse is not ENTIRELY bought in on everything. They still believe the virus is real and do not believe that the Jewish people have space lasers that they use to cause forest fires.

1. Is it naive to assume this will just be a phase that can be ignored?
2. How do you break through the social media control over someone who is essentially in a cult?",QAnonCasualties

1035,My mom has lost touch with reality and I’m at my breaking point.,"My mom is a highly religious pre-Vatican 2 catholic. Prior to Trump taking office, she was already pretty extreme in her beliefs, but we were able to have a relatively civil relationship despite our being on opposite ends of the political spectrum. Her extended family are all Q-Anon devotees, and for the first 3 years of Trump’s presidency she stayed pretty attached to reality, not buying into their beliefs. However, over the past 8 months or so she’s become increasingly wrapped up in their conspiracy theories, and now believes that the Epoch Times is the only reliable news source, pedophiles are everywhere, Trump won the election, and that we are approaching the End Times. We can’t have a conversation without it devolving to a place that I can only describe as being entirely detached from reality. She thinks Antifa is responsible for the events of January 6th, and that communists are coming to take her property. She and her family are convinced that my attending a public university resulted in me being brainwashed into believe the false narratives told by mainstream media. Despite her being a nurse she doesn’t believe that Covid is any worse than the flu and that the precautions I take are over the top. Her family has taken to trying to pick fights with my older brother despite constant efforts to disengage. 

Yesterday I spoke with her for ~20 minutes, trying to ask her to get her family to back off as my brother and I aren’t looking to start any further conflict, but somehow it became her telling me about how Satan is among us and that she can’t believe I haven’t realized that the Q-Anon theories of our government being steeped in pedophilia and communists trying to take over are true. She kept saying “you’re smart, how do you not see?” She told me that Critical Race Theory is evil and the BLM protestors are looking to start a race war. When I tried to ask her to stop talking about it all she started screaming at me. I hung up. 10 minutes later she called me back to try and talk about it again. 

My dad runs the Mayo Clinic covid lab testing program, and yet he does nothing to stop her from buying into the insane theories she and her sister are constantly talking about. My older brother and I are honestly at a loss as to what to do. She has been emotionally abusive our entire lives, and now obviously has entered another territory entirely. I’m considering family therapy, but am doubtful it will be successful. My therapist is too. 

I know many here have struggled with a similar situation. Where does a person draw the line? I know that my mom is only bringing me stress and I don’t know if she will return to a sane place without some form of treatment, and I think cutting her out of my life entirely might be the best decision for my own mental health. But she’s my mom, and even if I don’t love her, I do care about her, and I’m scared of what will happen if there’s no one to push back on her crazy theories. I also am not ready to lose my relationship with my dad. When is enough enough? Have I already reached that point? I’m at a loss, and it’s honestly one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to deal with.

Everytime I talk to her she turns the conversation towards how she’s convinced that Biden stole the election, Trump is trying to save America, democrats murder babies, etc. My mom will send me videos like “Absolute Proof” and “Unmasked” about the election and I have been trying to softly tell her that the videos are pure bull and provide citations and sources that back my claims but she just refuses and digs in deeper. 

I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this, she makes me want to scream when she flat out rejects my evidence as “fake news” or tries to tell me that all of the lawsuits were thrown out because Biden was controlling the lawyers.

Qparent is deep in- emails to us at all hours from Simon Parkes and Lin Woods. No friends, lost their job, 5G/vaccines/Michelle Obama transvestite stuff- all of it, all the time.  I don't know what else they do besides look at Q material online. 

I am so shaken and terrified of Qparent. I cannot understand anything about them anymore. My sister thinks I am overreacting. She thinks our parent can make their own choices how to spend their time during the day, and wishes she would ditch Q for the real world, but doesn't think harm will come of it. My parent has never shown any sign of violence, and is more of the Q follower who hides at home reading their Bible praying for the EBS alert than the ones which storm the capital. Still, I am terrified of the reality my parent has built for themselves. What is someone capable of doing if they are reading this 24/7? 

I haven't been around them since the pandemic began because we live on opposite sides of the country, my work schedule, etc. They have no interest in interacting with me except through my daughter. We call a few afternoons a week so they can talk and my daughter can show her toys and stuff. 

But we may have an opportunity to see them during my daughter's spring break and I am terrified. Qparent will not be getting vaccinated. I want my daughter to have a relationship with her grandparent, but I feel like I can't leave them alone. My parent adores my daughter and has never done anything to physically harm anyone. I can't get the idea in my head that they would do something crazy in anticipation of the coming ""10 days of storm""/rapture of the true believers/execution and military tribunals. If you truly believe that stuff, aren't you primed to act like this is the end?  

Am I overreacting? Talking to my sister makes me feel like I'm a raging liberal who has low tolerance for people on the other side of the spectrum, and that if all of us are vaccinated except our Qparent then that's their choice.

Before you read this, I highly encourage everyone here to Google how to deprogram a cult member. You will see compassion is key to their rescue, not challenge. This was written in response to someone blasting Facebook for enabling Qanon and essentially blaming FB for it: 

Yes FB is wrong for enabling- allowing these groups to flourish after realizing the extent of the problem. However, the ‘Know nothings’ (real name) flourished and spread into government at a time long before the internet was a speck of a dot of a tiny twinkle in Al Gore’s eye.  And how did they do that? 
You can’t blame Facebook. Yes, they have shame to wear, but this isn’t their ‘fault’
The thing about Q, the way these algorithms work, and how ppl who until then we’re stable &amp; rational human beings, don’t realize, and what they and all of us should do more than anything is to take a long AND HUMBLE look at how typically rational, stable human beings react to:
-Being in love at a young age
-Being in a destructive, abusive (etc) relationship and in denial of it [think: ‘you’re wrong! They would never do that’]
-Being in denial of ANY addiction (or obsession) &amp; the harm it causes the self and others
-Mob Violence
-Religious Fervor
And even prejudice, or racist beliefs[the way we refuse to let go of our biases, even once made aware of them]

It’s ALL the same mechanism in the brain and ALL of us are vulnerable. Denial of that very basic fact, making fun of people who have fallen for it or laughing at them, only makes you MORE vulnerable and illustrates exactly why it’s SO EASY to fall into being fooled- it’s because we fool ourselves. We are good at it too because it’s supported by what we all see as basic fact for ourselves:  the belief that you/we have control over yourself/ourselves &amp; our emotions, &amp; beliefs. It’s the vain belief that your bs monitor would have stopped you, that of course YOU can tell the difference where another couldn’t. Aren’t you special? You’re not. 

That is the exact same belief each and every QAnoner has right now, it’s why they are so certain they are right. Because of course, how could they not be?

Understanding that this is more basic than the desire to be a hero, to do something important, to make sense of the world or believe we are loved and the world is in fact how we see &amp; perceive it. It is the refusal to accept we could be wrong, and the fear that we may be. 

That surety, that lack of humility is in action in every example above- including Mob justice. Afterwards, just like many ex-cultists, those people (mob) react with horror at their own actions. How could they have been so wrong?
Because they CAN. Because YOU can. Because I can. Knowing this, accepting this, and believing THIS will not only help others react compassionately and spare us all from looking for a villain to blame rather than look inward- it will also save us you from becoming a participatory villain yourself. Recognize it COULD happen to you, and may even have already happened in one of the examples I shared. Questions should begin with the self:
why do I think this, why am I doing that what does the evidence actually say and does it stand up to scrutiny? Am I avoiding the evidence that contradicts my beliefs? Am I in denial of it?

Or most importantly and much more simply, ‘could I be wrong?’",QAnonCasualties

When my mom kicked me out at 18 for having a boyfriend, she told my entire family that I ran off with my boyfriend and they believed her (minus one sibling who witnessed her threatening me for months). Believing I was choosing to move in with a guy I had been dating for 5 months, he still supported me, helped me move, and sent me off with love and kind words while my mother still refused to speak to or look at me. He was distraught when he learned the truth later on, but it still showed me that unconditional love does exist and that he was still the kind teddy bear of a man that he was when I was a child. 

Cut to more recently - he seemed to try and sympathize with the events at the capitol, especially with the woman who was shot and killed while climbing over a barricade. After the election he seemed to post more about election fraud and in general shared content that attacked the popular Democratic party party members. His social media posts have been disparaging to anyone on the left, women, trans people, and even healthcare workers thanks to some recent anti mask sentiments (ironically his wife/my mom works with covid patients, has recovered from covid, and has lost family to it). 

When I was younger I wouldn't have believed you if you would have told me that my dad would idolize someone like he does Trump. He was always so kind of and accepting (once a traditional Catholic who lovingly accepted my siblings when they came out as gay), and I am having a hard time accepting that this isn't the case. 

Sorry for the rant, but I couldn't think of where else to post this. He has always been conservative, but something about the past several months has amped up the hatred and bigotry.  I feel like I am mourning my father.",QAnonCasualties
1052,"Lost My Uncle to Q, and I’m Worried About How It’s Influenced My Parent","I know this isn’t exactly what this sub is for, but I’m at a loss. My uncle was a loving and amazing man, whom I have adored and had a close relationship for most of my life. A few years ago he started to show signs of becoming radicalized but every time he talked to me I was able to redirect and challenge what he said in a way that was not confrontational. I didn’t know, but at the same time he was sending both of my parents the creepy and disturbing Facebook videos and telling them to “do their research”. My parents didn’t know about Q, but they told him to stop and recently blocked him on social media because he wouldn’t stop sending unsolicited conspiracy videos. 

What I didn’t realize is that my mom (who is mentally ill and a Facebook addict) is spending a lot of time engaging in arguments with Q people, without knowing what Q is. She’s now watching the news constantly and compulsively trying to prove them wrong. I really think this has to do with the fact that her cousin went full Q (like visit from homeland security for accidentally sending money to bad people) and my uncle (dad’s brother) and she can’t cope with the fact that she couldn’t change their minds. It’s destroying her. 

My uncle doesn’t send me any inappropriate videos and doesn’t try to talk to me about any of it, and I am really confused on if I’m somehow enabling him by speaking to him. He’s so lonely and clearly depressed that I don’t want to avoid him if he isn’t bringing it up to me, which I consider a tiny good sign. 

Does anyone have any advice for how I can support my mom, because her obsessive behavior isn’t that far off from his and she is clearly struggling with putting her foot down. She’s very religious so I think that also is playing a part in her guilt for “giving up on him”. I can’t even have a phone call with her without her bringing up the online arguments that she’s getting into with online Q people, and it seems really unhealthy. 

Also any input on the idea that speaking to my uncle about non-conspiracy topics is implicitly supporting the Q stuff would be helpful as well.",QAnonCasualties

1054,How should I pull the plug for my mom before it's too late?,"So my mom is a simple person. Empathetic and kind but was always an apolitical person. I convinced her to vote Democrat pretty easily for the 2018/2020 elections just on the basis of Republicans never prioritizing the environment and constant reminders of the shit Trump's pulled.

But she's always been *kind* of an anti-vaxxer (doesn't believe in the whole autism thing but didn't let us get flu shots while we were minors) and said herself she doesn't really know how to tell ""the right information from the wrong"". And ever since the pandemic's started, she's been video chatting with her old high school friends who are staunch Republicans. I looked through some of their texts while helping her optimize her phone and it was filled with Democrats being called ""the Socialists"" and complaints about BLM. She said she generally tries to keep her friends from going on about politics too much but it seems like she's ""outnumbered"" as the only apolitical/Democrat-leaning one out of the 5 who discuss conspiracy theories and how they're related to God as casual chitchat.

Last year she almost fell for the Pandemic video that made rounds and went off the rails trying to convince me that hydroxychloroquine was the miracle cure to COVID. She tried to claim that all of this wasn't tied to the Republicans. I got so worked up finding counter evidence and she slowly dropped it only to bring it back up today (yes, at *this* point of the fucking pandemic). And surprise surprise, she had a group call with her friends earlier today. She also started bringing up the Democrats being involved in pedo rings (pizzagate??) and I realized that this stuff is quickly veering into Qanon territory, isn't it?

I really feel like I've reached this point where if I don't do something now, she'll eventually fall into the Qanon hole too, especially when I move out and I'm not there to constantly refute her points and recruit my very passive (but highly intellectual/logical and immune to bullshit like this) dad to help me.

Should I tell her to stop talking to her friends? I can tell her to stop watching the weird right-wing religious sermons and conspiracy videos her friends send her but I just know that she'll eventually restart watching them (thinking they're ""harmless"") once I move out. It's already exhausting having to constantly pull my mom away from the party that wants to deny me basic hunan rights as a (closeted) lesbian woman and being the only one in my family who's actually concerned about these conspiracies potentially consuming her life. It sounds dramatic but I fear this is a potential turning point for the worse.

Life was much, much simpler when all she watched and talked about with her friends were trashy Korean dramas and Netflix soap operas.",QAnonCasualties
1055,Losing a friend to QAnon,"I felt like I lost a friend a little over a week ago. Not a particularly close friend; just a long-time friend that I had known since before we were teenagers. (We’re in our 20’s now.) I know that many others on this forum are facing far more personal losses, and I don’t seek to minimize that; but in a sense, it became more real to me how tragic it is.

My friend has been posting a lot of Q themed stuff on Instagram. Doesn’t believe covid is severe, resents wearing masks, and in more recent times it’s gone to some more wild theories as well. I first found out about QAnon when I googled for information about one of their posts; I was a little shocked that my friend would actually believe such a thing (the particular post was related to pizzagate). I asked them if they had any sources, and they had some blog article they read years ago but they didn’t have the link saved.

My friend re-posted a rant about free speech on their Instagram story. It was about how censorship is bad primarily because it creates echo chambers, and that it’s healthy to engage with other people’s ideas even if they aren’t in agreement with yours.

I looked at the source, and it was clearly a pro-Q account. But most of the rant itself I *technically* agreed with; I too am in favor of speech not being censored by the government, and I certainly enjoy engaging with people of varying ideas even if I don’t see eye to eye with them. I thought it would be a good opportunity to engage my friend in some discussion on something where we actually might be able to come to a partial agreement. So I replied to the IG story; I felt that I was respectful, saying I agreed with a lot of it but I thought there were some more nuances to it that I wanted to comment on. 

My friend (on their non-private account where their stories are not view-restricted at all) replied, “You don’t know me well enough to engage with my political posts, thank you.”

I don’t doubt that I would have gotten a different response had my friend not suspected I was subtly challenging their view.  I told them I’d respect their decision if they didn’t want to talk about politics, but that I was a little hurt that they had said that to me. They promptly blocked me from seeing any more IG stories, but haven’t unfollowed or blocked me completely yet.

It’s a shame. We weren’t even very close; but I considered them a lifetime friend I could have counted on. It hurts, not as much that they believe something I think is nonsensical, but that they would rather hurt an old friend than face someone respectfully disagreeing with them. (After all, they could have just ignored me, or they could have said “hey, thank you for your comment! I don’t really have the energy right now to discuss it, though.” But instead they said something hurtful.)

The fact of this happening over a post talking about the importance of interacting with people who hold contrary ideas is a level of irony that would be comical if it wasn’t so sad...",QAnonCasualties
1056,How to get over the hurt?,"Before reading anything about Qs relationship to cults I was doing a bit of tough love with my husband which has resulted in my being named as the scapegoat for our failing family. I’m the one making things difficult and I should just avoid talking about politics but that is really all he talks about. He’s even told me he wants a divorce and I just think to myself that my daughters and I are the ones being hurt but he is really truly blaming me saying that I’m destroying the family by nagging him about this. I don’t know how we move past this. His daughters have lost respect for him because they can’t believe he believes the things that he does but he says I’m turning them against him and poisoning their minds! I’m willing to do almost anything to save my family and marriage which includes family therapy and using the hands off tools for dealing with people wrapped up in a cult, but I just hate feeling like I have to accept blame or keep putting up with this until he sees the light. 24 years of marriage and I’m so afraid it might be over.",QAnonCasualties

1059,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

1071,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did “hours of research”. I also didn’t know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn’t vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly. It makes me sad that he’s fallen into this and was trying to “red pill” me before I even knew anything about politics.",QAnonCasualties

1076,Brother married QAnon girl he met on internet and cut off the whole family,32 y/o former college and pro hockey player who had a mental break in college.  He has a history of mental illness and mania and has been hospitalized many times. Each time he was manic it’s like the conspires got more intense. He has always been into conspires but this time is different. He married a “spiritual Teacher” he met on the internet. She moved to the US from Canada to marry him. They are both deep in QAnon but call themselves gatekeepers of the planet. As soon as trump lost he stopped talked to us (his family and friends). I really don’t think we will ever get him back. The girl he married seems to have a big following online and teaches courses. It’s all links to QAnon even tho doesn’t explicitly say it. I’m scared. I’m sad. I’m grieving but I’m angry.

1077,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who’s having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time—usually because I don’t play their game very well— but that’s the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don’t know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I’ve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven’t seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he’s just so heavy-hearted. It’s honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he’s very reasonable, really seeks to understand other’s perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don’t know what? We’ll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we’re pretty limited. But I’d just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I’d find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

1078,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

1079,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

1081,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn’t what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it’s become obvious how she’s gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn’t plan on getting the covid vaccine because it’s “made of aborted baby cells” and “99% percent of people aren’t affected by covid anyway”. My grandma’s room is right across from my room, so this isn’t the first time I’ve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just “letting lies into our house”. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma’s case). We’ve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he’s generally healthy. I’m convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor’s appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn’t get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she’d listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she’s started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that’s sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it’s a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom’s belief system is that as he grows up, she’s gonna pass this on to him, too. I’m scared of him developing internalized racism because she’s so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors’ perspective on George Floyd’s death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I’m even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I’m sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind’s just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive? I’ve tried many times to reason with her, but I can’t anymore. I had a feeling this was coming, but I never imagined feeling *this* hopeless.",QAnonCasualties
1082,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She’s written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as “mumma bear”. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We’re British (she’s American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she’s organised meet-ups when she’s visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it “the looking glass technology”)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they’re all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What’s worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt “liberated”, another saying “trump is god” (she ‘likes’ all of these comments). I’ll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she’s just feeding into all of this. I’ve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there’s nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

1083,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

1084,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said “OK.  I don’t trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I’ll also reach out to (biologist friend)”

I’m honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won’t let me see) she’s suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn’t want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned.

1092,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

That these are good, intelligent people who want the best for their patients. And I told her about the countless 911s calls I’ve taken from people with severe c19 symptoms. A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn’t deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about “the Zionists”), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: “You are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can’t and won’t. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government. 
Are you aware of HCQ? Or ivermectin?
You even trust Gates🙇‍♀️”

1095,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

***Conditions -*** ***Festinger stated that five conditions must be present if someone is to become a  more fervent believer after a failure or disconfirmation:***

* A belief must be held with deep conviction and it must have some relevance to action, that is, to what the believer does or how he or she behaves.
* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified. If, however, the believer is a member of a group of convinced persons who can support one another, the belief may be maintained and the believers may attempt to proselytize or persuade nonmembers that the belief is correct.

1097,"""When Prophesy Fails"" - Why Members Stay Even After the Goalposts are Moved","There is a book that covers a very well-known and foundational psychological study on why some members of a group leave - while others double-down - when a date prophesized comes and goes.

This is the work that coined the term ""cognitive dissonance.""

The book, written in 1956, is a principle reference on in-group and/or cult dynamics.

1098,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

1099,"My mom suddenly believes Trump is still President, that 9/11 was fake, 5G is killing us all, Michelle Obama is a trans woman, and that the Holocaust was fake. It's really starting to annoy me. Is this what Qanon is about? What do I do?","My mom was formerly liberal leaning.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

Edit - now she's saying she's going to spend all her money on gold because once it's revealed that Trump is still president, we will not have cash anymore. I politely had to explain to her to not spend all her money in case that doesn't happen.",QAnonCasualties
1100,my mother had a breakdown in the car with me and told me that i treat her like shit.,"I just got home after the car ride with her, and i’m sitting in my room typing this. I don’t even know what to feel.


Last night, my mom sent me a youtube video titled Tony Robbins redpills the world on covid fraud, with a message saying to please listen. Obviously, i didn’t listen, not because it’s about redpilling the world, but because i don’t like politics and i have told her this multiple times before. 


Today after school my mom took me to get a haircut, i got it cut, told both my mom and hairdresser thanks, then me and my mom went to the store. We got the essentials, yk, and some snacks. I carried it all out the car for her. I even gave her some of the snacks we wanted and shared. Then halfway on the way home she asks if i watched the video she sent last night. I say no. she then says “is it because i sent it?” I tell her no again, and that i’m sorry but i don’t enjoy political content and stuff like that. she goes quiet for a little bit then tells me “you treat me like shit.” my mom never curses. I told her that i didn’t and that i love her. she then repeats it, and then says “you treat me like so much goddamn shit.” I go quiet and she stops the car. She tells me to get out and walk home. I’ve had enough at this point and just say “okay” then leave the car, but before i start walking she tells me to get back in. I get back in then we drive home. she’s quiet the whole time. 


What the fuck? what do i even do? I can’t tell if i’m actually being an asshole or not. I always thought i wasn’t the best son, but i never thought i treated my mom like actual shit. Someone please help.",QAnonCasualties
1101,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

1103,Finally happened to me,"I’ve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I’m currently in college writing my thesis on it. I’ve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I’ve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it’s finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close—she’s a conservative Catholic and I’m a leftist atheist, but we’re friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They’ve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I’m so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn’t, because I didn’t know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she’s refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it’s personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I’ve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties

I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

1105,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

1107,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people’s lives (for the follower and the follower’s loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you’d like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you’d like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

1110,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile– she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties

1112,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

1113,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money.

1115,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

1119,Why are conspiracy theories so popular in the US?,[removed],QAnonCasualties
1120,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don’t know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom’s deterioration, I never once considered that I’m not the only child or loved one going through this. I’ve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother’s ... Q journey. 

I’ve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom’s aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I’m hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I’ll just explode. But, she’s my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I’m angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she’s become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don’t at all, and I’m ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don’t know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, “you’ll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you’ll see on [insert date]” etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don’t want to just switch my heart off towards her but that’s the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you’ve reconciled any of this in yourself, I’d love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I’m so grateful to this community.

1121,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: “I have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don’t spend as much time doing things you love, you don’t hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don’t feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can’t live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you’re super smart but I don’t feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don’t hear it or see it and he doesn’t discuss it with me unless I say it’s ok.

If I say it’s ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one “fact” at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie’s framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I’ve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I’ve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he’s even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say “remember we agreed to”, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

1125,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama  hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.  Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases. Social media has been the downfall of our society now, where people hate so easily and are persuaded to believe in many absurd conspiracies without hesitation.

1126,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he’s deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He’s been diagnosed bipolar but doesn’t seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn’t know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I’ve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don’t they work in the gambling space where he’s lost great amounts), I’ve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won’t engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn’t check on unless he’s in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he’s scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I’m rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don’t care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don’t see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can’t focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

1130,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

1138,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

1141,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I’ve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it’s helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I’ve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I’ve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I’m sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she’s spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She’s anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn’t follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note – the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister’s baby’s day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn’t be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that “I might just have to go get vaccinated then if that’s what it’s gonna take to see you. I miss you.” Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I’m Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we’d be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn’t even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don’t trust that she wouldn’t try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn’t even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They’d send me videos to watch etc. I’d humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don’t need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won’t want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave. By setting this boundary I have been told I’m in the wrong and should be able to hear everything and listen to them. I said I would if reputable sites could be used. I get the how do you trust any sites? . I cannot do it anymore however I am in the mourning part right now as they have chosen to not talk with me anymore unless I want to talk about what is being said on the very right wing sites.

1147,I think I lost my brother.,"My brother, and to a similar extent, his wife, have always been what I call ""Big R"" Republicans. I'm on the west coast, they're in the South East.  We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

It saddens me to think that he's spending his days hoping for a violent overthrow of the government.  It saddens me to think that he's so far down the rabbit hole that anyone in his family that disagrees with him is worth casting aside.",QAnonCasualties
1148,What is the common denominator??,"My person is someone who will not say he qanon, however after years of listening to him, I would say he is q-light. He doesn’t believe all the way to the blood drinking cabal part of it, but he floats around and sympathizes with most everything else, especially anything relating to Trump. He also has a general love of and interest in conspiracy theories in general. 

He is a smart man, a professional with a masters degree, upper middle class, is a decent person, a good family man, a contributing member of society. If you met him you would Never think he believes what he believes. 

What has absolutely boggled my mind over the last five years or so is WHY the hell does he fall for or at the very least sympathize with this stuff, and other conspiracy theories in general. 

In an effort to figure it out, I was wondering does your person have any of the following characteristics (which mine does). I ask because my theory is that these characteristics make him more vulnerable to following this crap. 

1.  Smokes probably way too much weed for years and years. 
2. Has an addictive personality. 
3. Grew up in an authoritarian household. 
4. Has low self esteem. 
5. Has a ridiculously low tolerance for uncertainty in life. 
6. Has a lot of anxiety. Actually on medicine for it.

1150,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

1154,I feel ashamed my dad has fallen for QAnon,"I’m from the UK, I feel like the QAnon influence isn’t as strong here than the US but still my dad has fallen deeply under it’s influence. He believes Pizzagate and that Biden and Harris are also evil somehow. Trump is meant to be some saviour that’s going to out them. Coronavirus isn’t real, the vaccine isn’t to be trusted, it’s all just to control us. It’s exhausting to have to listen to, luckily I don’t live with him and due to lockdown I haven’t really had to see him. However, even in the 15/20 mins I talked to him on my brothers birthday this weekend was ruined by him talking QAnon, he suggested that Criminal Minds was similar to conspiracy theories as “you know that something bad has happened so you investigate and collect evidence to prove it.” He also brought up how COVID isn’t real and that Biden was going to die. 
I looked up to my dad so much growing up and now this is the man he’s become. I feel like he’s an idiot now. The conspires nearly eclipses the rest of his character he talks about them so often, it’s draining to be around him. He is a loving father, he hasn’t been perfect but he is my Dad and I love him.

Some days I come here as an emotional uplift, to remind myself that it's not just me going through this, but other days I come here and within minutes I'm far more depressed than I was, because I see nothing but cries for help, and person after person telling their story about how they just lost a loved one.

 I know from my own experiences with my wife, that most Q people either wouldn't even consider doing it, or would relish the opportunity to drop their version of knowledge on you, but there's a part of me that wonders if the overwhelming amount of posts from desperate people who've lost their loved ones to Q would be enough to appeal to the heart of some of them. There's a part of me that knows my wife still has a heart, and that beneath the angry, bitter, matter-of-fact, disgusted with anybody who disagrees with her exterior, there's still a woman who can feel compassion for others. I just wonder if anybody has tried something like that, and if so, what the results were. Personally, for as curious as I am, I'm also too nervous to try it, for fear that it'll expose my one outlet for support, and I'll be patronized for having it.",QAnonCasualties
1158,Finally it all Came to a Head (Q family),"I guess the thing I have been avoiding for the last year and a half happened back in January– politics has created a divide between my family and I. It's not like that divide hadn't been there but I spent a great deal of time trying to prevent those differences from coming between us. Yet, I found myself constantly being a target of the anger and frustration they have with the left. 

For years, since I was at least 18, I have tried to navigate political interactions by example with my family and also because I don't handle conflict well. I knew part of my family's problem was the feeling of lack of respect, acknowledgement, and understanding they felt. In that sense, I felt it was my role to demonstrate that those things were not representative of all democrats. Despite this, I have spent the past year and half feeling isolated, attacked, and hurt by my family as they have dug deeper into Anon. 

At first, I had no idea where these ideas were coming from, that they believed Democratic party was evil. My family are evangelical christians, with my Uncle becoming a pastor in January 2019, so in large, I just assumed it was the biblical explanation. The thing that always stuck out like a sore thumb was despite the claims of widespread corruption, Trump was the ""chosen one"", above everything else everyone else was guilty of.  

Eventually I bit the bullet about a year-ago and asked where all of this information was coming. The accusations of pedophilia ring of devil worshiping democrats, they said was supported by evidence, and were constantly watching videos that supported this claim. My Uncle informed me that it was someone named Q, who was likely a high-level government official in the Trump administration, who shares information to expose the deep-state. These posts started on an anonymous platform but because the deep state is trying to prevent the spread of the truth he's had to jump from different platforms. Further, sometimes Q purposefully shares incorrect information to throw people off. 

At that, I became even more doubtful than I already was. I felt that it was still important to hear them out, because I'm young and there are a lot of things that I don't know. I'm currently a political science major, and I guess the biggest takeaway I've gotten was that the more you know, the less you know. I highly doubted the validity of what my family was saying, finding myself concerned as my Uncle spread QAnon content and theories to his congregation as fact, it felt like this... ""cult"" (for lack of better word) that would infect the susceptible.

Things got worse over the summer and past fall. My Uncle was convinced the end time was coming and that there would be war in the US come November. I was home with little options to get out of the house, and it began to felt suffocating. Things that I felt weren't debatable or partisan obviously were. News reports that I would listened to as I biked or ran from the NYT or NPR about the epidemic, I quickly found were dismissed and irritated them. 

I have been constantly told that my school is guilty of indoctrinating me, the education is a liberalizing force, questioned if I could really be Christian, if I am a moral person.  That I am guilty based on my vote, of sentencing my Uncle to jail because they will prosecute him for speaking about politics to his congregation. My Dad (who died when I was 13) would have voted for Trump, what happened to make me liberal?

Leading too my Uncle attending the Trump rally in D.C. January 6th, where he was pepper sprayed. I don't believe he was part of the violence that occurred at the Capitol, but I was concerned as a family member for his safety. With those tensions already high, and myself feeling that sometimes inaction and silence are worse, I shared a post. 

I woke up the following morning to texts from my Aunt. Admittedly, she's the person I'm closest too, I called confused, but she laid into me and saw it as me turning against them. The entire conversation she spent irate and I was in tears, and honestly concerned for our relationship.

I live in a very conservative area (my neighborhood is still riddled with Trump flags) and work in a conservative workplace that doesn't exactly discourage political discussion at work.  So seeing such a large population of people also affected by this Qnonsense is a breath of fresh air...I no longer feel like I'm suffocating.

My question is more for those who have attempted some type of reconciliation with their Qparents. My mother is haranguaing me to reach out to my dad (they have been divorced for 30 years, but still talk) who cut me, my wife, and my daughter off last year after calling us ""traitors to the country"" and telling us that we needed to support Trump or he would personally report us when The Storm happened. None of us are government officials nor important people, so his threat didn't make a damn bit of sense. Further Qnonsense my dad has done: cut off his two living brothers and their families as well as his step-mom, my Grandma Mary, who is in her 90s. Didnt go to his oldest brother's funeral because, in his words, his brother ""deserved to die anyway"" because he didn't support Trump. Gor fired from his job as a manager at Little Caesar's because he was cutting hours to employees who refused to say they would vote for Trump. Got questioned by local authorities for credible threats of violence against John Tester (senator from Montana, where he lives,) etc. Etc. Absolutely gone off the deep end and of course believes in the March 4th thing, according to my brother who is basically the only person my Dad still talks to.

My mom is not a Q type, but is a mainstream GOP Republican which comes with its own host of problems but at least she is somewhat rational. My dad is in his mid-60s and has never really taken care of himself, so I am concerned that he won't be around for too many more years.
1) is it worth even attempting to establish contact with him,
2) have any of you found any type of middle ground to at least have some type of communication with your Q parents?

- masks weaken our immune system 

- Pepsi and Coca-Cola use fetus kidneys as flavoring and artificial coloring 

- the vaccine will rewrite our dna/ imbed microchip/ kill us/ make us sterile

- [insert rich and famous person here] is a child killer/ pedophile/ Chinese spy

- Trump is our true president/savior here to stop and save us from the child sex rings

- Q and Anon are two separate entities that are quantum computer AI that recruited Trump when he became president 

- JFK Jr is still alive running the show against a super evil organization called the cabal 

- covid is a hoax. It's only a flu meant to weaken us for invasion 

- we're in world War 3 right now

- China has 225,000 troops on the boarders of Canada and Mexico (D-day was 150,000 for reference)

- [insert person she doesn't like for some obscure reason] should be shot

- Facebook/social media is trying to sell our information to the enemy to help control us and lose our freedom of speech (freedom my ass, I couldn't even say anything at home)

And the list goes on and on and on. But I absolutely see where you're coming from. I know that she just wanted to protect me and my family, but it just hurt seeing all of this hatred and anger pour out of her against people she didn't know or things she didn't like. Especially when those she did know as friends or family were cut off or disowned for even wishing Trump ill, support the democrats, or even mention disliking patriotism for our country.

But in the last year to 18 months it has completely and utterly taken over his life. He literally talks about nothing but conspiracies. All of them. He believes every single one. It is killing me. He is so angry and depressed and confrontational and just really not a nice person to be around anymore. We have two young boys - 7 and 5 - and if it weren't for them, I would have left by now. Every single topic I bring up with him, even just day to day life things, like food shopping and the kids and school etc, he manages to link to a conspiracy. We cannot have a single conversation without him responding in this way. He has YouTube on ALL DAY long. He works from home with it on, he drives with it on next to him, he sleeps with his ear phones in listening to it, we eat dinner with him listening to it and there is absolutely nothing I can say to make him stop. We argue about it constantly and I just feel so alone and distraught. I can't tell any friends or family about how he is, because they would be horrified and tell me to leave him, but I don't want our kids to go through that and this little part of me stupidly hopes that maybe one day he will snap out of it, and that if I have told everyone about our problems, they will hold it against him.

1184,PENNSYLVANIANS: Please share your story.,"Hi there,

My name is Maggie Gottlieb and I'm a producer at WPXI in Pittsburgh.

It's been weighing on me that this dangerous conspiracy theory doesn't just hurt those who follow it, but also their loved ones and, as we saw on Jan. 6, democracy as a whole.

I'm hoping to connect with users from western Pennsylvania who have been impacted by QAnon. The theory itself may be difficult for some of our viewers to understand, but putting your human stories behind it makes it clear as day.

If you're from the Pittsburgh area OR you have a relative or a friend in this area involved in Q, please feel free to email me at [mgottlieb@wpxi.com](mailto:mgottlieb@wpxi.com). If you agree to an interview, we would take all necessary steps to conceal your identity, if you prefer.

Thank you,

1185,Changes to the sub's rules to promote a strong and vibrant community,"Hello!

In the past month, this sub has grown incredibly quickly. In fact, we had more page views in January than we have had in the rest of our existence combined. For most subs, this would be a cause for celebration. But unfortunately for us, this is due to the continued growth and impact of the QAnon cult. 

Many new members are joining who are signing up not because they have friends and family affected, but out of a fascination with or fear of people affected by the cult. In response, we decided to experiment with some new rules to accommodate them. But after some consideration we have decided to reinstate Rule 7: Are You Directly Affected?

Rule 7 exists because this subreddit’s primary focus is supporting and providing guidance to people who have been directly affected by friends and family succumbing to QAnon. Unfortunately, many new members have joined who see this as a place to cultivate fear and hatred for people affected by QAnon. One of our mods, who escaped the QAnon mindset and now seeks to fight the movement by educating others, has been targeted for harassment. And heartbreakingly, we have heard that some people this subreddit set out to serve--those who are losing friends and family--no longer feel welcome here because they fear attack or ridicule for loving their friend or family member in the cult and still recognizing their humanity.

This not only harms individuals, but it is also harms our goal of limiting and reversing the spread of QAnon. It directly contradicts the advice of experts: **[""The most important piece of advice is to not criticize, condemn or judge, even if you have serious concerns.""](https://theconversation.com/how-to-talk-someone-out-of-a-damaging-cult-68930)** Above all, we do not want this sub to become a vector for misinformation, harmful advice, and hatred.

I personally began following the sub both because I knew people who were dabbling in the cult, and because I’m fascinated with radicalized online cultures in general. It doesn’t escape me that we are a support group, and that incels also started out as an [online support group](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45284455). There is a phenomenon that can afflict certain online communities--particularly when they are fast-growing, as ours is--where they can become toxic over time. People who find the support they are looking for leave, while those who remain can become focused on their loss and pain, nurturing it and stoking it in others. As the culture becomes angrier, it attracts more angry people and drives away those who don't share that outlook, creating a self-perpetuating downward spiral. ([You can find another example here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/lafahi/aita_for_not_sticking_up_for_a_friend_who_had_a/)).

Unfortunately, that does seem to be happening, in its early stages, in this community. I’m seeing an increase in posts defining our group as “good” and QAnon people as “evil”. I have seen posts fantasizing about their deaths--and justifying it because some of them fantasize about ours. I have banned users for explicitly saying that QAnon believers are no longer human. This is still only on the margins of the sub, but if it is not addressed now, it risks trapping this community into a similar mindset to QAnon--a good-versus-evil narrative that denies the humanity of others.

I will emphasize this again--*this is counterproductive and will only make the Qult harder to destroy. It gives them strength and fuels hatred in yourself.*

That said, there is no proper way to grieve. While we encourage the practice of forgiveness [for your own mental health](https://stepstoself.com/forgiveness-letter/)[1], your feelings are legitimate and your emotions are your own. Absolutely, if you are in a toxic relationship with someone in QAnon, please consider stepping back for your own sake ([though there are positive strategies of engagement with demonstrated success](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/11/955705495/their-family-members-are-qanon-followers-and-theyre-at-a-loss-what-to-do-about-i)). However, if you are coming here to stoke feelings of fear, anger, or vengeance in yourself and others, that is dangerously counterproductive to the many vulnerable people coming here for empathy and advice, harmful to your own mental health, and demonstrative that you are in the wrong sub. 

As much as possible, we want this to be a supportive community for everyone. We do not want people to feel ashamed for loving someone who has fallen victim to the QAnon cult and wanting to help them, or for having fallen down the rabbit hole themselves and climbed back out. More than anything, we are organizing here to combat the spread of QAnon, and we want to rely on the advice of experts to ensure our best chance of success. Please join us in using this as a productive community to support others and help them rescue loved ones from the cult's mindset

This is not to downplay the dangers of the QAnon cult. I fully expect there to be more violence at some point in the next few years, if not the next few months. As we all saw on January 6th, this absolutely can lead to violence for some adherents. But once more, because I simply cannot stress this enough--*If you want to fight the influence of the QAnon cult, you will NOT do it by giving in to fear, hatred, and the ""good v evil"" mindset. You will do it by promoting tactics that decrease its influence on social media and that help bring friends and family back from the edge* Fortunately, this is still a minority of people in this sub. For everyone who is here in good faith, thank you for making this a strong and welcoming community.

It is our goal to maintain a positive community focused on support and rehabilitation and we will continue to remove offensive and hateful comments. Please help us out in reporting comments that violate these guidelines. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or anyone else on the moderation team

[1] Note--Some people are misinterpreting this and reading through I am asking them to vocally forgive their Q-person. If you'd read through the link, the purpose of a forgiveness letter is actually NOT to give it to someone else, but to write it for yourself. This particular link states ""You don’t actually need to give your forgiveness letter to anyone. Its purpose is for you to work through your own feelings via the writing process, so it’s not intended for the other person’s benefit."" If you Google ""forgiveness letter"" you fill find others, some of which explicitly recommend not sending the letter (that would be my recommendation as well).

This is not about forgiving the other person for the other person's sake. Some people have done things that may be unforgivable. However, writing the letter is about helping *yourself* relieve an internal emotional burden. It's about letting go of a grudge, or of deep-set anger. It is a way for you to move on without letting the person who has wronged you continue to weigh you down. You can gain an internal sense of resolution without ever contacting this person again. If you are struggling with anger at someone in your life for any reason, I would recommend trying it out.

My Q father cannot accept any of this. He is constantly trying to get me to take all these different supplements, do these crazy workouts, drastically alter my diet (my diet is already pretty healthy, by drastic I mean he thinks I should only be eating chicken and spinach. Literally), only drink water from an $800 filter, ect. I understand his concern, but none of that will actually help my issues (I've already tried more reasonable versions of some of his suggestions). It's also frustrating because my doctors suspect that all the supplements (23) he had me on as a child/teenager contributed to my thyroid issues. (For context, I was overdosed on iodine droplets and colloidal silver for 6 years) .

He will not accept that I was born with Endometriosis, even though it runs in the family on my moms side. He is convinced I got it from a tetanus shot. I haven't even told him about my thyroid issues because I don't want to deal with it. He also refuses to believe I have chronic inflammation, he thinks I am just fat and have diabetes. (For more context, I have been tested for diabetes multiple times, all negative. And my inflammation is in weird places, most people think I have tumors or cists, its very obvious its not fat).

1199,Losing my mom to FB/Qanon,"I've been a lurker for a few weeks now but tonight I had to let it all out. 

My mom is/was one of the sweetest, most caring people imaginable, even in the small ways - sending candy on Halloween, liking and commenting on FB posts, texting to say how proud she was of me. She went out of her way to make me feel special. As the only child, I took it for granted. 

Now, that's over. A few weeks ago, I texted her to see how she was doing. She was always pro-Trump, and even though both my fiance and I are stringent Democrat voters, we had plenty to talk and laugh about. This time, she told me she couldn't respond because she was too enthralled with ""interesting"" videos. Fearing the worst, I asked what the videos were about. She told me the videos were about the Deep State, and how Trump is going to be reinstated back in March, and all this other stuff about Democratic child trafficking and DC not being a part of the US and so on. I was heartbroken, and tried to get her to explain and talk to her about how this wasn't real, but she wouldn't listen. My mom is a really sensitive person - something I've dealt with my entire life - so I know my words (and even just the questioning) hurt her. She told me to do my ""own research"", and sent my fiance messages on FB (I'm not on FB anymore thank God) about Jewish cabals and all that. My fiance is, of course, Jewish, and found this offensive. Since neither she nor I responded after that, she's been silent and even unfriended my fiance - something I never thought possible, even though it's a small and otherwise completely insignificant act. There been no contact, and I know my already Q-friendly aunt and uncles are egging this behavior on, feeding her more lies and bullshit. It was hard enough losing them, but my mom is another level.

It's breaking my heart. My mom and I were really close. My parents divorced when I was really young, and I lived with my mom solo until I was 18 and left for school. We talked all the time. This was the woman who would randomly text me that she loved me and was proud of who I became. She was my #1 cheerleader. Now I get nothing except the fear that she's going further into the abyss. I'm going to lose her, and for nothing. I wish I had a sibling to talk to, and my fiance helps me through this, but I need some help on what to do with my mom. I am so damn depressed that it is breaking me. I don't know if I can do this.

1204,Worried about my mom,"TLDR: I’m worried my mom is going to slip into the Q stuff on FB soon, but I can’t have conversations about this with her because she gets extremely defensive. 

I want to preface this with the fact that I’m 20, in college, and still heavily financially dependent on my parents even with a job of my own. This is what I am living with, not just dealing with from afar - luckily, I will be moving back for Spring semester soon.
My mom recently posted to Facebook about her frustration surrounding President Biden ending the Keystone XL pipeline and people loosing “thousands of jobs,” which of course, is misleading - 1,000 jobs were lost but only 50 were permanent positions, the rest temporary. Still sad for those who lost a job, but a much smaller scale issue than she was making it out to be, and this was a move toward more clean energy.
Lots of people commented supporting her frustrations, and it all somehow turned into a conversation about election fraud. People were posting their “evidence” that the election was stolen, and she liked every single comment about this claim but never commented anything herself. She did not like comments that were refuting election fraud.
This is my first time finding out she thinks the election was stolen, based on the comments she liked. She spends a lot of time on Facebook, and lives in a conservative talking point echo-chamber with the exception of me, who is the opposite of this. 
I’ve had convos about these types of topics before with her and she shuts them down immediately. She tells me that I’m putting her down, trying to demean her, and trying to act like she’s stupid for believing the things she believes. 
So now I am worried. She is already primed to not listen to anything I have to say, and she is a prime candidate for slipping into a FB hole of QAnon. Middle-class, white, Christian, conservative, never-left-small-town-USA.

I’m really not sure what to do from here. I feel absolutely hopeless. Do I let her do what she does, possibly slip into this mess, and then hope that she gets out of it eventually? I don’t know. I can’t even look for signs that she’s starting to get Q because she refuses to talk about these subjects with me for the reasons listed above.",QAnonCasualties

1209,I think I have a mild case of stockholm syndrome with my Q family members,"Hi all,

I've posted here before, but I noticed the other day my SIL has just discovered Marjorie Taylor Greene, Madison Cawthorn, and Matt Gaetz. Instead of going back to some sense of normalcy or to just being a person who voted for Republicans, but disagreed policy wise with Democrats, she's gone even further down the far-right, fringe, rabbit hole.

I thought there might be a small chance she might actually quit being some inflammatory after Biden was elected, and nothing Sidney Powell or any other major people who believe in Q ever happened. She's just gotten worse though. She's gone ever further in her hatred for Democrats and the left, and still believes Democrats, progressives, etc are trying to destroy the country.

I found myself wanting to apologize for the way things went down between us the other day (as I'm not a person who likes being in conflict with people, especially family). I then realized that would be wrong, because I don't have anything to apologize for. I wrote down things she's said to me in a google doc awhile back, and it was honestly so hateful and bigoted. I mean these are things she's actually said to me:

* “BRAINWASHED”
* “You literally vote to murder babies”
* “Your ignorance and blind eye to your support for destruction of humanity is utterly mind blowing”
* “Do you even have a job?”
* “I asked because I wanted to know your first hand real world experience with the climate of our nation right now”
* DO YOU EVEN HEAR YOURSELF!! Does nothing else in the entire world matter except who you have sex with?!!!!! WAKE THE HELL UP! There IS more to life!!!
* “I don’t know if you know God. I don’t know if you are saved. But think about your future...your real future”
* “Your so far down the rabbit hole it’s scary”
* “The sheep will be led”
* Your comment here literally proves you are being led, fed and guided. You don’t research independent sources or Republican sources because if it’s something you disagree with it must be propaganda....
* I think you have done an extensive job of educating yourself with the approved material/subjects provided by the left. I do not think whoever, you have taken an open-minded real world approach to any of your political decisions.
* You are more likely to get “bashed” for being a straight white male in 2020 than for being gay, and oh don’t you dare let anyone know you are conservative, the left will try to DESTROY you! FACT! But I know this is a fear tactic told to you by the left. This is where “lead to believe” comes into to play again. Seriously this sentence really opened my eyes to what you’re being lead to believe.
* Being straight, gay, Bi or what I call Trans-convenient is a choice or a preference.
* I absolutely believe in discrimination; we’ve turned it into an evil word. I also feel like we use discrimination wrongly. We use it consistently when someone doesn’t meet stipulation and/or distinctions are required.
* If you never are allowed both sides of the story (the true story) how can you be certain of what you’re fighting for if you don’t know who you’re fighting against?
* My one request is that for just a moment would you step back and look at the US as a whole, as one people and ask yourself what you can do and/or is what you are doing for the better of the country as a whole.

Writing it out really helped, because it reminded me just how unhinged, needlessly cruel, and vindictive she actually is. But I still find myself wanting to try and reconcile. Part of me thinks if I were to start a reconciliation process, then maybe we could get back to normal somehow. Or maybe that side of the family wouldn't be so horrible to me. But then I think about how that would be debasing myself, and how it's been months since we had a falling out, and not once has she apologized or even thought about doing so to me. She's incapable of admitting she's wrong.

I guess I'm just writing into the reddit void at this point, but has anyone else felt like this with their abusive Q people?

Thanks for listening!",QAnonCasualties
1210,"He was my cousin, and now he’s gone (repost)","Hi there, I’ve been reading through this forum all weekend and it got me thinking.

I had a cousin we recently lost, partly due to lack of medical treatment. 

To rewind, Qcousin was actually my mum’s cousin (my first cousin once removed). Mum doesn’t have any siblings so her cousins are kinda the equivalent of aunts and uncles to me. As a child, I adored Qcousin and he always made time for me at family gatherings. 

He was a musician; a guitarist and singer/songwriter. He worked as this along with other odd jobs to pay the bills. My cousin was one of the kindest, gentlest people I knew. I was very close to my grandmother and he was her favourite nephew.

Fast forward to 2020 and I see he’s a Trump supporter via FB. I was so shocked I messaged his daughter (there had been some sort of online scuffle and I wanted to support her). She said he’d gone down a few rabbit holes online. The usual stuff – Bill Gates, the “elite”, microchips, “plandemic”, global cabals – with a side of Big Foot (apparently he believed in that). This was obviously hard for my younger cousin as she basically felt she had lost her dad. She couldn’t communicate much with him, and he was always tagging her in conspiracy-related posts on FB. 

I was astounded as those conspiracies are less prevalent here, and he didn’t seem to fit the stereotype. However what I am learning is that the stereotype doesn’t really hold true. I see so many posts here saying their Q is very educated, was previously very liberal, is a kind-hearted person, etc etc.

Sadly my cousin passed away in October last year. The medical information I have was passed through his sister, to my sister, and then to me, so I am not 100% sure of all details. But essentially it seems he neglected his own medical care and passed away due to complete liver failure. He was only 59. I saw a photo of him before he passed and he looked 80. It was the most unexpected shock to our family as he did not drink whatsoever; idk what caused it. I don’t know if he could have been saved by earlier intervention but either way it appears he did nothing until he was literally yellow and as bloated as though he were about to give birth. Truly horrific. And I now wonder if his skepticism about doctors was linked to his doubts about covid, banks, the government, etc etc. 

I wasn’t sure if he was into QAnon specifically, so I went and had a look at his FB page (it has been memorialised). I didn’t spend a huge amount of time there as it felt a little ghoulish, but I believe I saw enough to get a sense of where he was at. And sure enough, there were Q-specific posts. There was also an unabashedly racist meme that came as a shock. I just can’t marry that with the idea of who I thought he was. It’s incredibly upsetting.

So basically, I’m working with a few educated assumptions here. It did seem that my cousin was into QAnon. He did pass far too soon, and seemingly without sufficient medical attention. There is universal healthcare here so it wasn’t a question of money. I do think it’s very likely his conspiratorial views influenced his self care. 

And that’s why I wrote this post. There are real world consequences to this garbage. It is not harmless. My late cousin had a wife, two adults kids, and two grandkids. His sister lost not only him last year, but also their father (who also passed away due to his age). He was loved by all of us. Even his ex wife was still his friend and cared for him at the end. My cousin perhaps could have lived to a ripe of age of 88 like his dad did, had he sought medical care. 

I’m still getting my head around this. I can’t do much to help on here but I do have a large Twitter following (same handle) I can use to help raise awareness. Might keep that for another post though where we can share ideas. Thank you all for listening and hope my contribution can help a little. This is a long road.",QAnonCasualties

1215,QDad Fall And Recovery,"Gonna be a LONGG ONE… but feels good to write.
It really began with my mother, for years and years she was fighting with mental illness brought on by both genetics and a traumatic childhood. She tried to do her best to make sure me and my siblings never faced what she had- refusing to send us to public school and instead trying to teach us herself, which never worked out and caused a lot of stress in my parents relationship as she could do less and less for us. My dad divorced her when I was eleven and I lived with the shell of my mother for a year, a person who was just unable to care for herself or my younger siblings. I ended up going through absolute hell raising two toddlers and a 36 year old woman until she just up and left one day, abandoning everyone and everything. It hit everyone hard, especially my dad who was desperate for answers, he struggled to grasp what had happened and his search for something more led him deep into MGTOW/to the incels. In the middle of me trying to recover from what had happened and grasp the public school system he really began to force these ideas about woman onto me, how I was supposed to be. Many times my depression was pushed aside as being ""my fault"" because woman are hormonal. He pushed this idea of me, a by now 13 year old, being a mother to my young siblings- how much I looked and acted like her (whether that was good or bad depended on the day) pushed ideas that women are all naturally inclined to screw people over and I have to rise past it. I listened to every word and would repeat it- I knew nothing better and considered my dad a savior after the whole situation with my mother. It wasn't long after the election he became pro trump and started to really go off about pizzagate and other strange things that I once again just rambled off, by this point I was being treated basically just like a fill in for mother. I cared for my siblings anytime he wasn't around- he took advantage of this and soon I never knew when he was home, I helped around the house so much he just kind of stopped doing anything, listened to his work issues or political rantings, I did anything he expected really. I was never thanked, I felt useless, was so deeply depressed and couldn't figure out why so I just kept blaming my mom. I did have a large support group who happily stood by me and helped me find myself, I realized I was gay and ended up coming out to my dad.. never have worse things been said to me nearly 4 years later, he called me a brainwashed liberal and words I will not repeat. i never listened to my friends who tries to point out my dad was the issue, or his abusive behavior, I made every excuse and just fell into self hatred because if everything he said was right, the world was a dark dark place and I was part of the problem. By 16 things got awful, all he ever talked about to us was politics. Q rantings- Trump train ""god emperor"" how LGBTQ is awful (knowing fully well I'm a lesbian) BLM is apart of the socialist agenda and all of it coinsides with Hollywood and Democrats deepstate sacrificing children and drinking their blood…. Any conversation with him ended in him screaming at me and me just having to leave to cry. 

It all came to a head one day when an ex friend started talking bad about me and when I vented he went off about the first amendment, I got so angry and the conversation ended so badly when I finally stood up for myself he threated to kick me out once I turned 17 and that I'd better get emancipated quick.. little did he know I had connections, by the morning I told him we needed to work out when I'd be out and he acted like i was betraying the family, however it was an eye opener that he could actually lose me and my siblings who already were beginning to dislike him especially for what they've seen him do to me. He actually got a grip, stopped drinking, stopped politics, anything with Q gone and calls Qanon crazy now.. hes repaired his relationship with my siblings, my sister is now the age I was when he really went of the deep end.. he gets a chance with them.

I never get those years back though, i never get parents. I cant view him as my father when all I was to him was a replacement wife, I can't view my siblings as anything less then my children and it makes it so hard to leave home here soon(I'm almost 18). I don't think I can ever have a relationship with my dad and honestly think I will cut all ties when I can.. when I emotionally cut him out I finally found love for myself, I found beauty in the world and more importantly I found acceptance. The ability to accept what has happened and to find the courage in it to move forward.. it's hard everyday, but it's easier then before and I'll always find hope in that.

""You know the government will never love you more than I will. It's my job to care and I'm not going to stop caring. I'll never understand the arrogance of people thinking they know more than everybody else and wanting to shut people down who have actually done the research.  Nobody says hey I was just wondering what leads you to have the opinion that you have. They'd rather just get rid of their own mother sister daughter whatever. It's insane but then again look at how everybody else is acting too. This country wants to get rid of half the population for being conservative truth-tellers. It's completely insane and terrifying but I guess the other half of the population is fine with it. We aren't doing anything wrong. We've always been accepting, we've always been nice, the stuff they say is a lie and if you guys want to believe it that's your business. But you should know that when you start believing the TV over your own mother to the point where you actually want to get rid of her instead of having a conversation, that's when you should realize that there is a serious problem going on with this country. If that doesn't tell you something then I don't know what will.  That's all I'm going to say about it. You can delete it without reading it you can block me you can do whatever you're going to do but I'm not going to stop talkin about a completely benign and honest subject.  If it were me in your shoes I would respect your Viewpoint and ask you how you arrived at that conclusion instead of kicking you to the curb but like I said I can't do anything about it so you have to do what you have to do. 💕""",QAnonCasualties

1223,Telling the world about the damage of QAnon,"Good afternoon,

My name is David Gilbert, I'm a journalist with VICE News. I've been covering QAnon for a while now and in recent months, as the profile of the cult has skyrocketed, one of the things I believe has not been covered or highlighted sufficiently is the damage that QAnon does to followers, their families, and friends. Too much of the coverage has been pointing-and-laughing rather than understanding the damage QAnon does.

So, I've been given the green light by my editors to put together a series of articles that will give a voice to those stories. I want to speak to the families and friends of QAnon followers who would be willing to share their stories, and help highlight just how dangerous this cult can be.

You can message me here, email me on [david.gilbert@vice.com](mailto:david.gilbert@vice.com) or if you want to speak more confidentially, I'll happily share my Signal/WhatsApp/Telegram number with you.

Please share this request with anyone who you think would like to tell their story.

My poor spouse doesn't want to isolate their parents, but I feel for them so much. I was the one with the crazy religious mom, so this sort of behaviour isn't unfamiliar to me. But my spouse has never had to deal with this sort of thing. It's new and sudden and distressing. My MIL has always been...assertive? A bit aggressive, but secular and protective like a mother bear. She has always been an invested, loving parent for her children and to see her be so consumed by these cult beliefs is strange and somewhat alien. It's all she ever talks about anymore. She sends my spouse these videos and posts and groups and I can see how my non-confrontational, more passive partner wants to snap her out of it, but can't for fear of losing her.

My name is Daniel Green. I am a journalist and graduate student in the Specialized Journalism program at the University of Southern California.

For the series, each student is producing an installment based on this topic.

For my part, I decided to feature the family and friends of Qanon followers. The podcast will focus on personal experiences with Qanon and how it affected your relationships. Additionally, it will discuss moving forward after the Trump Administration.

I understand that this can be a deeply personal issue, but if you think you may be interested in speaking with me about your experience, I would love to have a conversation. I can be reached at [djgreen@usc.edu](mailto:djgreen@usc.edu), Signal, or Telegram.

1229,I don’t even know where do begin,"I was directed here by some kind people on another platform, and by my sister who saw a few red flags from my partner and gently brought up a few things about QAnon to me, as I am very sheltered and naive. I don’t often come online as my partner works in internet security and knows everything I do online at home. I knew very little of QAnon until just after the inauguration of President Biden.   
I knew my partner of 20 years had become a different person in the last 4 years; nasty, screaming at me for my liberal views, I honestly thought maybe he was suffering from early onset dementia. I never thought he was caught up in anything this crazy.

I had no idea his views were so delusional until he confessed to me right after the inauguration that he was “so disappointed“ the President, Vice President etc. weren’t arrested, executed etc. His words. He became angry when I tried to gently ask him more. 

Does this mean he wants liberals, like me, to suffer? How do I find out how deep his hatred and delusion goes? I’ve noticed shifts in his attitudes towards people who aren’t like him over the past few years, but these beliefs are mostly frowned upon in our family and with our friends. He hides most of it. He’s the father of my kids, I can’t just run. I have no idea where to start looking for information on this.",QAnonCasualties

They're the ones the gave into white supremacist conspiracy theories. They're the ones that abandoned their friends and family. They're the ones who want to murder non-Q's and subject everyone to their world view. Then when it all fell apart they still have the nerve to claim victimhood. 

Why is it on us to be their punching bags? Is it not acceptable to say ""enough is enough""? Even in their supposed recovery they're still abusive and manipulative. 

Where does this come from? Why is it suddenly the responsibility of normal people to accept them after what they did? That's not unity or healing. Unity and healing only happens when the Q's accept responsibility for what they did, acknowledge the people they harmed and make sincere attempts to make amends.",QAnonCasualties

Q is a high-security level clearance given to Intelligence operatives. Supposedly, QAnon was started by such a person. However, [Gregg Housh](https://www.amazon.com/Unmasked-Inside-Internets-Powerful-Collective/dp/1469282941) (whom I met in the context of his organizing protests against Scientology all over the world), one of the original Anonymous founders, told me he knows the people who started QAnon! It was intended as a total joke. A goof on Trumpers. It was only when they realized they could sell merchandise and make money that they really expanded it. Then, the Russians got involved.

To QAnon true believers, they read  and try to decipher Q-drops which are cryptic puzzles that need to be  figured out. However, for those people, like Travis View who has been  covering QAnon since the beginning, they have documented that most of  the “drops” and prophecies have not come true. Experts in Alternate  Reality Gaming (ARG) say that [QAnon is just a sick and dangerous alternate reality game](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/opinion/qanon-conspiracy-theory-arg.html)  that people think is real! People are being deceptively recruited and  programmed to become cult members by the millions on social media  platforms. Jim Stewartson believes he has discovered a central Q figure  and his name is[ Jim Watkins and there is ample evidence that the Russians are using him](https://medium.com/@registrarproject17/jim-watkins-is-q-the-russians-are-helping-him-and-other-adventures-b457848e210b), in likely alliance with some former high-level intelligence and military intelligence figures like [Michael Flynn](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/07/to-celebrate-the-fourth-michael-flynn-posts-a-pledge-to-conspiracy-group-qanon/) and [Michael Scheuer](http://www.non-intervention2.com/2020/08/20/on-qanon-perhaps-one-should-never-say-never/) who have echoed Q propaganda publicly.",QAnonCasualties

The reason I have and will continue to compile these lists as become to realise and recently come more aware that tens of thousands of family, friends, wifes, husbands have had relationships and marriages destroyed. The phsycolgoical warfare and extent of damage cast on society by extremist groups using the internet.

""How did this happen to them?""  ""What can do to help my family member or friend?"" These as such are ludicrous conspiracies such as cornovirus is a hoax, or vaccines have microchips, or don't work, antivaccers, flat earthers or deepstate believers.  All of this is related under conspiracy, I will continue to edit and update this post. Please feel free to add any information and investigative books, or video's that have perhaps helped you understand the psychological impact. For even more information on the those impacts go to www.reddit.com look up subreddit r/qanaoncasualties to read the horrorific stories of people who have been affected by this group.  This also relates to the more recent events of the storming of the USA captial, how hate group white supremacy groups used Qanon as fanatical cannon fodder, as more smaller organized hate group members moved in to take hostages along with indoctrinated people into these hate groups.  Please pass this on to any relevant groups, these have helped me so far.

I hoped that after the inauguration she would be able to recognize the deception and move forward but that is clearly not going to happen.

Her words cut me deeply. She continues to suggest that I am uneducated and stupid. IT is offensive, as I watch her spiral deeper into her ridiculous insanity.

I literally do not know what to do anymore. I have tried to set boundaries and she plows right through them. I have tried to ignore her and she just keeps sending more.

At first I didn’t think much of it because he’s a very spiritual person and is always saying loony stuff like that, but when I get home I find out that my roomie and my other friend had spent the time when I was away with a Qanon believer and fellow spiritual person who’s converted them into the Q cult. 
Since then they haven’t been able too talk about anything else but reptiles, kids underground, adrenachrome and how Donald Trump is our savior. This turn of events in their world view have made me and my other friends concerned for their well being and grip of reality.
We have tried to talk some sense into them by showing them videos debunking this nonsense that they believe in, but nothings work because and I quote “we’re just showing them fake news and need to open our eyes to the truth”
One of our biggest challenges in this situation is our friends belief in the calibration system created by David R Hawkings, which is a meditation practice where you use your fingers to find universal truth.

^(Don't  use words like ""conspiracy theory"" or ""brainwashed."" That could cause  people to avoid you entirely, spend more time online and slide further  down into the QAnon world.Michael Kennedy / for NBC News) 

September 11, 2020 By Steven Hassan, founder of the Freedom of Mind Resource Center

Nineteen  years ago Friday, attacks by the Islamist terrorist cult Al Qaeda took  place on American soil, followed by conspiracy theories that the CIA  bombed the World Trade Towers and the Pentagon. These have been [thoroughly debunked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uskEP89S-ec), but they have still flourished, as Al Qaeda did itself until the U.S. took the threat seriously.

Now we face another dangerous cult that has inspired  political conspiracy theories and could once again do the U.S. homeland  damage: QAnon. The shadowy internet-based organization's followers[ believe](https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-qanon.html?searchResultPosition=1)  that the world is run by a global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles  and child sex traffickers who are plotting against President Donald  Trump and his supporters and that only Trump can save us. There is great  concern that QAnon might turn violent, particularly if Trump loses the  election.

According to QAnon, those[ involved](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/08/21/qanon-supporters-may-be-behind-hundreds-of-in-person-save-the-children-rallies-planned-for-saturday/#6ffd44487501) in the plotting include ""deep state"" government bureaucrats, Democrats and celebrities. QAnon also appears to be spouting [Nazi anti-Semitic tropes](https://www.justsecurity.org/72339/qanon-is-a-nazi-cult-rebranded/), and it uses[ biblical](https://theconversation.com/the-church-of-qanon-will-conspiracy-theories-form-the-basis-of-a-new-religious-movement-137859) references, as some are convinced that Jewish bankers want to enslave people and incite world wars, [evoking an out-and-out Nazi cult](https://www.justsecurity.org/72339/qanon-is-a-nazi-cult-rebranded/). They have recruited anti-vaxxers who are espousing [distrust of virus experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/qanon-right-wing-influencers-fauci-deep-state-clinton), believe [Bill Gates wishes to put chips](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/technology/bill-gates-virus-conspiracy-theories.html) into people and think [5G cell towers are dangerous](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/24/21231085/coronavirus-5g-conspiracy-theory-covid-facebook-youtube).

Before you dismiss QAnon as another kooky ideology, consider that it's gaining popularity — and quickly. There are[ millions](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/qanon-groups-have-millions-members-facebook-documents-show-n1236317) of QAnon (pronounced ""KEW-a-non"") adherents in the United States, with entities established in more than[ 71 countries](https://www.voanews.com/usa/how-qanon-conspiracy-theory-went-global). And their conspiracy theories have[ seeped](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/30/qanons-conspiracy-theories-have-seeped-into-u-s-politics-but-most-dont-know-what-it-is/) into the political landscape in significant ways.

Trump[ supporters attach](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/14/asked-about-qanon-trump-declines-denounce-conspiracy-theory/) a ""Q"" to their signs. Forbes has[ named](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2020/08/01/twitter-cracked-down-on-qanon-but-candidates-touting-the-conspiracy-there-still-thrive/#11bbb5d85e9e) 15 congressional candidates who have promoted QAnon. Trump himself has[ retweeted](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/12/trump-tweeting-qanon-followers-357238)  many QAnon followers, and when he was asked about it by a reporter who  referred to QAnon's ""belief that you are secretly saving the world from  this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals,"" [Trump responded](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-qanon-conspiracy-theory-suppose-be-bad-thing-n1237358), ""If I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it.""

QAnon  poses a serious threat to society, and not only because it's spreading  misinformation about certain groups of people. Adherents have been[ accused](https://www.insider.com/qanon-violence-crime-conspiracy-theory-us-allegation-arrest-killing-gun-2020-8) of acts of violence, including attempted kidnapping and attempted murder. The FBI has[ named](https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-documents-conspiracy-theories-terrorism-160000507.html?soc_src=hl-viewer&amp;soc_trk=tw)  QAnon followers as ""conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists."" Some  members of Congress have been so concerned about QAnon that the House  recently[ introduced](https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/malinowski.house.gov/files/QAnon%20Resolution%208.25.20.pdf) a resolution calling out QAnon's ""capacity to radicalize to violence individuals at an alarming speed.""

Scariest of all can be when QAnon rears its head close to  home, in the form of people you know starting to talk about the ""truth""  they've discovered from QAnon. If this happens and you want to steer  them away from these beliefs, hopefully for good, it's important to know  what to say — and what not to say.

While not all followers are ""brainwashed"" by all of its beliefs, QAnon [is a destructive cult](https://freedomofmind.com/qanon-and-the-bite-model-control-of-behavior-information-thoughts-and-emotions/) that[ operates](https://freedomofmind.com/qanon-and-the-bite-model-control-of-behavior-information-thoughts-and-emotions/) the same way all cults do. That is, QAnon recruiters and proselytizers use deceptive and manipulative tactics to[ attract](https://freedomofmind.com/influence-continuum/) people and feed them messages that trigger certain emotions to hook them and indoctrinate them into a new sense of reality.

QAnon leaders [spread](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/30/qanons-conspiracy-theories-have-seeped-into-u-s-politics-but-most-dont-know-what-it-is/ft_20-03-18_qanon_4/)  their messages through social media platforms, such as Twitter, Reddit  and YouTube. These platforms are able to algorithmically radicalize  people who are curious about QAnon using clickbait titles, images,  videos and even purported documentaries. According to alternate reality  game expert Jim Stewartson, QAnon uses online gaming techniques to[ entice](https://medium.com/@registrarproject17/qanon-is-an-enormous-alternate-reality-game-arg-run-by-malevolent-puppetmasters-27e6b098ce9b) people down an online rabbit hole, offering them a series of fantasy challenges with[ hidden code](https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-qanon.html?searchResultPosition=4) messages called ""Q drops"" that soon become addictive.

By  getting involved with QAnon, followers feel they are part of an elite  community, which gives them a sense of belonging. That's a powerful  force — but you can work against it if you take the right steps.

First of all, though, you need to protect yourself. Intelligent people  can fall prey to cult tactics, which work most effectively on those who  don't understand how they work. *This could be you.* Take the time to learn about the potential dangers of cults and conspiracy theories and how they use[ mind control](https://freedomofmind.com/what-to-do-about-the-qanon-and-those-ensnared-in-it-interview-with-travis-view/) to attract and control vulnerable people. 

My [Influence Continuum](https://www.freedomofmind.com/influence-continuum/) is a helpful guide to distinguish healthy, ethical influence from destructive authoritarian influence. My [BITE model](https://freedomofmind.com/bite-model/)  of mind control outlines the specific behaviors that mind controllers  use. Techniques include deception, confusion, hypnotic suggestions in  videos, loaded language like ""fake news"" and phobia programming — such  as the idea that not joining the cause will lead to the end of the  world.

This education will help keep you from becoming  QAnon's next victim. Then you should approach your friend or relative,  keeping in mind these guidelines:

**Engage with the person.** Appear curious  about their beliefs and how they were introduced to them. Ask what  person, social media post or video first got them interested and what  led them to take it more seriously. Connect with the person by focusing  on shared interests and experiences. This is important, because it will  help remind the person who they were before getting hooked into the  cult. It's also important to keep the conversation[ positive](https://freedomofmind.com/the-definitive-guide-to-helping-people-in-the-cult-of-trump/),  because developing rapport and trust with warmth is a key to engaging  and getting people to interact with you similarly. They have been  indoctrinated to think you have been brainwashed by the likes of the  pedophile traffickers, so it's important that they see you as a real  person.

**Don't judge.** Don't insult the  person or try to argue against their beliefs. Don't talk down to them or  call them names. Instead, act genuinely interested in what they  understand the group and its beliefs to be. Don't use terms like  ""conspiracy theory"" or ""brainwashed."" That could cause the person to  avoid you entirely, spend more time online and slide further down into  the QAnon world.

**Appeal to their sense of integrity, reason and conscience.**  Orient the QAnon believer to the idea that if something is true, it  will stand up to scrutiny. Talk about the value of research, which has  to include reading what critics and former QAnon members have to say,  not only believers.

**Suggest alternative information sources.**  Redirect the person toward legitimate news sources, social psychology  research and other sources of reliable information about how the mind  works that shed light on some of the topics QAnon uses to draw people  in, such as child trafficking. (This is especially important because  QAnon followers have[ hijacked](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/technology/qanon-save-the-children-trafficking.html) a movement to stop child trafficking.) My[ book on cults](https://www.amazon.com/Combating-Cult-Mind-Control-audiobook/dp/B07GZQMCT8/) explains this process in more detail.

**Create a team of trusted allies.** You're  just one person against a large community of cult influencers. To  bolster critical thinking and independent decision-making, talk to the  QAnon follower's friends and family members and encourage them to  reconnect with their loved one. The more time the person spends with  others and away from the QAnon chat forums, the better.

Now  that QAnon is becoming a global phenomenon, with Trump and others in  positions of power promoting it, there's a lot at stake. As we approach  the presidential elections,[ Russia](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-qanon-russia/russian-backed-organizations-amplifying-qanon-conspiracy-theories-researchers-say-idUSKBN25K13T) and the [Christian right](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/21/904798097/how-qanon-conspiracy-is-spreading-in-christian-communities-across-the-u-s) are[ promoting QAnon theories](https://theconversation.com/the-church-of-qanon-will-conspiracy-theories-form-the-basis-of-a-new-religious-movement-137859), while the cult's leaders are calling for followers on Twitter to [prepare themselves for an armed civil war](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/).  We have to be vigilant and do what we can to learn about the dangers of  QAnon so we can protect ourselves and those we care about — as well as  our democracy — from this cult.",QAnonCasualties
1247,Q source of info?,"Hi all, I’ve posted before about my mom going deep down the rabbit hole. I’m noticing one of my older co-workers beginning to repeat some of the same rhetoric.

I have a hard time responding in the moment to various conspiracies they drop into conversations because what they mention seems so far fetched- at one point my mom was dropping in Hillary going to Gitmo, the Fed being destroyed, and secret FISA warrants all in one ten minute conversation. (That was way back in March, she’s since moved on and through Bill Gates being evil, Fauci being evil, Covid is a hoax / overinflated, mole children in tunnels, Obama is a ‘treasonous bastard’, Trump will save us all, and now finally, this whole GME stock thing is being controlled by the Deep State. There’s probably 400 other conspiracies she believes in that I failed to mention.) 

I’ve come to sadly accept that my mom is pretty far gone and I try to avoid these topics with her. Unfortunately because this stuff consumes her life, we have very little to actually talk about and don’t really communicate about anything beyond surface level things anymore. Very sad because we used to be EXTREMELY close. 

Now that I hear my co-worker going down what I feel are similar rabbit holes, I find myself wondering where they are getting their info, and how we can be aware of these strange theories to help refute them. Maybe there are even hints of fact in some of them and I would like to know that before calling BS because nothing fuels them more than when us “normies” are wrong about something. My coworker was going on and on about Chinese armies being stationed around the US borders before the inauguration, and China buying up a ton of land in Texas (?) to build army bases, since Biden is controlled by China....she also fully believes armies are going to come to your house and take your guns under Biden’s direction. I’m usually caught so off guard by this stuff that I just “hmmmmm” and “oh I don’t know” my way through convos. 

Maybe it’s not worth trying to be “up” on all of the Q gossip? I don’t think it’s my job to debate all of them, but I would love to be able to refute nonsense in a factual way. 

My mom mentioned getting her Covid hoax / anti vax ideas from “some woman doctor who used to be in orthopedics and now works with viruses” so I have no clue what she is watching. She is actively encouraging me (in education, around hundreds of kids a day) to not get the vaccination- which I would get today if I could. (Supposed to happen next week- fingers crossed!)

I am sent YouTube and bitchute videos multiple times a day. I am being warned to get away, to pack my bags, to prepare for power outages, to fill my tank with gas... 

I know this sounds almost as out there as the Q belief system is, but I think there is some kind of cult, hypnotic programming going on with those videos. 

YouTube needs to take a closer look at this situation. These are videos with fake live news feeds apparently that are also deep fakes. People who aren’t media or technologically savvy will just fall for this. Apparently there is a new video that meshes Chuck Schumer accidentally saying “erection” instead of saying “insurrection” with some deep fakes of Adam Schiff and a CNN newscaster having the exact same slip up. And, then, laughably,  Q folks believe this proves that Chuck Schumer is a pedophile. What?!?!

1252,Major red flags from my dad,"My birthday was a couple of weeks back and my dad and I ate together at his house. While doing so, politics came into the mix and while he spoke I started detecting some Q talking points (pizza gate, voter fraud, etc). By what I heard, I think that he hasn’t gone too deep as his comments were fairly general and not as detailed as other Qpeople’s but it’s clear to me that he is gravitating towards these conspiracy theories. What can I do to stop him from going deeper into Q? Has anyone dealt with this?",QAnonCasualties
1253,Dad’s Q lifestyle starting to affect me socially,"I moved out of california and came to idaho about 3 years ago with my family. my parents at the time were pretty liberal but definitely didn’t like Obama. over the course of the 3 years that i have been living here in idaho, my dad has become more and more conservative. i have absolutely no problem with him supporting Trump, as i like many others believe you should be able to support whoever you want. 

my dad started to really dive into the Q stuff this past summer and it got ugly really quickly. he began posting all these dumb extremely far right articles on his facebook or would make comments on his friends posts basically attacking them. my dad lost so many lifelong friends this summer due to these idiotic posts and comments that in husk mind, we’re completely right and justified. A lot of my friends are friends with him on facebook and they would see these dumb Q posts. they began bringing it to my attention and that’s when problems started to occur. they would ask me why he’s posting this stuff and that my dad is racist and he needs to stop. i sat down with my family and told him that the facebook posts need to stop because he’s making himself look like a fool. of course, like many others, he just argued with me and told me that liberals are evil and that all those people can kiss his ass. 

yes that is correct. people who he’s known for years and had great relationships with. they all unfriended him. it doesn’t end there. of course the election comes around and he continues posting his Q theories and all the bullshit about the election being stolen. my friends continued to screenshot his posts and send them to me and ask me why he’s posting these things. i noticed some of my friends began not talking to me as much as we had used to. i suspected it was because of my dad. then the capitol attack happened. my dad wrote a long post about how this was all Antifa and that the attacks were justified because all liberals need to go. he mentioned the blackout and the radio broadcasts and tagged my siblings and i and told us that we needed to prepare for an all out war. that was the final straw. I HAD MY DADS OWN FRIENDS MESSAGING ME ASKING ME WHY HES GONE CRAZY! i had 2 of my friends block me on all platforms. one of my closest friends barely comes over to hang out because he doesn’t want to interact with my dad at all. 

i probably sound like a broken record because a lot of the posts in this sub are similar. but i just don’t know what to even do anymore. my dads own Q conspiracies and posts on his facebook have made me lose real friends. approaching him about the issue didn’t work. what do i even do at this point.",QAnonCasualties
1254,Newly Narcissistic traits in Q followers,"I’ve been reading all of your stories on the sub, as well as dealing with Qs in my life, and the running theme I’ve noticed is an uptick in narcissistic or other Cluster B personality disorder traits in a lot of Q followers. Things like becoming extremely defensive or angry at criticism or disagreement, overstepping and simple not caring about people’s boundaries, even straight up gaslighting and manipulation. While I’m sure some Qs behaved this way even before falling into the cult, I know many of us have seen perfectly normal friends and family completely transform into pretty awful people to be around. 

If you’ve been on children of narcissistic parents forums (raisedbynarcissists is the big one on Reddit), there’s a term called FLEAS that often gets thrown around. Oftentimes, victims of narcissistic abuse adopt similarly narc traits (defensiveness, gaslighting) as a sort of survival mechanism, to live with some kind of peace in the reality of the narc. This doesn’t mean they also have NPD, but they can have lots of very toxic behavior traits. I do believe that the Q phenomenon, and to a large extent, Trump, are causing Fleas in normal people who fall into this mess. They start emulating the behaviors of these narc leaders and become toxic people who manipulate and gaslight and completely destroy their personal relationships. Over the last few years, we’ve been gaslighted and manipulated so much by a narc president and his cronies that I think the Trump era and Q’s rise has unleashed a wave of narcissistic fleas on an unassuming population. 

For some light at the end of the tunnel though... FLEAS can be unlearned, if the person is aware of the reasons for them and begin taking other people’s feelings into account again. Sometimes, even when a Q person starts to see the light again, they may still have holdover FLEAS to get rid of. It’s important to continue to set boundaries with them so we can have healthy relationships without their learned narc. traits in the future. Wishing the best for all of you and your loved ones ❤️

TL; DR: Q and Trump are narcissistic abusers who are turning our loved ones into victims of their abuse.",QAnonCasualties
1255,My grandmother...,Hi I’m new and just joined after I heard about this subreddit on a podcast. My grandmother is a sweet caring lady but she’s suffered from bipolar disorder for a long time and refused to take her medication starting a few years back. I’m 20 and moved into a trailer two down for her because I’m still young and had help from my parents to move out with my gf and decided it was a good cheap option and my grandmother recommended it. We had just reconnected a few months before I moved in after years of not speaking. Now I find out she’s shifted from left wing views to these radical right q anon conspiracies. I consider myself a conservative guy and I’m in the marine reserves but she’s just too far gone. I don’t even know how to converse with her anymore. It’s all she ever talks about and I feel like I’m slowly losing her because I can’t even have a normal conversation with her like she’s my grandma without her spouting about mass arrests and the inauguration was fake.

1260,Done with my Q-Uncle,"I finally blocked him on facebook. It honestly sucked to do that, because just a year or so ago, I worked right along side and respected this man. He seemed level headed, and honestly really down to earth. Sure, we didn't agree on some things, but we put that aside because we were family.   


But these past 4 years have just...changed him. I literally don't recognize who he is anymore. Allow me to provide a timeline:

&amp;#x200B;

Early 2019 - I was working with my dad, who, my uncle also works for. Dad was providing me a temporary job until I found a new one (Which I have), and I got to spend a lot of nice time with both of them. I never really talked to my uncle as an adult before (we weren't super close before) but I got a lot of chances to this time. Turns out, we had a lot in common! We both loved the same kind of music, we're both drummers and guitarists, we agree on some things politically, and we both really enjoy UFC. Hell, I even went over to his house once to watch a pay per view fight, which was awesome.   


Mid 2019 - I got a new job, so I stopped talking to him a lot. I still would interact with his posts on facebook, and we'd see each other occasionally, but it was scarce. Still, he seemed like the same guy I always knew. Boy, oh boy, how wrong I was.  


Late 2019 - Early 2020 - That's when the pandemic started. Masks mandates became a thing. And he was NOT having it. But, this only really manifested itself into being annoyed on facebook and complaining about it. Yeah it sucks, but oh well, nothing too big.  


Mid 2020 - This is when things started getting out of hand. Everything with George Floyd and BLM was starting to ramp up, and he LET LOOSE. He was making tons of posts about how BLM are terrorists, that they're only wanting to burn/loot places, and all this stuff. I didn't pay much mind, until I responded to one particular post that my dad had made about all this. Now, my dad is very level headed, and doesn't get heated about hardly anything. Even so, I made a comment about how police were treating POC in this country, and we went back and forth a bit. It was very civil discussion, just so you know. My dad said something, and my boyfriend happen to look at it, so he made a comment as well, which was a little heated, but my dad conceded and I thought it was left at that. Here comes my uncle coming in spewing all this crap about liberals, BLM being terrorists, anything he could think of. My boyfriend obviously retorts to this, calmly I might add, so my uncle legit threatens my boyfriend. I was honestly shocked to see this, and was about to send him a message to not threaten my boyfriend, but the bf did a great job of that himself, and after a long comment, got blocked by my uncle. I texted my dad and cousin about it, and my dad said verbatim ""Dude, my brother has lost his god damn mind."". While my cousin was a lot more dismissive, it really put me off.   


But, unfortunately, it continued. My uncle's posts just kept getting more and more crazy. I honestly thought at one point he was just gonna start calling people the n-word. That's when all the conspiracy theory crap started too. Everything was ""liberal this"" and ""hoax that"", and dear lord I think this man has a hate boner for Bill Gates (For...some reason? I still don't get that one). Started saying that Covid is a huge hoax, and that everyone who wears masks are ""sheep"". I unfriended him at this point, I didn't need to see that on my feed. But, I didn't block him yet, as I honestly just wanted to see just how crazy things would get, or what I more hoped for, how he would change back to the guy I knew.  


Late 2020 - Boy howdy was I wrong. This is when the election was happening, and Covid was getting worse and worse. He new favorite catch phrase was ""YOU ARE BEING CONDITIONED FOR CONFORMITY"" with a random string of mask and sheep emojis afterwards. His feed was just filled with videos of people 'debunking' the pandemic, and it honestly blew my mind. But when I started to get pissed off, was when he sent a picture of him on his way to my grandmother's house, no mask. My grandma is one of my most favorite people in my life, but, she has a history of heart disease, and is currently in her late 70s. Was he really going to go visit her knowing there's a pandemic going on? Luckily, I asked my dad about it, and he ended up not going, but the thought that he would so recklessly put my grandma's life in danger infuriated me.   


Then....the election happened. If you haven't guessed by now, my uncle is a die hard conservative. Every day there were multiple posts about how the election was rigged, and that votes were flipped for biden, literally every conservative talking point about how the election was fraud was on his timeline, and it started to make me sick. But, I thought that maybe after inauguration day, it would all die down and he'd be back to somewhat normal.  


Once again, I was wrong. The insurrection attempt happened on January 6th, and he was all for it. Before you ask, no, he didn't end up going. But he sure cheered these people on. You don't call someone you disagree with a 'real patriot', do you? I couldn't believe what i was looking at. The man who had touted for all his life about freedom and democracy was openly supporting the biggest attack on our democracy in over 100 years. I should have blocked him at this point, but curiosity got the better of me. I wanted to see just how insane these posts would get. I know that makes me an asshole to almost want to see it, but it's like watching a train wreck. You know it's horrible what is happening, and it breaks your heart, but you can't stop watching it happen.   


Then, inauguration day came and went. Last I saw, he was of course criticizing everything Biden has done, and still touts his crap about Covid being a hoax. I realized it was starting to affect me negatively, and talked with my boyfriend about it. I realized that honestly...I never want to talk to him again. He had said enough racist, stupid, transphobic (I didn't go over it, but a lot of his posts talked about 'there's only 2 genders' or something like that), shit that I just couldn't do it to myself anymore. I'm done. I fear for my aunt honestly, but at the same time, she's probably right there with him. I've talked to his children and even they think he's gone nuts. Hell his own brother does too.  


Now I know that a lot of this isn't directly related to Q stuff, but, a lot of the rhetoric he was spouting was from these places. His favorite buzzwords were hoax, conspiracy, conformity, deep state, drain the swamp, and a ton others. I know that a lot of them came from Q sources, and I have no doubt that he has absolutely gone off the deep end into it, he's just not advertising it as much as he wants to.   


As far as I'm concerned, my uncle isn't really someone I know anymore, and I hate how much it hurts for me to say that. I really did like him, but I couldn't watch this insanity show anymore. If he's going to family events, I won't be. I want nothing to do with him anymore. If threatening the man I love isn't enough, then all this other shit is.  


I hate this. I really do. I hate what this fucking cult has done to my family.",QAnonCasualties

1262,Wife gets deeper into this Q rabbit hole every day,"I feel so bad for everyone here dealing with this. It's kind of nice to see others in similar situations as it makes my own feel less impossible. What isn't nice is that nobody appears to be finding real solutions or positive outcomes. Maybe that group is simply not tending to post about it here.

My wife discovered this Q family of conspiracy theories through Simon Parkes just a handful of months ago, who I've come to realize is more of an entertainer and fraudster than conveyer of real information. I believe she also has support from her mother so she has someone to agree with her.

Since then, she's embraced the whole story the more she learns about it. The battle between good and evil. Gigantic child trafficking operation. The mass arrest that never came to be. The continued Trump presidency that never came to be. Trump's still commanding the military even now. The military leaves little hints here and there indicating disrespect to Joe Biden, like how they lay their flags out. She has always loved a good story and this one is like a multi-part masterpiece with great material that comes out every week. Every conspiracy is based in something that makes sense but takes it to a level that doesn't.

She tried telling me about it all one time, to educate me, and I was not receptive at all in hind sight. I happen to support what Trump brought to the US and I don't believe the military likes Biden much at all. Child trafficking *is* a big problem. I told her to be careful with unbelievable news that you can't verify at all and whose sources make no sense. After all, why would ranking military members leak this information to just that guy so he can broadcast it to his followers? Especially something like a sting operation that would obviously be best executed in secret.

So this is fairly fresh. I feel like I should have a chance to help her. She isn't violent at all and I see what she's going through as her seeking truth and justice that hasn't been provided by our primary media sources and institutional systems. The spiritual tie in almost preys on her because she likes that kind of stuff and so it makes her more likely to believe the rest. Unfortunately, she found a nonsensical place to find these things that's probably dangerous after you look under the surface. Of course, I didn't know much about how deep this conspiracy went and how cultish it really is until I researched Parkes and Q and really payed attention to the comments she's been making. The things she says are exactly this Q conspiracy.

I heard her explain to my 7 year old daughter that the Pope has been tried and executed for doing really bad things. Pretty sure that isn't true. But she educated my kid on it. How do you explain the list of people in Gitmo and who were executed for trafficking still walking around and doing things on TV? Deep fakes, obviously. I can't let this problem get worse. I have to protect my kids, as soon as I figure out how.

I'd love to hear similar stories that are further along. How is it going?

I'm obviously going to try to talk her away from this nonsense. Hope it goes well.

Edit: Wow did this turn out to be an unfriendly place. Anyways, for anyone who cares, I had the talk tonight. Went well. She ultimately agreed with me that the Q story is not real. She did not associate that whole Pope story with Q given where she heard it. It was like a lightbulb went on in her mind hearing me oppose it and warn her about Simon. We also set the record straight with my kid. I wish I had realized what was happening earlier.

Those saying ""how could I let my kid be told that story"". Geez. It was like 15 seconds of talking and I didn't already know it was a conspiracy theory. Good God some of you people in here LOL.",QAnonCasualties

1265,Lost My Hero,"For my entire life, my oldest brother was my hero.  He is ten years older than me and was always a giant.  He was larger than life.  He was my protector, and if it weren't for him and work at his construction company, I wouldn't have made it through college and law school.  When I couldn't afford a bar prep class, he wrote me a check. One of the best people I knew.  Until it all changed.  

There was a rule in my family that we never talked about politics.  Then, a few years before he passed, my father had a stroke.  Something I learned is that strokes can cause personality changes and my father (virtually overnight) went from being a union democrat to watching Fox News 12 hours a day and screaming about the liberals.  This was George W era Fox News.  Still, a political camp developed in my family with my father and this brother.  

I became a lightning rod given my job: I was indirectly in politics.  I worked in the general counsel’s office for a governor.  My day job was literally at the statehouse working on legislation.  In an insane fit of irony, I worked for a republican governor.  But he was a moderate and no friend of Fox News, so my father would fixate on it. He would scream and get worked up, I would avoid it, and they would apologize.   There came the point that a rule was developed where I couldn't talk about my job or career with my father.  The relationship healed and remained healthy until he passed.  

The reason this became important is that the seal was broken, and conservative politics became the rule of the day at family conversations.  Of my six siblings, all but one remained intensely apolitical, my oldest brother (and his wife and kids). They fed on (and fed) my father's polarized political beliefs.  The rest of us sat quietly and tried to change the subject.  

Shortly before my father’s death, we were all together and my 18-year-old nephew (his son) was there, and the conversation turned to conspiracy theories.  It all came out.  Flat Earth...check.  Sandy Hook...crisis actors (despite a friend of the family having lost a niece).  Moon landing....never happened.  That branch of the family tree were all into it.  The rest of the family grimaced but this weird refrain developed: “isn't it great they're passionate about something.”

In comes Donald Trump.  Good God, did they love Donald Trump. Pick up trucks with Trump flags.   Family gatherings are populated with MAGA hats.   All they talked about was Trump.  The rest of us grimaced, but...isn’t it great that they're passionate about something. 

We are all on social media, and it's 2015.  It's a shit show.  I try and stay out of it as much as I can, but they say hateful shit about my wife in comments to a post she made supporting LGBTQ rights. My apolitical family blows the fuck up.  Most of my siblings (and I) mostly stay out of it, but lines are being crossed every where.  They call my wife a bigot because she won't tolerate their homophobic views.  It's ugly. I do get involved in the defense of my wife.  

Trump gets elected, and the MAGA branch goes crazy.  Right before Thanksgiving, I write an email to the whole gang.   The horrible thing I say: words matter, and we need to remember we are family. The MAGA branch publically calls me a “pussy”   The non-MAGA branch shun me because I “just can't let it be”   The outcome: my MAGA brother and all of his brood unfriend my wife and me on all social media.  It's a good thing....kinda.

Then last year happens.   Their new jam: Qanon.  I hear it through my mother and indirectly on social media when posting on mutual friend’s stuff.  They're into all the shit.  Satanic pedophiles....yup.   Celebs drinking children’s blood....yeah.   Trump, Q and the “Great awakening”.....oh yeah. 

My mother has her stroke.  They say on social media the stroke is caused by face masks.  My uninvolved sister asks them to delete it because my mom doesn't want her health condition used that way.  Their text response: “where we go one we go all”.  What I found disturbing is that other members of the family “like” the text, not realizing it's a cult rallying call.  

Where were they on 1/6?   Oh yeah, the Capitol rally.  They share pics.  Did they go inside? Not sure, but the last thing I saw was a message from one of their nut job relatives saying that Pence was a traitor and that “it's on.”

So obviously, they don't think COVID is a thing.  They refuse to wear masks and peddle every conspiracy theory known to man.  The interesting thing is that my other brother is a doctor with a masters in public health and is an exec at a major health network. He’s like the COVID guy. Interviewed on TV, in the papers, he's fighting the good fight one 12 hour shift at a time. 

There's this stupid ass idea about a family gathering that he's begging everyone not to do or, if they insist, to wear masks.  He tells the story of a healthy 40-year-old coworker at his hospital that just died.  Their response: he’s infringing on their rights and “where we go one, we go all”  I beg them all not to do it and I'm called a “baby killer” (it's them playing to my mother who is very prolife)   The rest of my family’s reaction: silent acceptance as always.  My physician brother (a remarkably strong man) calls me shaken like I've never seen.  What does he say: “ you know they all think we are the crazy ones.”

Where does it stand: the MAGA branch all have COVID,  My sister in law is sick, and my brother is “symptomatic.”  Both tested positive.  The rest of the MAGA branch refuses to get tested.  One called my elderly mother, saying she wanted to stop by to visit but ultimately refused because she would have had to wear a mask, which is “against everything she believes in.”

I want to pray for their health, and I have tried.  I want to reach out.  I want to help them, but I have given up.  I have this empty spot in my soul.  I cut them out a long time ago.  I treat them as footnotes, mostly hoping that they don't do damage.  But I morn.",QAnonCasualties
1266,My Dad keeps talking about Agenda21 and the club of Rome.,"My Dad has been going on about this stuff for years.
I am not sure if it is Q related but don’t know where else to ask about this.
I think it is a new world order and globalism conspiracy.

From whatever I can tell Agenda 21 is a toothless non binding agreement to try to follow some guidelines for greener town living. But he seems to think it is a communist thing.
I have tried searching multiple times but I can’t find a community that believes in a Club of Rome conspiracy. Seems like they were a group that wrote some books 50 years ago on how to potentially tackle environmental problems and he thinks it is a global elites new world order thing.

He sent this message in response to me telling a guy the Heartland institute is evil af and not a reliable source of climate science.
It feels like a copy pasta. I’d hate to think he wrote all of this.



“nor are most of the sites and folks you are relying on for information. Anthropogenic Climate Change is an artificial construct created to bring about the movement of wealth from the rich countries to the poorer ones. 

Suggest you read the book Limits To Growth which the original publication from the Club of Rome which they followed up with The First Global Revolution (1991) 

The Club of Rome is a Neo-Malthusian organization with interlocking membership with European power elite groups such as the Committee of 300 (a secret society founded by the British aristocracy in 1727) and the Bilderberg Group.” Since its foundation in the late 1960s, the membership of the Club of Rome (and its sister organizations the Club of Budapest and the Club of Madrid) has swollen to include the Dalai Lama, Al Gore, Kofi Annan, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev, Deepak Chopra, Bianca Jagger, and Peter Gabriel, Al Gore, George Soros etc etc. 
Here is their organization’s Master Plan—as described in their 1993 publication, The First Global Revolution. 
“Now is the time to draw up a master plan for organic, sustainable growth and world development based on allocation of scarce resources and a new global economic system.”

Who voted for this stuff? No one did. That’s the point. If people like you are given any choice in the matter, you’ll almost certainly opt for the wrong thing. That’s why you need this wise über-elite of self-appointed chosen ones to make the right decisions for you: the guy from Genesis who used to dress up as a flower; the girl who used to be married to Mick Jagger; the author of Teens Ask Deepak and Synchrodestiny: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence to Create Miracles. They’ll know what to do. 

They wanted the threat to appear to be global to transcend national boundaries and thus make a single global government as the only option to save the planet. 
“The common enemy of humanity is man. In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes  and behavior that they can be overcome. 
They needed a focus, numerical evidence that appeared scientific. 
People argue they practice the Hegelian Dialectic that uses a crisis to justify action. What they are really after is a One World Government controlled by them, the unelected elite. 
Fortunately not everyone is a brain dead Sheeple swallowing their BS!
And speaking of BS read up on Maurice Strong . 

In her book Cloak of Green Elaine Dewar asked Strong why he didn’t enter politics to achieve his goal. He replied he was going to the UN where, “He could raise his own money from whomever he liked, appoint anyone he wanted, control the agenda.” 
Dewar’s experience in writing the book is revealing because it is a classic example of good investigative journalism. 

It also shows that environmentalists are not what they claim to be. They are using the environment as a vehicle to push a socialist, total government control agenda. 
Dewar planned to write a book praising Canadian environmentalists including people like Elizabeth May, David Suzuki, and Maurice Strong. In the spirit of true investigative journalism Dewar kept an open mind and did not set out to prove her hypothesis. The research showed that they were more corrupt and manipulative than the people they attacked. 
It is these folks who have driven the Anthropogenic Climate Change farce and the UN's IPCC as well as the UN's Agenda 21 and 30. 

Even the Chair of the UN's IPCC as well as other members no longer hide the truth and admit that the Climate Change movement has almost NOTHING to do with climate and EVERYTHING to do with the movement of wealth from rich western countries to poor 3rd world countries.

1267,I’ve lost my son. He’s 12.,"I didn’t make him but his mom was my closest friend and after she wound up a single mom (when the boy was 5 months old) I stepped in and have been THE man in his life - have fully supported them financially since then (I’m not wealthy by any stretch) - and he calls me dad/daddy. He’ll  be 13 on Thursday. I lived with them from when he was 2 to 7.

I could feel his mom being swallowed up last summer and as she started to share the SRA stuff with me I warned her that she was repeating Qanon talking points and that hooking into Q is dangerous because they draw you in with #savethechildren but really want you thinking #killtheliberals (she’s almost there)

She took it poorly and has denied her son and I access to each other ever since. 

I’ve had several 3+ hour talks with her to no avail. She’s like 3 people. The person I knew. An almost hysterical adherent to the SRA stuff and a kind of robotic version of herself repeating sovereign citizen/maritime law/buy gold/the election was rigged/Trump is Godlike talking points. 

It’s killing my heart. Doubly so because I know it’s killing his and triplely (not a word) so because she’s allowing him to believe he and I are out of touch because I’m not stepping up (stepping up only has one definition in this case... agreeing with her about the SRA stuff).

His access to communication mediums is very limited and the only two ways I can think of to communicate with him directly are via Discord (but I don’t know his 4 digit code) or thru Minecraft. I haven’t done so yet because I’ve held out hope she’d come around and haven’t wanted to make it worse. It may be time though.

1273,Qdad thinks I’m going to die,"So I got my first dose of the vaccine three days ago and made the mistake of telling my Qdad after he said “no child of mine will be getting it”. I had naively hoped that by telling him, he might inch away from Q and anti vax once he saw I was still alive and ok. But nope.

I’ve been receiving messages and video links, him telling me the vaccine is a sham. The whistle blowers who are revealing the “truth” about the vaccine are mysteriously dying or committing suicide, “the list is endless” apparently. 

He sent me a video on Dolores Cahill who was claiming children and babies have been dying from mRNA vaccines, saying that the covid vaccine is going to kill people due to an immune response, the second dose will be wiping people out... when I sent him a screenshot others debunking her claims, unable to find proof of the research she’s talking about - his response was “of course the proof is hidden! You know the score by now” 

I’ve got an unopened video waiting for me, something about “as people have said all along, they never isolated the virus and if it’s not isolated you can’t create a vaccine” 


I’m just exhausted. I don’t want to donate any energy to debating him. Even if I sit quietly and nod, he talks endlessly, like he has a list of arguments in his head constantly that he just wants to rant about, to anyone that’ll listen. For the past few years I haven’t been challenging him, or arguing, simply nodding and letting him talk. A few months ago I started gently disagreeing and saying “well each to their own” and “everyone is entitled to their own opinion” when he went on a rant, he didn’t like this much and it seemed to fuel him on further. 

My head is scattered and I just feel done with it all. I want a normal day with my dad where he doesn’t bring any Q, anti vax, anti trans, “snowflakes”, “liberal tears”, covid is a hoax, biden isn’t the president, nonsense.",QAnonCasualties

1275,"Not sure what I'm doing at this point, I sound like a fool. I need help.","So happy to have found this Reddit. I want to start by saying I'm deeply saddened and sorry for those of you here that have gone through the worst. 

Reading these stories has given me insight into this situation and helps me realize I am not alone in all of this, and I have a resource to help me with my situation. 

I feel completely at a loss here and, unfortunately, losing all hope. I feel like I'm just surviving, and it's definitely taking a mental toll on my health and well-being. That being said, anyone in their right mind would make changes quick and better their situation. My therapist told me that my partner isn't crazy, but I am crazy for staying with her, damnnnnn. 

Note: I have two children. That I love and cherish with all my being, and they are my world. I've been married for almost 9 years. So this is fucking complicated. 

I guess I'll explain my situation the best I can.   


My partner(she) and I haven't had the best relationship over the years, but we have managed to be respectful and find common ground and shared interests. We definitely needed to work on our relationship before the pandemic. Still, like most people, we were busy with life and work and school and everything else that I suppose we figured we'll eventually get around to it. 

Then boom March 2020, the virus information starts spreading, and it all begins. She was an early adopter of the virus potentially being fake or a hoax. She spread information early on her FB that it was no worse than the common flu, people quickly tried to inform her she might be wrong, but she's hard to get through. She then really went deep and never turned back. 

She watched the documentary out of the shadows. And totally got wrapped up in all the conspiracies, the deep-state, far left evil pedo people. She watched the fall of the cabal.  She openly became a big social sharing advocate for all things conspiracy related. She's super ANTI-Masks, making fun of people that wear them, posting information that they are dangerous and bad for you. It's all part of the elite take over and controlling us and our rights. She voted for Bernie in the primaries but changed her stance and voted for Donald Trump in the recent election. She wanted so badly for the Qanon information to be true. She believed in a lot of the things and frequently discussed them with her groups of people. She canceled all her friends over disagreements or the fact that they didn't want to hang out without socially distancing or masked. She takes personal offense to it. (they don't want my germs) She canceled her church for disagreeing on certain political points. She thinks BLM is a Marxist movement and funded by George Soros. She shared an endless amount of misinformation on Instagram, always glued to her phone. Offensive stuff, a nonempathetic stance, which is hypocritical because she's a Christian. But it's all justified in this movement for evangelicals. She eventually deleted her IG because they're spying and stealing/listening to her and her information. She downloaded Parlar and Telegram, joined Anti Masks social groups and The Great Awakening. 

She thinks Biden and Kamala are EVIL. She believes Bill Gates is behind the virus and that the simulation event proves that. She believed in microchipping. She's super anti-vax and sends me an endless stream of information regarding the topic. She sends articles from bitchute, Gateway Pundit, Breitbart, and other far-right media outlets. She attended a conference with Judy Mikovitz and Peggy Hall in southern CA about masks and medical freedoms/general freedoms. She pushed the voting fraud information and didn't think Biden was going to get sworn in. She was always blaming things on ANTIFA, any violence, and anything that resulted from the LEFT and George Soros and Antifa, not the far-right/proud boys. She's for building the wall and stopping immigrants saying most children that come here are brought and sold into sex slavery by their own people.

She believes the Hillary/pizza gate/ Podesta stuff. 

Also, 5G is harmful, wanting to purchase EMF blocking things for the house, even clothing that blocks EMF. However, she's glued to her phone all day anyway. Covid Test's are fake. She believes in all the Robert F Kennedy stuff and the Children's health defense.  Chemtrails are real. Flat earth is possibly real, but she doesn't care. The total Coronavirus deaths are false and inaccurate, saying flu cases are down and every death is counted as a Covid death.   


On top of it all, she traveled out of state and attended a Church service during the pandemic where they were open and no masks required; she brought home Covid and gave it to herself, me, and our kids. I am still struggling with lung issues after having the virus since back in October 2020—all with no respect or regard to me in this process. Actually told her friend she didn't care if I was angry about it. 

She thinks that I am trying to control her and that I am mean to her. She thinks I am an enemy and that I need therapy to make our marriage work. She thinks that because we think differently I can't handle what she thinks, I am irrational and wrong. I am at a loss here. She indoctrinates our children with tons of this crazy stuff and thinks that if I speak to them otherwise, I am going against her. It's very one sided. And the worst part of it all she thinks all of this is important to share with others and feels in the know and woke and that she has to share this information with everyone. 

Now that Q has started falling apart, she claims she never believed in Q, and she's saying she believes it's a Psyop to get people to sit back and do nothing while our rights are being stripped away. 

There's more, and I could keep going, but I think yall get the point. 

Not sure what to do, how to get courage and move on. How to handle this with my kids. I'm just at a loss here. Sorry for the formatting of this long post. It became more of a quick word vomit of everything I can recall.

I don't know if I have the strength to forgive them for the insanity and drama.

What alarmed me the most wasn't supporting Trump (even though I despised him). I was never upset because they supported him, after all, we are all entitled to vote and support whoever we want. What really hurt me was them thinking that ""Liberals and leftists cabal"" who didn't support Trump would be rounded up publicly executed. Plus the days of darkness and emergency broadcast bullshit.

At first I felt relief and thought everything would go back to normal, but the more I think about it, the more I realize how dangerous these friends, relatives, neighbors, acquaintances co-workers really were.

You see, they aren't upset because they were fooled and made to look stupid, NO! THEY ARE UPSET BECAUSE ""LEFTISTS AND LIBERALS CABALS"" (just code for jew) weren't ""punished"". That's a very frightening thought! For the very first time in my life, I'm realizing what happened in Germany and Europe, is very possible in America.

What exactly is so appealing about:

* Executing political opponent
* Seizing America by force using the military (destruction of democracy)
* Installing an overlord or ""Fuhrer"" if you will.
* Total darkness and terror

My Q mom stopped contact with me after I “ruined Christmas” by not having an in person. Frantic texts the Covid “Hoax”, etc...

I guess I thought that the fact that neither of her children are speaking to her would be a wake up call, but it hasn’t been at all. If anything, she’s doubled down, more convinced than ever that she’s on the Lord’s side.

1279,"It's nice to know I'm no longer alone, I've struggled with the black hole of conspiracies almost my entire life","Tw: Mentions of self-harm, depression.

I'm so thankful that this community exists. I've had to deal with a father who has been so deep in conspiracies almost my entire life, that I never really formed a parent/child bond with him. He was deep into the Alex Jones mindset for years (all the way back to Y2K), and then when Q came along it got so much worse. At one point he had me on 23 different supplements that Alex Jones either sold or recommended. And since I was a teenager with limited internet access, I trusted what he gave me. I now have semi-permanent health issues from them. If you take these supplements from Alex Jones, STOP. They can and will affect your health negatively. Some of them have even tested positive for lead.

I'm thankful to be out of that house, and married with my own life, but it has never stopped. He calls me constantly or texts me what would amount to a short book. He has never stopped his barrage of conspiracy theories and his attempts at total control over the family. At one point I felt like the only way out was to end my life, that's how deeply he affected my mindset when I was a kid/teenager. I still have issues with depression because of it. I'm in therapy to work on the triggers he put there, but when I see his name pop up on my phone, it instantly ruins the rest of my day and sometimes week. I'm working to do better, for my future kids, but it's hard when he can suck me back into that black hole of thinking (that there is no way out from dealing with him) with the right words or phrases. I can't completely cut him out yet because I have younger siblings still underage that I need to stay in contact with to ensure their safety. 

I still feel pretty hopeless sometimes, but finding communities like this has been so helpful. I wish I could have found something like this when I was a kid/teenager.

1281,I Have Many Q-Casualties in my Life,"I am new here but I wanted to give a quick run down and rant about my experience.  I'm angry and frustrated.  I have a lot of people in my family and friends circle that are involved in Qanon.  Many of these are people that I love and respect. 

 I live in rural USA, Trump Country for sure.  My sister and many of my friends that I grew up with have gotten sucked into this to varying degrees.   Most of these people and I grew up in the same area.    I have limited my contact with a lot of them now though because it is impossible to have a civil conversation with them.  It's a lot of middle aged, bored women who want to feel like they are special and a part of something and most of them are harmless.  Annoying, but harmless.   I think the majority of these folks will not only fall away from this but deny they were ever anywhere close to it at all.  

There are some though that are really, pretty far gone and scary.

I have one friend who I am watching go further and further down this rabbit hole on social media.  She is getting more out of touch with reality by the day.  There are a 3 or 4 people in her online friend group who are really fueling this and they are flat deranged.   I am worried about her but I don't know what to say.

My Brother In Law is another one, but him I would expect.  He has always been weird and kind of violent.  He has physically hurt me before (but he didn't ""mean"" to hurt me of course).   I won't get into those details too much but he did permanent physical damage.  He is also verbally abusive every time I see him.  A bunch of chest thumping, hyper masculine bullshit.   He also thinks he is the (a?) mortal incarnation of a god (I'm not kidding).  I mean, clearly not firing on all four cylinders.  There is a zero contact rule for him in place already. 

My MIL is also involved in Q and she is the most hardcore and the most difficult.   The funny thing about her is that she is from southern California.  She is all crystals and light and meditation and supplements and just kind of a stereotypical [S.Cal](https://S.Cal) kooky nut.  But oh, the last four years she has gotten into some weird Nazi-mysticism meets Qanon stuff and it's wild.  I mean just really hateful, anti-semitic, white supremacy  stuff with alien bloodlines and woo-wooism thrown in to justify it all.  And a Trumper through and through.

  She is old enough that when she was in college she got sucked into McCarthyism in the 50's.  She speaks Russian because she thought it was important to ""Know the language of the enemy"" (for example).   She thinks there are people looking for her because of her alien bloodline and she is clearly, profoundly mentally ill and has been for a long time.   And it's very difficult to help her because any established medical or mental health professional is a ""medico"" and part of the conspiracy.  

She's always been paranoid and into conspiracy theories but holy crap, it got so it's hard to even have a conversation with her.  At all.  I haven't talked to her in months. 

It's always been hard to deal with her but now, there is just no reaching her or even having a civil conversation.  She has teetered on the brink of homelessness of years, largely because of her behavioral issues stemming from her mental illness.   She is not stupid and she's not a monster but she does seem consistently drawn to hateful ideologies.  

Which brings me to my final point I guess; it is hard for me to not make a personal judgement about these people.  To not see their attraction to this sort of conspiracy theory, cultism and ideology as a result of their profound character flaws, so much so that some of them are a danger to themselves and others.  I know that people talk about approaching them from a place of unconditional love, but....

I just don't have it in me right now.  I am angry and even disgusted. I know that says terrible things about my character but I'm just so tired of the hate and the abuse that they spew.",QAnonCasualties

1287,I don't know my Dad anymore.,"I doubt hardly anyone will notice this but I feel it's at least worth sharing my experience with people who share my same concerns and for others to notice the warning signs, but also to ask for advice. My Father was a birther during the Obama years. He believed that Obama was a part of the illuminati and a globalist who sought to destroy the United States. During the Trump years, however, this type of thinking only began to escalate. For the past several years, my Father has slowly but surely been sucked into the far-right internet rabbit hole. I myself, a former Trump supporter, now turned Democrat, have really noticed the transformation. It wasn't until this week, however, that I truly began to realize just how far my Father had bought into the QAnon lie. Honestly, I feel quite dumb for not putting the two and two together sooner. My Dad, a devote evangelical Christian, would watch ""news"" anchors such as Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity, believing every word spoken out of the mouths of these pathological liars. I bring up my Father being a devote Christian because  I think his beliefs do come from a place of sincere willingness to have faith and take people at their word.  However, when you don't question anything, that's when things become dangerous. When the pandemic began in March, he really began to get sucked into extremely far-right YouTube channels such as, Mark Dice and Steven Turley, as well as Facebook forums that pushed QAnon narratives such as the pandemic being a hoax. This in turn led to him not wearing a mask in public even though he is immunocompromised. Then came the lies that Bill Gates is a globalist who will use the vaccine to inject people with microchips and that the vaccine was made from aborted baby tissue. He began to refer to an upcoming vaccine as a ""mind control needle"". He still holds the steadfast belief that the vaccine will alter your biological DNA and brainwash you. (kind of the pot calling the kettle black) This is where I should've realized that my Father had become further radicalized but unfortunately when you hear for years that Obama is a Muslim born in Kenya and that chemtrails are real, nothing really surprises you. Things really began to ramp up toward the election, especially after Trump lost. He firmly believed so-called prophets on YouTube that Donald Trump was anointed by God to win a second term and even beyond. After Trump lost, of course, like most Trumpists, he believed whole heartedly that the election was stolen. He began listening to outlets and grifters online who only fed that lie. He began to believe them with every fiber of his being. He believed that God was allowing the election to be stolen only for Trump to reverse the results and assert himself as an omnipotent ruler and expose Democrats as satanic pedophiles, straight out of the crazy lala land QAnon textbook. When January 6th came along, he didn't seem distraught like my Mother and I, instead seemed more or less ok with what happened and almost as if the riot happened deservingly so. All of this leads me to today. My Father came out as a straight up QAnon believer, which even after everything caught me by surprise because I thought that maybe there was still some of the man I once knew left in him. I want to share my experience to tell anyone who my have a Trump supporter in their family or inner circle to keep an eye out for what they post online or say in-person. Look at the warning signs and reach out to talk to them before its too late and you lose them. I do want to pose the question to anyone still reading this who is maybe in a similar situation to me. I'm 18 and heading off to college in 4-6 months. How should I handle my relationship with my Dad after I leave home. I feel as though I don't have a Father anymore and he's been sucked into a scientology -type cult. I still love the man and part of the reason this has me so torn up is that I feel I may lose him for good. What would be anyone's recommendation with how I move forward. Do I completely cut him off? Do I try to get him help? Or is it even possible I could have a normal relationship with him anymore. It's almost as if he's a Klansman or Neo-Nazi. I really look forward to hearing from someone who maybe able to offer insight. If you came this far, thanks for reading and stay safe.",QAnonCasualties

1290,I had no idea there where so many others that lost a family member to Q. I felt so alone for so long.,Can hardly speak to my own mother anymore. She's hardly even the same person I always knew. It all happened so fast and for so long I barely saw it. Our relationship is beyond shattered. I just wanted her back ya know. Its like she's addicted to these fringe sites &amp; groups now that keep her going like this. Been looking for help for nearly 2 years now. I'm so in over my head. No amount of reason or logic or evidence is helping,QAnonCasualties
1291,My mom has turned to Q.,"Hi guys I just need to vent. I’m 21F in college living at home with both of my parents who have always been conservative. My mom was an army brat growing up but has never been super into politics. Although my mom voted for Trump twice and is a republican, she’s the sweetest lady you will ever meet. She’s always been my best friend. 

Anyways— In 2020 when Covid started, my mom became a huge conspiracy theorist. I didn’t think much of it at the time. She was just claiming that Covid was made in a lab and that they’re all lying about the numbers. She started watching FOX news every single night. My dad somewhat believes this stuff but not nearly to the extent that my mom does.

After the election when it was announced that Biden won, my mom dove deep into the Q rabbit hole. She started talking about the Insurrection Act and how trump was gonna use military to ‘take out the bad guys’. She started to stock up on food and was buying generators and lots of batteries. This went on from November all the way til Jan 20. She claims the pope has been arrested and that all these countries are having blackouts bc our military is in charge. She now believes our country is run by pedophiles and satanists. It really started to freak my dad and i out. 

She basically would talk about this stuff every single day up until Jan 20. She was so upset when Biden was inaugurated and trump didn’t show up with his military to take Biden out. But now she believes that on March 4th Trump will be inaugurated. I keep trying to tell my mom how stupid it is that the Q community finds a new date to obsess over and push the goalposts back. She won’t let up. All she does all day is go on her phone and watch these videos with headphones in. She barely interacts with us. I feel like she’s not even the same person.

My mom isn’t normally a fearful person. She was always an optimist growing up, and never let the little things get her down. She has a college degree and is a structural engineer. It makes me sad that someone so smart and educated believes political fan-fiction and things people write on forums. I’ve tried so hard to debate her, try and rationalize her, or get her to see that this is all nonsense but she won’t. Even my dad, who is also a trump supporter, admitted defeat that trump lost and that she needs to stop.

She’s completely brainwashed and there’s nothing I can do. I’ve tried everything. Of course I still love her unconditionally. She’s not a hateful person or violent person. She’s still a sweet person and has good intentions. I think that she was in a vulnerable state and Q took advantage of her when she was down. My mom is also super religious so I feel like that also has something to do with it. I’ve noticed a lot of similarities with Christianity and Q. All Q supporters believe that Q is like the messiah and will come to save them all and that ‘the storm’ is judgement day. 

I just had to vent. I know a lot of us are in situations like these where a loved one has been brainwashed by Q. It makes me really sad. I just hope one day she will wake up and see that this was all a waste of time. In the meantime, there’s nothing I can do. I can’t control what she does or what she believes. All I can do is love her unconditionally. She’s still my mom at the end of the day. I just wish I had my old mom back.

EDIT: forgot to mention that she believes that JFK Jr is still alive, that Mike Pompeo will be VP, and that Q is AI from the future. 😐",QAnonCasualties

1293,Need to vent and organize my thoughts,"Using a throwaway because family members use Reddit also

Iʼm really struggling after spending this past Saturday at my sisterʼs house and really getting into it with her and her husband. They have some really crazy, conspiracy-minded beliefs. They have not jumped completely down the rabbit hole, but it feels like itʼs only a matter of time now, and they buy into most of the ideas.

For example, they both believe:

*Masks donʼt really work and are just a distraction

*The new vaccine is dangerous

*No news or government sources can be trusted (i.e., the data on COVID-19 deaths is completely wrong and hospitals are misreporting deaths)

*All reported COVID-19 deaths were due to underlying causes, so fuck those people, they brought it on themselves. No young, healthy person has truly died from COVID

*COVID is no more dangerous than the flu (disproven, but news sources are “corrupt” and “have an agenda”) 

My BIL also brought up something something Bidenʼs son with the laptop and ties to Russia (disproven) and thinks somehow the fact that major credit card companies being in Delaware means something. Like why is Biden so wealthy (heʼs not) and oh he will die soon and Kamala Harris (the real danger) will take over. He listens to Joe Roganʼs podcast religiously and spews all kinds of nonsense. 

I may have more luck with my sister, but I am just so distraught and disappointed. I know she is smarter than this. But she also confessed that she really worries about my nephew growing up as a white male in our society. Women could accuse him of rape and ruin his life. Oh and Harvey Weinsteinʼs victims brought it on themselves too and arenʼt really victims. I realize that this is all coming from a place of fear and expressed to her that I worry she is vulnerable to extreme ways of thinking because she does not trust facts or science. 

Iʼm just so upset, but reading through the posts here helps me feel less alone and lost. My husband agrees with me but is tired of hearing about it and wants me to let it go. He has encouraged me to use the Socratic method as others have suggested to try to bring them back to reality. I told him I will try, but it is hard to want to maintain ties with people like this, even though they are family. I donʼt know how to teach them to care about other human beings lol

1295,"I got the vaccine a few days ago. It was fine, but the night before was scary.","My Qultist father trapped me in the kitchen and spent nearly two hours trying to convince me that it was Chinese biological warfare. The conversation had everything: Antifa, Black lives matter, Soros, you name it. The craziest part about it is how personally he took any rebuttals. Not surprising mind you, just very telling. I was “attacking [him]” first, more than attacking his conspiracy nonsense. At one point he even said he’d seen the conspiracies “with these two [eyes]” and made some appeal to his advanced age (65) as to mean he’s had plenty of time to witness his delusions, when he only ever gets his shit from facebook.

Anyway, He told me he was just trying to give me “other truth” because he “loves [me] so much that [he] could not in clear conscience let [me get the vaccine] without informing [me] of what they don’t tell you.” I don’t have a point here or anything, I’m just so tired. Days later and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m 21 but I can’t get out of the house because he still has most of my savings and shuffles it around to accounts I don’t even know where.

1297,Qultist father threatened my 17 year old sister,"My little sister (17) still lives at home with our dad, but I moved out in 2018. I just got a text from them saying that my father threatened them yesterday. He insisted that they come with him to our grandparents' house, but my sister refused to go since our grandmother doesn't actually want anyone visiting anyways since she's very at risk for COVID. He said something cryptic like ""remember this"" and my sister responded with ""what's the big fucking deal?"". I won't get into what he said but he essentially threatened them. They're staying with our mom now and they might stay with me for a bit too.

I'm just furious. My dad was an abuser when I lived at home, but he had gotten better and got professional help in recent years. But he joined the Qult over summer and he has gone so downhill. He only ever texts me about doomsday anymore and I usually just ignore it. But I can't ignore him threatening physical harm to my sister. I don't know what to say and I don't know if I have the heart to text him and essentially tell him I'm never talking to him again. I'm just so lost.

ETA: My sister doesn't want CPS involved. It would only over complicate things and last time CPS was involved they did nothing to help. I appreciate the suggestion but I won't be calling CPS.

ETA2: My father is a correctional lieutenant so I don't think cops are a great idea either

ETA3: My sister isn't currently in danger. They're with our mom and will probably come to my house. My dad dared them to call CPS because they don't really care where they end up. I don't think he'll take any legal action to get them back, but if he does my mom and I are ready.",QAnonCasualties

(Sorry for spelling/format, I fir4git my glasses and I'm on mobile.)

I reported my brother to his branch's CID/CIO/NCIS (again, can't give too much info just in case he's on Reddit), followed the instructions from one of the commenters. I submitted screenshots from the family group chat and all my concerns about him possibly sharing classified information plus not alerting anyone of the insurrection on Jan 6th. I didn't think anything else of it after that. 

This morning, though, I got a call from that department in his area, the officer O was following up on my report. I told him everything I knew, clarified some things, and gave more information. O stated that the report wasn't enough to get him in trouble, but that they would be looking further into it and possibly speaking to my brother regarding my concerns. I begged O to keep my name out of it and he said he'd only mention ""a concerned citizen"".

I hope this is the end of it. I hope that he hasn't done anything stupid enough to land him in trouble. I know he's not the same person I grew up knowing but he is still my brother. I may think he's an idiot, but he's my idiot, if that makes sense.",QAnonCasualties

1301,In a tricky situation,"Posting on a throwaway account more out of paranoia than anything.

For a brief bit of context, my dad has always been a piece of work. He's always presented himself as this ultra-moral devout Christian in public, but behind closed doors he was physically and mentally abusive to me and my siblings when we were growing up. My mum, on the other hand, isn't. She's always been as kind and loving as you'd expect a mother to be. As far as I'm aware his abuse never extended to violence against her.

I left home at 17, my younger brother followed not long after. That was in the year 2000 and I've been no contact with him ever since. I have, however, been in semi-regular contact with mum on the downlow through the years.

Now, I have teenage children of my own who have never met their grandparents (well, they've spent plenty of time with my in-laws but you know what I mean). Both my parents have tried to get in contact with me/my wife and more recently my kids as they discovered social media.

How is this relevant, you may ask? Well recently, after a lot of prodding by my wife, I got ""officially"" back in contact with my mum on facebook, and we had a nice catchup. Thing is, I also had a bit of a peruse of the stuff my dad posts on there and he is **FULL ON Q** at this point. We're talking all the stuff about adrenochrome and the storm and everything. My cynical side is absolutely not surprised by this at all. However, I am worried about my mother.

I don't think she's going the same way, but I get the feeling her reaching out to me is some sort of cry for help. All my siblings have moved on and now she's stuck at home with him (she has never worked and he is currently furloughed due to the pandemic). I've been steadfast that I'm totally happy for her to come and visit, but that I would not let that man in my house or allow him to be around my kids, but the pair of them kind of come as a package deal.

1302,I don't know what to do...,"Yesterday I had another huge blow up with my parents, I couldn't carry on hearing my mom talking about how they're building detention centres in Germany for people who refuse to take the vaccine (I'm from the UK).

I questioned my mother's sources which led me to find the source in question as on YouTube ""Luigi Baratiri"" who runs some bullshit blogs about the pLaNdEmIc. Which led me to a video, where he cited an NPR article about political activism in CLUB PENGUIN as some sort of evidence for political manipulation. (I really wish I was fucking joking right now, see the article below)

I berated her, I could take hearing about the secret covid police or a fake election anymore. My dad didn't take very kindly to my outburst, ""You just always have to be right don't you?""

I know arguing with an idiot makes you the bigger idiot, but there was no fucking way that I was going to back down from this.

Long story short, I left home with no plan. I almost contemplated taking the car and just going (I don't have a license)

I left with a toothbrush, an extra t shirt and my laptop since I still have to work. One of my boys was kind enough to let me stay over at his and continue with my work, but the last thing I want to do is overstay my welcome.

I have to go back today, my laptop has barely any battery left and I forgot my laptop charger since I left in a rush thinking id packed it. I need to move out (I'm 20) but I can't immediately without setting myself back financially for a few years, and if it goes to shit I don't even know if I'd be able to move back in (not that I'd even dream of going back once I've left) and my little brother still isn't old enough for me to become his legal guardian until the end of the year, and they've been spewing their bullshit into his ear about the microchips and the Clintons being demon vampires that eat children (fortunately for me, my brother is intelligent and wants to hear none of it like me)

What the fuck do I do? I wasn't planning on moving out until November since I thought it would blow over or that I'd be able to handle not calling out their bullshit for that long (it's been 3 months since I last argued with them about rona/vaccine/politics)

My parents are in a state of mental instability and one wrong move from me could mean some potentially uncorrectable predicament. They are beyond saving from this bullshit but I still need them as my crutch to not screw my self over even worse than I already am now.

Any ideas on ways to approach this would be much appreciated. My current plan is to hold out for a little longer and move out in the summer so I have enough money to cover me in the case of an emergency until my. Mates flat contract is up so I can get a roomie and not declare bankruptcy by the age of 21

1303,Like this never happened.. -vent,"Hello.. My partner is/was a Q follower for the last year and a half. Now, he is acting like it hasn't been an issue or interference in our relationship. 

It was to the point where, almost, everything out of his mouth was Q related. Tried multiple times to speak to him about how I felt while he was in the thick of it, but it always ended up in arguments. Thus, I put my foot down and tried a ""no politics"" thing. We stopped speaking, basically.

On the 20th, he was so worried about Chinese boots hitting our soil (still is) so much so that he was just going to leave. He kind of did. He went to the mountains in the AM, did whatever, then checked how things were.. Saw nothing happened and came home. 

NOW, he is calling Q an ""exercise of discernment."" That he will not be voting and, eventually, wants to just opt out of society all together. He is focusing on ""saving money to get a bus to move to his land.""

This is the kicker for me:
I have been going to therapy to try to help my communication skills to discuss things, so we can move on..
HE is asking ME not to bring up Q or the political issues to him BECAUSE OF MY POLITICAL BOUNDARY. I am sorry, but doesn't that seem...??? 
We have had this thing come between us.
You obsessed over it. I obsessed over learning about it to keep up with you.. We cannot act like this didn't happen. 
Then to throw in the boundary YOU NEVER RESPECTED? What? Wut? Wat?

Also, I hated saying that this whole thing radicalized me, but it fully did. I cannot even think to say that to him.

1305,I’m about to go to therapy after being kicked out of the house my Qmember family.,"Honestly, I don’t even know how to go about this. My fiancé and I lived with my mom and my stepdad during the pandemic in order to save up for our wedding in July. When we got engaged in June my family was over the moon excited and we made plans to have everyone come to the wedding.

Fast forward six months later and we’ve been kicked out of the house because we do not believe in the conspiracy theories and the absolute lies they keep feeding us. I have been told multiple times that I am destroying the country because of my support for the Black Lives Matter movement and that we apparently hate everything my parents stand for. 

My family has a history of emotional abuse but after being away from college for so long I thought everything would be fine if we lived there for a year. Now my family has told me that they have been “trying to be happy for me” when it comes to the wedding but they just can’t because my fiancé had interrupted my step-dad the night before our engagement party because they had started getting heated about politics and they were making one of my bridesmaids completely uncomfortable. 

I have dropped contact with my family and my mom keeps sending me videos, articles and think-pieces about cognitive dissonance because I don’t believe Trump will be President again and the 6 days of darkness that was supposed to happen after the inauguration. My uncle also participated in the insurrection and stormed the outside of the Capitol building and was shocked that the police dared to use tear gas on them.

Anyways, I am now going to my first therapy appointment to deal with this and I have no idea how to talk to my therapist without sounding like I’m completely crazy.

1307,Got a phone call from my aunt yesterday and it's worse than I thought.,"It was my birthday, and that day I tend to receive a lot of phone calls. That days made no exception. An aunt and a cousin from my mom's side called me (I have 2 aunts and 1 uncle on this side. This cousin, a nurse, born two days before me, wasn't their child. So it was surprising to hear her on the phone as this aunt and cousin do not usually live close from each other).

What was meant to be a rather short call turned into a very emotional two hour long call as they asked about my life and how things are going. My mom came up.

As some people might already know, my mom is Q and has been sharing her insanity to the rest of the family and colleagues. She spends 5 hours a day doing ""research"", sending out emails and calling people to talk about her theories, so my aunt and her partners and cousin were painfully aware of her views, often going on inane rants for hours on the phone (my mom called my aunt earlier that same day, which went onto a 3 hour rant about the Chinese army entering Canada to spread covid and soon invade the US).

During this interesting phone call, I learned that this aunt and side of the family is sane, but I also learned that my religious aunt, the mother of the cousin who was on the phone, and my 86 years old grandpa, which is the sweetest old man you can imagine, have fell for my mom's theories.

Like clockwork, my mom would call my grandpa every day, and he would listen to her for hours. He doesn't know much how to use a computer, is very impressionable. On top of that, he see my mom as very smart and knowledgeable, and similar to my late grandma, so he tends to adhere to everything she says. And now he is very scared.
Because of his age, grandpa is very susceptible to covid too, but my mom is anti-vaxx, and my grandpa has a girlfriend whom openly stated that she wanted him vaccinated. My mom being very confrontational,  I fear the worse soon.

1308,First time poster. Born and Raised in a Cult. I'd like to give you some resources.,"I thought this would be a good place for me to post this since I’ve seen many many people worried about their parents and loved ones displaying cultic behavior. Feel free to share in other spaces if allowed and with others that may benefit from it. 

I was born &amp; raised in a cult. Biggest differences between being born &amp; raise and joining is that, I desperately wanted out so I’m not as familiar with getting family members out of a cult. Since I have the resources, I spoke to an exit counselor that has been doing this for over 30 years now and here’s what he had to say. 

Exit Counseling

* Talking someone out of a cult is highly individual, takes a very long time and a good amount of research. A few good questions to ask yourself are:
    What is the relationship of your parent (family member) to the ideology?
    What speaks specifically to them?
    Who would be the best person to reach them? Is it me? Or is it my sibling or an aunt? Uncle? Who are they more likely to listen to? It’s important to take the time to figure out what about this ideology is resonating with them? Do your research before you approach them.

* When would be the best time to speak with them? He explained: Do not try to change their mind now or just after the inauguration. Wait until about February or March. As he said to me “you don’t try to talk someone out of catholicism 2 weeks before Christmas”. 

* When speaking with them now, know that: antagonizing them, sending them articles proving their ideology wrong, calling them dumb or crazy or stupid is the worst thing you can do. It only drives them further into the ideology as they dig their heels in. The idea is to find a commonality. Finding safe topics to speak on and keeping the relationship open so that they can feel safe speaking to you once the ideology starts cracking and they start having doubts. You want to be their go to person on the outside where they can express their doubts and concerns safely as it’s downright dangerous to do this within the cult. 

* Understanding where they come from. I know how this sounds and this is the hardest part and the reason why you need to ask yourself, are you the person for this job? Or will it be your aunt or your little sister or someone else. Because you’re going to need to ask them for the information on what they believe in. You’ll need to read it and listen to them explain it. You’ll need to know. 

That doesn’t mean you agree with it. Understanding and agreement are two very separate things. A lot of it will be hard to read or hear but asking questions so you “can understand better” will establish that you’re struggling to understand their ideology. Criticisms of the ideology are more likely to be listened to if you ask questions first and make an effort to understand their side. Creating permission to criticize a subject is important. The example he gave was, if someone comes into your house and says a particular painting is ugly, you’re not likely to listen to it. But if someone asks, what do you think the idea behind the use of that orange in the painting was? It indicates engagement and interest and criticism will be more likely to be accepted. 

* What you’re trying to do here is to provide a path out. It’s planting the seeds. It’s not going to happen from one day to the next. 

How to protect yourself while trying to help. 

* Stay within safe subjects if possible.
Have an excuse to leave built into the discussion. “I have a meeting at x time. I’m waiting for a phone call from a friend”. This way, if things go south, you have an out and can take care of yourself.

* If they give you info, tell them that you’re still processing it and that you don’t want to be reactionary. “You deserve my best, and I can’t seem to have the focus for that right now, I’d rather do that when I’m in a good space”. All of this still indicates effort while keeping the lines of communication open. 

* Examine your own prejudices as they will be used against you. “The left is about tolerance, wHy ARen’T yOu tOleRanT???” We’ve seen that plenty of times, haven’t we? Be prepared to have your own bias questioned. 


It is keeping the lines of communication open. The most important thing to remember is that your parent or family member isn’t doing this to hurt you. **THEY’RE DOING IT TO SAVE YOU**. As a person who was born &amp; raised and has met many people that have either joined or were born &amp; raised as well, I can promise you that all cults are all here TO SAVE YOU. They have the truth. They’re here to save humanity, the country, the world. It is a bigger purpose than their own individual and this is mostly what attracts people in. In the words of Deborah Layton (Jonestown survivor) ""Nobody joins a cult"". From what I gather, you join a movement, an ideology, a yoga class... you take a personality test. This has been building for years. We didn't just get here out of nowhere. 

One last thing, the counselor said something interesting. At times, people are too embarrassed to say they don’t believe in it anymore.

1310,Anyone have constructive advice or experience with reporting Q videos or materials?,"My 76-yo QMom has been going down the rabbit hole for a while now. At first it was kind of funny but now I’m actually a bit freaked out. This morning she emailed a link to a Q video which I will not be watching, but it is hashtagged #qanon, #trump, and #pizzagate, so I can only imagine the gems within. 

These emails and texts give me the shakes. I think it’s mostly because I feel completely powerless and I’m concerned about her mental health, as I’m sure everyone in the group is about their Q person/people. I can’t believe things have gone this far. 

Has anyone tried calling law enforcement for a welfare check on their Q person?
Is there a way to report these videos? It was on an independent website called bitchute.com. 
Besides cutting off contact (not an option at this point), I’m open to constructive ideas.

Thanks, friends.",QAnonCasualties

1315,QAnon Ruining My Sister’s Life (Black QAnon??!),"My older sister and I have always been close. We are two years apart and at one point I considered her one of my best friends. Before I go too deep into this, we are Black American, both went to the same historically black university (HBCU) and were raised to love ourselves and be proud of who we are.

My sister started diving into conspiracy theories around 2015. Her son had gotten an MMR shot at a year old and she was convinced that it had slowed his progress. It was a bone of contention between her and her husband because he did not agree, but they decided to stop vaccinating. I have two children around the same age so she began sending me at least 10 articles daily about not vaccinating. We had very heated arguments on the topic, but we resolved that she’ll do her thing and I’ll do mine.

Then, in 2016 things got really crazy. She began openly supporting Trump. I chalked it up to her owning a business. Her husband and our family left it as another thing we just won’t talk to her about. But she wouldn’t let it go. We live in a mostly Black suburb in a very blue state, and a Black woman wearing “MAGA” and “Deplorable” gear did not rock with, well, anyone. Her husband, who is also Black, stopped taking her places. Friends stopped wanting to meet up with her. She came to a family reunion in a MAGA hat and it turned into chaos so quickly that she was asked to leave and never come to a family function until she “gets her mind right.” 

Every convo somehow made its way back to Trump. Before 2015, we talked all day, every single day. By the 2016 election we spoke maybe once every two weeks, mostly because I avoided her calls. She sent me articles and videos, and I put our convos on mute. Her husband revealed to mine that their marriage was on thin ice but he was trying to make it work.

Lots of things happened between then and 2020. We’re from Charlottesville, VA and everyone we knew agreed that what happened in 2017 was vile. But my sister said those were patriots fighting for their legacy. Yeah, okay girl. Then the whole “shithole country” nonsense... my husband is Nigerian-American and she called his country a shithole to his face. After that, we only spoke about the kids. 

Then the pandemic happened. Our parents are up in age so I only see them to drop off groceries and talk through the screen door. My sister, to this day, believes COVID is a hoax to take down Donald Trump. She does not mask. She has been banned from several places because she argues with staff in stores. Again, where we live does not play that. I saw her leaving our parents’ house once with a Q shirt. We argued because she was inside without a mask, until our dad came outside and told us to stop it. Two weeks later, both of our parents got COVID and have been very sick ever since.

This post is getting quite long but the cherry on top was the murder of George Floyd. While practically everyone we know across racial lines spoke out on the horror of his death, she made it a point to call out his past. She called BLM a terrorist organization. She said Black people are sheep and if we weren’t criminals we wouldn’t be victims of gun violence. Some of the things she said could have very well been written by the KKK. This was the tipping point. People boycotted her business en masse (which was already in jeopardy due to the pandemic). Her husband finally filed for divorce and moved out. He motioned for full custody of their two sons.

I love my sister but I do not understand how she can even begin to reconcile these beliefs with her very identity. It’s one thing to have contrary beliefs. It’s another to sacrifice who you are, who your children are, for these beliefs. I’ve begrudgingly read some of her facebook or IG posts and am disgusted. Her “Q family” hops into the comments saying horribly racist, anti-Semitic, vile things...but they’re in line with what she says! QAnon hasn’t only fractured our family, her family, but it’s also fractured her relationship with her community, her history. I know that disengaging with her as our beliefs began to diverge is why she turned to Q in the first place. Still, I will just never understand.

Obviously all views are welcome, but does anyone have experience POC or Jewish Q family/friends?",QAnonCasualties
1316,My daughter is leaving me slowly for Q. Help.,"I’m just discovering my oldest daughter has grasp onto the Qanon beliefs after months of unexplained behavior and treatment and withholding my grand babies from visiting.  She has always been easily influenced and her teenage years and young adult years were filled with pulling her away from gangs and bad relationships.  She met what  wonderful young man who adores her and they have been married for 7 years and she is now 38 yrs old as is he  They are both college educated with finance degrees and make very good money. But they are naive. I am very liberal and always have been and she was raised with openness and acceptance. I am half Hispanic and she is 3/4 with her dad being Hispanic, yet she looks white because of all the mixture in our family history.  I’m only mentioning this because I was a single parent most of her life and she has seen first hand racism against me and also her siblings who look Hispanic.  In the last 6-7 months she has began a change byway of not trusting me and withholding the grand babies from me for no reason or without excuse or because she felt like I was telling them “secrets,” giving them too much sweets and making them sick on purpose, or telling them ”things” she didn’t believe in.  I’ve been so confused and finally told her to kiss my ass and I was done with trying to fix something I don’t know I broke.  Then it started coming out.  She first told me that i had said some horrible things about the Proud boys and they are just patriots and are not a white supremist group and the leader was Hispanic.  I corrected her and told her that’s nonsense and to please look it up.  Then the next bombshell, I got my Biden sticker and then...she was voting for Trump and Biden and Harris were horrible people and scary and evil.  I was shaking my head and asked her if that’s why the kids can’t come over. No response. Then today...I was watching a show about Qanon and recognized some “phrases” that she has said to me about my behavior in the Qanon thought process so I asked her.  She confirmed and told me the kids aren’t coming because I have a BLM poster in my window and I must approve of burning bibles and destroying this country and silencing Christianity.  she said she will agree to disagree but doesn’t want me talking to her ch8kdren about my beliefs.  I assured her me and my 5 and 4 yo grand babies don’t talk politics.  I’m just floored.  And I’m also frightened for her and my grand babies.  Wth do I do?  How do I continue knowing this?  I’m frightened that if she can go from my best friend and daughter and MemAw to my precious babies, to an enemy who may harm my babies with evil information.  WTF?  I don’t know what to do.  Me and her siblings are dumbfounded.  We have seen the change and some of it is just her, she’s spoiled, the firstborn and self centered but never hateful.  she won’t even call her siblings And thinks some shitty things about them. I don’t know what to do.  I’ve been crying a lot over the last months but now it’s mixed with fear.  She’s also a COVID denier and they did all get COVID and have went on vacations several times.  I’m high risk So once I found out they were traveling, I stopped contact and didn’t see the kids for 3 mths.  I was punished for this also.  as a mom, I don’t know how to get her out of this.  Her husband is just as naive.  I’m just so sad.",QAnonCasualties
1317,QAnons completely missed the point of going down the rabbit hole.,"I went down the rabbit hole years ago. Every conspiracy I could get my hands on, I dug in and read about it. 

You know what the big take away for me was that I don't think Q's can seem to get to? 

You are supposed to go *through* the rabbit hole, and come out the other side, because the rest doesn't amount to a hill of beans. 

I mean what does it all come down to? Let's say all of the craziest conspiracy shit is totally true, just what in the hell are *you* going to do about it? 

***The only thing in this life that you can change is whether or not you are nice to others.*** 

That's the point of going down the rabbit hole. Sure, some of it may be true, most of it outlandish, but the only real control you have is how you treat others, in the end. 

I guess that's the saddest part of QAnon casualties, the irony of the negative impact these people end up having on the themselves and others.

1319,I miss my Mom and I'd like some advice re: mental health and therapy,"This is my first post here and when I was referred to this group. I was skeptical at first if I truly belonged because while Mom really fell into believing conspiracies through reading retired military texts, watching Dan Bongino, reading more and more extreme-right leaning sites, getting rid of cable, and instead as a retired, single person, consuming hours of Youtube. She claims she doesn't know what Q is but has obviously wandered down several rabbit holes which has led to mental and emotional deterioration noticed not only by me but friends and other family members, even the conservative ones who have always been conservative but they see her struggling and are concerned.

I joined this group shortly after it got really bad, but the day of the House impeachment hearing, she kept texting me all kinds of things that made it seem as though the world was going to grind to a startling halt at any moment. It wasn't the typical pedophelia/Pizza Gate or blood ritual things that one often thinks of as traditionally ""Q"" but more about the Pope being arrested, mass blackouts &amp; internet troubles happening world wide, our news not telling us what is really happening, our ballots being sent overseas to be counted after the election,etc. I have told her in the past, and continue to do so, that I can't talk about political things with her because I can't live in that constant space of fear nor can I tolerate my algorithms being changed by the links she sends me. The other reason I give is that I have had a lot of financial identity concerns lately with everything being so digitial and really want to try to stick to only my trusted sites. That strategy worked for a while but she was paranoid and so frightened that day, and I was in a work setting without the time or mental space to help her out of her lonely, angry space. It was so mentally and emotially wrenching and took me a few weeks to recover from even with a support network of amazing family and friends around me.

Come to find out, she decided to wean herself off of some of her meds without consulting her doctor and has constantly insisted she is ""fine"" but has struggled with clinical depression, anxiety, trauma, and legal substance abuse on and off throughout her entire life. Reading the books recommended by this group (particulary Steven Hassan/studying on what happens when the brain's amygdala is triggered) has helped me heal and process some of the defensive things she has been saying quite a bit and taking some time off has helped as well. Today we spoke and she seemed much better now that she is taking her meds again. She still is fearful of what is ""going down"" in our government but no where near what she was battling a couple weeks ago. I don't know if that's because of a combination of the meds working and some of the conspiracy forums and sites being taken down but I feel such relief at having some piece of her back at least for now. The advice here to continue a conversation and let her know she is loved has been vital but it has been so tricky. As an only child, single-parent, 30 something person, I don't want to lose her.

Maybe this has been discussed before and I hope not to annoy anyone by re-asking but have any of you experienced a past pattern of mental illness in your Q person before they fell into this that has re-ignighted some of their past trauma/triggers? Has anyone helped anyone out of that or could anyone recommend some good books? Also, I have seen resources for getting counselling but is there a specific specialty I should look up in a counsellor when seeking some help with this? Mom doesn't believe in therapy but I do. I generally have done better with self-help with my own mental/emotional issues but think this is a bit beyond me to pull out of myself.

Finally, I want to say that I really appreciate all this forum has brought forth and given to so many who, like me, are really struggling with watching their loved ones go through something like this. Sending out positivity, healing, and strength for all of you who have come here seeking some comfort and support.",QAnonCasualties

1322,"Spiritual Person Struggling Spiritually due to QAnon/""Conspirituality"" - Anyone else?","Any other spiritual people here? I'm a spiritual person/reiki practitioner of a few years now but in the past few months I've started to question EVERYTHING due to QAnon. 

I'll give you the cliff notes version of how this happened. A very close friend (lets call them ""J"") went through a spiritual awakening last year and we got closer because of it. J started following some ""spiritual influencers"" and started getting into some dark conspiracy theories because of them (""Trump is a lightworker and here to save us all"", Child sex trafficking #savethechildren). To be clear, these influencers never blatantly say they're a part of Qanon or even say they're Trump supporters. To be honest, I'm not even sure if the influencers know they're spewing Qanon beliefs. Also, J is someone that was always liberal and still technically is but they refused to vote in the election (due to ""not wanting to be a part of the negativity"" and also believing Trump was going to win anyway). They also refuse to wear masks and said they'd refuse the vaccine once it's available. To top it all off, J refuses to believe the things she believes are Qanon beliefs. 

We hardly speak anymore and our friendship is on the brink of ending. It's recently come to my attention that this really isn't an isolated incident and more prevalent than I thought. Here are some op-ed pieces about all of this if you're not familiar:

I hate to admit this but this situation has entirely shaken my belief system and I've been really struggling for the past few months. Part of me feels so betrayed that I don't want anything to do with this community. Another part of me feels gaslit and makes me question if I'm the one that's wrong about all this stuff going on. 

Just curious if anyone is dealing with something similar and is struggling spiritually as well. To be honest, it'd be just nice to know I'm not going through this alone. Any advice about how to come back to my spirituality would be great as well.

1324,QAnon just seems like another chapter in the never ending Satanic Panic:(,"Does anyone else remember the Satanic Panic in the 80s and 90s? I remember growing up with an evangelical mother, who went a little crazy, getting enraged over silly things like rock music, and thinking that Satanists were sacrificing children...and when the rapture didn't happen, she cooled down for a few years, focusing more on being racist, homophobic, and xenophobic, which wasn't any better (I'm biracial,  so it was a complete nightmare for me )... When Obama was running for president, my mother had just started going to a new church. One day she came home basically convinced that Obama was the antichrist, but she wouldn't discuss it. She seemed almost afraid to disclose these ""truths"". She started getting into bizarre conspiracy theories, denying anything science based, and getting progressively more and more hateful, irrational, and delusional. She began to believe that she possessed magical healing powers, and insisted on ""laying hands"" and speaking in tongues. I went no contact when she frightened my child. I thought that maybe she would realize she needed help if her behavior caused her to not be able to see her only grandchild.
I haven't spoke to her in about 8 years. So, while it was no surprise that she was a Trump supporter, I was shocked at just how bad she's gotten. She sent me a long message about a week before the Capitol attack, and it was a warning about things to come, claiming she had been awakened to the truth, hailing Trump as a savior for the people, and giving a vague warning about January 6th. She indicated that she had stopped paying her bills and quit her job, believing that some grand conjunction would bring about a release of hidden life-saving technologies, complete debt forgiveness, and something that sounded like Universal Basic Income.(I know, it sounds like someone ripped off plot points from The Dark Crystal, Black Panther, and Fight Club.)

When calling lawyers about my emergency custody case I had this terror that none of them would understand QAnon. 

I had to ask them if they've heard about QAnon...this was back in November 2020. Some only recently or 6 months before had heard it mentioned. Mean while here I am with a spouse (legally separated from, but could still see our son a few hours a week per a custody agreement) that was deep into it and all the cryptic emails, texts and conversations and then notes he wrote to me and then riped up because his devices were ""hacked""... were ramping up to what I felt dangerous levels for myself and our toddler.  

Did anyone early on feel like they weren't believe by the legal system...lawyers, judges, law enforcement?

1337,My father's head-canon has won the war against his ability to think rationally.,"Okay, brief background: we're Canadian. He grew up a poor farmer whose family had to do everything from shoot every small critter they could (squirrels/foxes/rabbits/martin/etc) to sell their hides up to hiding evidence from the game warden that big game like moose suddenly disappeared because in those days people like them would STARVE and never would let something so rare (in those days) go by. He grew up to be my far-right leaning, narcissistic father whose emotional and mental abuse have distanced me from him but sadly NOT on a physical scale despite repeated attempts to escape him.

Fast-forward to the present:

This latest bit of news with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apparently making new arrivals into the country quarantine in these overpriced motels instead of their own home residences got him on the warpath this morning as he was watching a video that media outlet Rebel News made on it.

So, these motels have security detail, provided by Paladin....I don't know what their full company name is. It could just be plainly Paladin Security. Anywhoooooo.....he was explaining to me that about 10 or so some odd years ago, there was some kind of home contractor outfit that strolled into town named Paladin, as well. But, of course, heaven forbid that he be able to tell me if that was the FULL name or if it's just the short-hand version of their name.

Whatever they were, these people had pulled the big con over most of the big businesses (and some smaller ones) in town and that TECHNICALLY they (Paladin) were now the owners of these units that they had convinced all these business to invest anywhere from five to six-digit figures of their own funds to build these homes that they promptly sold for figures ranging from $400K to just under $700K apiece. They banded together to get a lawyer to try to recoup at least some of their losses but they wound up high and dry because of the way the con was set up. Airtight case and that these places were ""worked over by professional con artists"".

So what does a security guard dispatchment and some crooked home contractors have to do with one another? Yeah, I don't know either!

He REFUSED to acknowledge the fact that multiple industries can have the same fucking word within their respective company's names. This is what irks me the most. Even the most basic online searches with the word Paladin for home contractors comes up with a stupid amount of different results, all completely independent from one another (mostly based in the U.S. but still....).

As a side effect of him trying to tie these two things together, it has the unfortunate result of not only causing initial grief but also a way to find yet another excuse to inject his Trump-indoctrinated beliefs by saying, as an aside, things such as ""Trudeau's so useless, if this was the States, Trump would have solved all these problems"".

I already hate my father for the innumerous amount of offences he has against me and having to watch as he poisons my mother's mind in her last couple years left in this world (small-cell cancer, literally can't be beaten, only delayed) has me finally wishing I had zero conscience to speak of and just kill him point-blank with his own shotgun shoved in his mouth as I wake him up from bed to make sure he sees it's me who kills him.

Unfortunately, the fear of consequences leaves me with little choice but to vent my frustrations and even my oldest sister agrees he's out to town on his FOX and Trump-fuelled arrogance but she's more concerned (and rightfully so) with taking care of her family and trying not to make everything implode. I'm the impulsive youngest child who is forced to live with this day-to-day and it's becoming too much to bear. Our middle sister likes Trump but isn't politically involved so she's actually even-handed on everything and we've agreed to never discuss such matters to keep things civil.

I don't even like politics but the way my father HAS to find a way to worm it into everything and distort reality to feed his ego and personal bias while pretending he knows EVERYTHING from medicine to engineering to anything else that impacts the world at large while being nothing but a high school dropout who fell trees as a logger for 30-some years before semi-retiring because he's ALWAYS been a farmer...I acknowledge I have unhealthy bias against wilful ignorance and blatant stupidity but this is on a level that I hope I can see the day he's buried so I can desecrate his tombstone by pulling down my pants and shitting all over it and I couldn't give a fucking damn who sees it.",QAnonCasualties

My dad is more extreme. Both my parents believe that the election was stolen, but my dad is much angrier about it. He only trusts Fox News, and I’m not sure if he still trusts them or thinks they’re influenced too much by liberals. On some days, he’ll spend hours listening to political YouTube. 

After he found out that I came out, it seems like he might be getting worse. He talks about how liberals want to destroy the nuclear family and I’m pretty sure he thinks that antifa was behind storming the capitol (not 100% sure about the last part). We haven’t had a proper conversation about it and I’m pretty nervous.

My aunt worships Trump. She bought that one trump coin. She has a picture of Trump hanging up in her house. She has a cardboard cutout of Trump in her room. She completely idolizes Trump and loves to talk about him. My aunt also has told me that homosexuality is a metal illness. I’m not absolutely sure what all her beliefs are, but she’s farther right than my dad.

1341,Mom on the cusp of becoming Q?,"A little backstory: my mom was a Democrat up until 2008. She and my grandmother supported Clinton in the primary that year, but when Obama won the nomination, they both went hard right overnight because they believed the lies that he was a “socialist”. They voted McCain in 2008, Romney in 2012, and Trump in 2016.

Thankfully, my grandmother came to see Trump for who he was, saying she would “never vote for that racist, sexist, bigoted man again”, and sure enough she proudly (in part as a Catholic, in part because she loves Kamala Harris) cast her vote for Biden. My mom, on the other hand, has dug in harder. I have wavered on whether I should post in this group because she has not yet gone full-on Q, but more and more of what she says is starting to scare me.

I figure it’s best now to try to nip it in the bud before things get worse. I recently deleted almost all my social media (excepting YouTube and Reddit) for my own sanity, and encouraged my mom to do the same in an attempt to extricate her from the dangerous conspiracy theories she was being fed by the algorithms. However, the timing was bad: it was right around the time many people were leaving Facebook for Parler. Now I fear that the saying “be careful what you wish for” is coming true—she’s deleted her Facebook and Twitter accounts, but had a Parler account and now uses Signal and Telegram to partake in Trumpist groups, some of which have Q supporters.

This became very apparent about a week before Biden’s inauguration, when my mom sent my grandmother and me a video from a pastor warning that Trump would declare martial law in a few days‘ time until Q’s “plan” had been executed, encouraging people to take all their money out of the bank and stock up on food in the meantime. My poor grandmother walked to her credit union as she cannot drive and took out several hundred dollars in fear; needless to say, she was mad when “the plan” didn’t come to fruition.

That was part of the impetus for the argument they got into when my mom took my grandmother grocery shopping one day, culminating in my mom yelling that my grandmother and I were “socialists” and “traitors” for *daring* to not vote for Trump. Granted, I only found out that I had been called these names when my grandmother called me crying after the fight. The same night, I received yet another video from my mom asserting that Trump was going to let Biden’s inauguration start like normal, this way every Democratic lawmaker would be in one place to be summarily ”brought to justice”, followed by Trump getting sworn in for a second term.

We haven’t really talked much about politics since the inauguration, and I’m not sure if that’s a good thing. On the one hand, I’ve been far less stressed out, and we’ve actually had conversations in person that went very well—clearly we’re not at the point of estrangement. However, I fear what “information” she’s taking in without me to repudiate it; I encourage her to fact check what she reads, but she doesn’t trust mainstream media, and while I know such outlets are not perfect, at least they strive for accuracy and truthfulness. I just don’t know whether I can be optimistic and let my guard down, or if I‘m going to need to be vigilant for the foreseeable future. It’s just so exhausting, y’all.",QAnonCasualties

1354,Ruining my parents' 35 year marriage,"I never thought I'd be posting here, but I need to vent and am seeing other similar stories so here we go: 

So let me start by saying my parents have always been madly in love with each other. When I was younger, sometimes disgustingly so. When all of my friends' parents were getting divorced, I always thought how lucky I was to have such loving parents. They've been married for 35 years, had 3 kids, and now have grandkids. Since they have both retired, I thought they might get sick of each other, but no. It was like a second honeymoon phase. And I loved them for it. 

Fast forward to the start of the pandemic. My mom is addicted to Facebook and when the pandemic started, I could tell she was on it obsessively. Slowly I started to notice changes in her thought process, saying things like ""they're probably going to microchip the vaccine"" and ""Bill Gates wants everyone to get the vaccine so we can be microchipped, you should see the videos of him yelling about it!"" I kind of shrugged it off by saying things like ""mom what the hell? I do not believe you are an anti-vaxer"". I started noticing growing tension with my parents when I'd call them. My dad would be relieved that he had someone ""with a level head"" to talk to and would note it's ""hard to keep the peace in this house"".  It made me worry. My dad and I are very much alike and both struggle with anxiety and depression. We get each other in ways that my mom and siblings don't. So I wasn't surprised that we agreed on some of the crazy things that was being said as a result of my mom's Facebook deep dives. Both my dad and I hate Facebook, for different reasons and deleted our accounts a long time ago. So we only knew about what she was telling us. 

I honestly tried to ignore it. Thinking it would go away once things cleared up a bit. My mom and dad both got their COVID vaccines. I was very happy, considering they are high risk and our neighbor just recently died of COVID complications. 

Now, yesterday. I decided to stop at my parents house. My mom wasn't there, she was out at the grocery store and so I just talked with my dad for about an hour. And the things he was telling me absolutely crushed me. He was telling me how he doesn't even know what to talk about with my mom anymore because anything he says somehow gets brought back to conspiracy and she gets pissed off. Example - my dad: ""I was reading a list of the top best actors and number 1 was Tom Hanks. Now I don't like Tom Hanks and had listed to her other actors I liked better. She responded to that by telling me that she despises Tom Hanks because he drinks baby's blood... and I just looked at her and said do you really believe this crazy stuff? I just don't know what to do. Even when I stay off of politics it comes back to this conspiracy stuff."" My dad feels like he can't even talk to my mom anymore without her getting pissed off and spouting conspiracy theories and arguing with him about them. I feel awful because of this pandemic he is stuck in the house with only her and he can't ever voice his frustrations. He says he doesn't know how to keep the peace. He told me he is more depressed than he has ever been. I could hear the frustration in his voice. He looked like he might cry. Seeing them interact now, I can sense the tension. This is not the marriage they used to have. 

We discussed at length just general frustrations with all of this QAnon conspiracy and political discourse. When I left, (and my mom had come back from the store - we had stopped talking about it when she returned) he walked me outside to my car and before I got out of the driveway, he told me ""thank you. It feels good to let some steam off to someone."" This just broke me. I can't imagine not having the support of your long term significant other with this. My boyfriend is constantly a source of support and someone I can voice daily political frustrations with, and I'm depressed my dad has lost his person to this conspiracy. 

What makes me especially concerned, because I obviously love my mom, is her side of the family has a history of Alzheimer's disease. My mom is 66. I worry that her falling to this conspiracy is an early sign or may exacerbate symptoms later. Maybe that is a stretch, but I saw what Alzheimer's did to my grandma, and I've since been hyper aware of early signs. This person just does not seem like my loving mother that I grew up with. I know this quarantine has put pressures on a lot of relationships, but QAnon has surely exacerbated this in my family. 

Thanks for letting me vent. This was just yesterday, and I'm still feeling numb. Worried about my dad. I plan to try to call/visit more frequently if I can so he can have a resource to vent. I just try to steer clear of deep conversations with my mom. I have also noticed small ways she has lashed out in our conversations. I try to change the subject. I cried to my boyfriend last night. He has suggested some kind of intervention. I just don't see how that would work.

1356,"Why ""just divorce"" isn't always the right answer.","Okay, I'm prepared to get a lot of shit for this, but I think that someone here needs to say this. I will add a disclaimer that I am not a professional in any field related to divorce. I am a current spouse of someone with Q-like beliefs and also faced a similar dilemma when I was leaving an extreme religious group a decade ago. Divorce is an option that I considered at various points in my life, but never did.

First of all, there most definitely are situations here in which ""divorce him"" is the only reasonable advice. These certainly include the cases where the spouse has been physically abusing them or threatening abuse (especially if a gun is involved). In these types of cases, there is really no room for considering the other factors that I mention below.

I am also not claiming that divorce shouldn't be seriously considered in many other cases here too. Many of us with Q-spouses are really suffering right now. But I have often wondered, how many of the people jumping to recommend divorce on every post have actually been married? More importantly, how many of them have ever been through a divorce?

Before considering divorce or advising others to do so, consider the following:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Not everyone who currently believes in Q is completely hopeless. In some cases, there is a reasonable probability that they will eventually stop believing in it. Those cases are probably relatively rare, but they exist.
2. If one has children, child custody is a really serious issue. It may seem obvious to a Reddit commenter that the sane parent (the non-Q-follower) will get full custody, but it doesn't necessarily work that way in the real world. I know plenty of very good parents who have lost custody to worse parents, including over religious reasons. Some people live in very conservative areas where there can be a concern that being seen as the liberal may be harmful.Putting that aside, 50/50 custody is the default in many places (as it should be when non harmful-parents are being considered). There is no reason to automatically assume that the judge would move away from this norm because one parent believes in conspiracy theories. Would you want to have your kid spending 50% of their time living with just your Q-Anon-believing ex?
3. Even if the custody itself is not the issue, consider the potential effects the Q-parent can have on the children without the moderating influence of the non-Q parent. That is a concern for many reasons. Some Q spouses will agree to not discuss the issues with their children, or at least be less extreme, if they think they can improve their marriage by doing so.
4. As much as we would like to believe that everyone just has the ability to divorce whenever they would like to, there are severe practical obstacles that can make the prospect of divorce worse than that of marriage. There are people who would have issues with their immigration status if they divorce. There are people who cannot afford the costs of divorce or lack the ability to support themselves. The idea that everyone can just divorce reeks of privilege.Obviously these issues are secondary in the case of abuse, but they aren't necessarily in the case of having a non-abusive Q-spouse.
5. And finally, for some Q-believers, the Q belief hasn't completely consumed every other aspect of their personality. There may be other reasons why people may want to see if they can make it work.

Life is complicated and divorce simply isn't the solution for everyone. People should be a lot more cautious when recommending it.",QAnonCasualties

1358,Update: Q-OH was thrown out of the house by me back in October,"Edit \*\*\*\*Thank you for all of the wonderful responses\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - to answer a point about 'contacting his friends'  
Someone posted a point about me contacting his friends, and seeing that as hostile. I want to explain my thoughts regarding this:  
I made specific contact with a couple of very close friends who have known him for over 30 years. When he had his first breakdown they all told me categorically, that they would do anything to support me and him. So contacting them was really not 'hostile' in any way. I reached out because he needed someone who might be able to remind him of the 'old' days, or ignite a positive memory. So much of what Steve Hassan talks about is the isolation cult members feel. I can't support him very well at the moment, but his friends were happy and grateful that I had contacted them. I am sure this would be different in other cases, but I genuinely believe I did the right thing. 

Dear QAnonCasualties

I thought it might be useful to update some of you, about how things have gone since I told him to leave. After 10 years since his first breakdown, and then the following depression, he fell into the conspiracy theory hole about five years ago, maybe longer. At this point he has therapy and medication for depression. We have two children together, and we have been together 15 years.

Trump was suddenly the only thing he talked about around the election in 2017, and HRC was just evil.We tried to carry on, I tried everything, gentle questioning, screaming, crying, shouting, ignoring. Nothing would stop him trying to evangelise his beliefs.

We started therapy this year because I could literally take no more. It seemed to really help, but nothing touched his beliefs.

Finally I told him to leave after he blatantly told my daughter that Covid is a hoax and only designed by the world government to change our DNA. I snapped and that was that.

5 months later he is living in a shared flat, still working 100%, but is completely detached from the life he used to have. I allow him to see the children for a few hours a week, he doesn't ask for more. (So far he hasn't argued at all about money, and is paying for the house here - so I must just clarify that)

To the odd friend he has left, he says that everything is my fault, I am crazy and neurotic and I changed since we had our children and takes literally no responsibility for any of the break-up.

Now he sends me videos of songs he is learning on the guitar. However I know he is furiously watching bit chute as he shares these videos with his friends.

I have begged any friends that still speak to him to contact him and try and keep him 'anchored' as much as is possible in the current climate of Lockdown. I used to wake up and hope that maybe today would be the day when he climbed out of the rabbit hole. Maybe it will be tomorrow - but it seems unlikely.

The reason why I am sharing this is because I thought that losing his family and his home, and regular access to his children might shake something loose. However it hasn't. But what it has done is shown me that I was in a really toxic environment and now I no longer dread him coming home - as he doesn't have a key to the house any more.

If you are considering leaving a Q-partner - it is likely that you have already given a huge amount of love, forgiveness and compassion. If you are truly miserable then it is time to move on. You. Deserve. More.

The idea here is to ask a person to pick a specific fact claim they think is true; a claim which motivates them to behave in a certain way, and then examine it by using questions. \*\*\*When you challenge a person's beliefs directly, people can take that as a criticism of themselves. But if you challenge the METHODS of forming that belief, it's viewed less of a personal criticism, and yields better results in the end.

**DO's**

• ask them what evidence there is to support their claim

• ask if there is any way we could test that ""evidence"" to see if it's false. (For eg. if there is no way to test a claim's validity, how do we know its true?)

• ask if that evidence may have come from a biased source

• ask what evidence could be presented that would change their mind, if any

**DON'Ts:**

• Don't show them a Snopes or Politifact link and expect them to change their minds right away.

• Don't tell them what to believe, your goal is to help them make their own discoveries

• Don't try to refute premises or evidence, even if you know you can. Talk them through whether or not it's a good reason to believe something.

\*\*\* **SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO ASK THEM:**

• Is speculation a reliable method for concluding things are true?

• What would be the disadvantage of evolving any of your views?

• How important is it for you to have beliefs in your mind that are really true?

• Do you want to go around with as many true beliefs as possible? Despite the costs?

• How can we test this belief to see if it's leading you to the right conclusion?

• Does speculation always lead people to the truth?• Do you think it's possible to have beliefs that give us comfort or purpose, but are not true?

• Just because you like what someone has to say, does it make it true? yes or no?

• Not everyone shares your view,....so what is their main argument against your position, that you think is valid?

• Can you come up with a fault in your own argument?

• On a scale from 1 to10, how confident do you think your believe is true? It sounds like you would require evidence to move you down \[the scale of confidence\]...so did you use confirmable evidence to move you up?

Keep focused on their process of thinking instead of presenting facts to refute their position, this tends to move the needle in a way that preserves your relationship better.

Good luck!",QAnonCasualties
1361,Scared to reach out.,"I don’t have anyone close in my personal life that has fallen down this hole. Plenty of those around me, however. The stories here break my heart and I can’t imagine how so many of you deal.

I have followed this “awakening” since it really took off during the pandemic. This all has caused me to take a serious look at my faith.

I was raised Christian, specifically southern Baptist. I have strayed from THAT to non denominational. I recently discovered that a couple that I’ve known for years, who is huge in the non denominational church I attend was one of the many removed from Twitter for sharing q propaganda. Dude. This really upset me. If what if it’s the whole damn church?! I have left fb, but prior, many, MANY of my clients have showed that they believe the same. (Anti-mask, hoax, baby eating, Biden is evil and going to convert us to Islam, it was antifa on Jan 6th, etc.)

I am struggling with my faith and I want to find someone to talk to. Like, it’s really upset me. Therapist or counselor just to say it. To voice it. But I’m terrified THEY would be Q. I live in the south, in the Bible Belt. If anyone knew this, I would be shunned and that’s not good for my business. I truly believe that if some of these people knew how I felt, they would find someone else to groom their dog. So I stay silent. I have to make money. 

This may not even the right group to ask this question but I felt if anyone could relate, someone here could. Does anyone else feel suspicious of everyone around them? Anyone look at these people and say “are they misinterpreting God, Jesus, their religion or am I? Is this what it’s been the whole time?” My whole family is GOP but haven’t traveled down this road, yet. It makes me so sad. My heart goes out to all of you effected.",QAnonCasualties

I’ve already asked my Qmom how she knows the places she gets her news isn’t telling her what she wants to hear (after being accused of the same thing) and the answer I got was barely any better than “because shut up.” So I have no idea if this would even manage to sow doubt.",QAnonCasualties

1372,How to Deprogram: Instill Doubt,"The user, [u/Glad\_Post2785](https://www.reddit.com/user/Glad_Post2785/), brought this up in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l8u8l7/a_theory_on_how_to_help_the_bullshit_bubble/), and I thought I would emphasize her point here again, because it seems to be the most common way that QAnon followers eventually escape the cult.

Similar to any religion, doubt is one of the most powerful tools that the mind can manifest to override a belief system.

Those of you with QAnon family members (low/moderately off the deep end) have probably already noticed that ""reason"" and ""debate""  with them is futile.

However, if you **engage with your family in a field that they are receptive to or have expertise in**, you can inquisitively ask questions to help them notice cracks in their own beliefs. (they are also more inclined to listen if there is no sense of combativeness). As the previous OP stated:

&gt;My mother briefly believed that Bill Gates had microchips in the vaccine. I asked her to think of it like a cell phone. Cell phones have to be charged every day. How would that work inside the body? Cell phones can lose signal in random places. How would that be prevented inside the body? Cell phones are expensive. How expensive would it be to put multiple, tiny machines inside every American's body?  
&gt;  
&gt;It seemed to click almost instantly. I poked holes in the bullshit bubble and away it went. She is fully vaccinated and claims she never actually said those things (likely due to embarrassment.)

Now try to think creatively, what is something your family member is knowledgeable about? How does that knowledge conflict with their conspiracy theories?  Engage in an inquisitive and curious way, as if you are also wondering what the answer to your question is (even if you already know).

Anyway, just trying to reiterate the power of Doubt. I feel for all of you, good luck dealing with your family, and always remember to reach out for someone to talk to. You are not alone, you will get through this.

EDIT: The cell phone example is not the best, however, it is just an example about how to **take information the QAnon believer can relate to and inquisitively create doubt** (using a guise of ignorance).",QAnonCasualties

1374,Losing my family to Q,"This is my first post here, I just recently joined but before I start I want to say it’s been really validating to realize I’m not alone in this. So thank you to everyone sharing your stories. I know it’s not easy to do. 

My entire family is in the Qanon cult except for my sister and I and to be honest it is starting to feel like a losing battle. My parents are the worst of everyone and no matter what I say I cannot get through to them.

We had a heated conversation a week before the inauguration where they stated they “bet their lives that Joe Biden will not become president.” It might sound crazy but I got some sort of hope from this because in my mind I thought maybe when he gets sworn in they’ll finally see they’ve been fooled by Q and finally come back to reality. But unfortunately, like every other time Q has been wrong, they just move on to the next conspiracy theory and make up an insane reason for the last one not happening. It’s always “you’ll see.” 

They now believe the inauguration was fake and that we have no president. They think the military is in charge and yup you guessed it Trump is coming back to save the day. They’re getting all of their information from propaganda sites, Q Twitter accounts, Q youtubers, etc. 

My sister and  I have tried to express to them several times how we feel and that we feel like we’re losing our parents and they say we are sheep and they flip it on us and say they feel the same about us because we follow “mainstream media” and support Biden. 

It has completely overtaken their lives and become their identities. I tried to explain to my mom how harmful Qanon is and that this might ruin our relationship permanently and her response is to gaslight me and make me feel stupid for saying that, all because she has “a different opinion.” They also now say that Q and Qanon are different, can someone help me understand this? I’m guessing it’s just a deflection but never heard this before.

after school, this family from church picks me up and i stay at their house until my mom finishes work. when i’m there, i play with their 4 year old daughter and introduce her to pop culture because she doesn’t even know about Elsa. one day her dad started discussing about QAnon to my mom and told her that Q says that trump will get back into power in march. this is probably going to be the start of my mom’s Q phase if he keeps going on next time.

my dad is basically a trump apologist, and seeing how both of my parents believe in 1 single person makes it worrying. i have my brother to back me up, but they don’t even listen to him since he keeps asking them to research their facebook information.

My parents used to be very accepting people. I had a friend in high school who came out to me as trans (female to male). My parents respected him and his pronouns when I asked them to because I knew they'd be okay with it. My first few boyfriends in high school were a mix of Spanish/Mexican and Asian descent and my parents never talked behind their backs about them. Basically they were really good people.


As of two years ago, they started becoming more aggressive towards anyone not white or cis. It was a weird complex not of ""I'm white therefore I'm better"" but more of ""I'm white therefore they want to hurt me"" like a victim complex almost. They started talking bad about my sister's boyfriend, who is Mexican. They insulted me for defending trans people when they accused the trans community of taking their tax money for surgery. They started throwing around the N word and became really anti-Semitic to the point of denying the Holocaust ever happened. It was heartbreaking and uncomfortable to see them go down that route, and I've noticed that that seems to be a trend with people in QAnon. It just regresses people, and it's something I don't understand.

1399,I may need to cut ties if nothing changes,"Long story short; My previously grounded mother is a Trump worshiper and Qanon/deep state believer. She’s been doubling down on the conservative Right-Wing videos on YouTube since the inauguration, pretty sure she was on Parler,  pretty sure she thinks JFK Jr. is still alive, was pretty convinced that there was going to be a massive power outage, and fails to understand how Trump’s social media banning and the Parler shut down is within the First Amendment.

We’ve had our arguments, but I think (I hope) she just thinks I’m too scared to admit “the truth.” I outright said, under no uncertain terms, that I’m not ride or die for Biden, I just chose the lesser of two evils. But to my mom that immediately means I’m simping for the guy.

I overheard her saying to my brother (who likely believes too) that she expected arrests during the inauguration. Then overheard her going on and on about the treason Baiden committed, while ignoring the laws Trump broke and the treason HE committed. And how “god will reveal everything.” (I was raised Christian, in recent years I’ve been agnostic. But in recent days I’ve been considering atheism or deism.)

I’m unemployed and living with her, going to great lengths to keep myself from listening to that shit so I don’t get pulled in because she’s watching that stuff all the time now. I’ve even talked to my therapist about this, but with Zoom appointments, I’m afraid my mom will overhear me.

I’ve been hoping she’ll realize she’s been played when the goalposts keep moving. Hope she realizes that the people she’s been watching are either parroting misinformation or in it for the clout.

For people hearing about Q casually in the news, it’s not believable what a serious cult this is and how dangerous it’s become.  My Mom was a completely  normal suburban Mom.  Now she believes that...

* Biden is dead and we’re seeing a clone
* JFK Jr is still alive and come back as the (Republican!) VP
* SAndy Hook, 9/11, the Florida shootings - all a hoax or inside job
* Trump is divined by God to save the world (FFS)
* Trump has declared Marshall law and is leading the world,  to just the US, with that POS Flynn running the military
* DC is under siege
* all debt is being forgiven (but fuck those commie socialists!)
*  All the usual Rothschilds, “Elites”, cabal, baby eating, pedo stuff, sealed indictments
* oh, and yesterday she springs on me that there’s an alien Galactic Federation and she’s part of it

I would assume she’s at the beginning stages of dementia however there are so many others who believe this ridiculous shit that I think she’s in a cult. Because otherwise she acts pretty normal when we’re not on the topic of politics which increasingly is never.

1402,My mom made an apocalypse cult splinter faction of Qanon.,"My mom always believed in conspiracy theories in one form or another. 

It started with the Obama Antichrist/Birther theories back around 2010, back then it mostly just kept to criticizing the government. This was the case until around 2012, when she got into a lot of fringe mom groups. Then she took me out of school, and for 4 years I had no contact with humans outside my family. 

Then Trump came in.  
My mom believed everything the ""God Emperor"" said. My mom's Facebook friends started to spread conspiracy theories, like that if Hillary became president kids would be taken away from parents and abortion would be mandatory. Eventually the Qanon conspiracy came in, and suddenly New York city was supposedly executing Christians and ""Satano-communism"" was defeated by Donald Trump. Every time a major tragedy or disaster happened it was ""the Satanic Jew democrats"", and she would put out a toxic Facebook post to state that.

Flash forward to the election. She got really into the end times stuff, and was convinced that Biden being elected would bring the ""thousand years of darkness"" (funny thing, I actually did some research to counter her, and found that there is more supposed evidence that Trump is the antichrist than there is for Biden). She claimed that the antichrist was an ""unholy trinity"" of Kamala Harris, Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci (think of it like the Power Rangers), with Pope Francis being possessed by Satan himself. Her blend of Qanon and end times cult belief claimed that Biden had been dead for years and was reanimated by the ""antichrist"", and that with his election being Christian would be made illegal.

She genuinely believed that Donald Trump is the second coming of Jesus and that he would execute the ""Satanic liberals"". She believed that democracy was demonic and that fascism was ""God's way"". By then she was leading 2 or 3 Facebook groups with around 15,000 members each, with members even more gullible and toxic as her. She would preach her convoluted theory to her followers. 

She saw the riots and cheered on the rioters, but within a few hours she was blaming antifa on the attack. She saw Trump's second impeachment as the ""second Crucifixion"", and that January 20 would be some form of ""resurrection"" with a mass execution of ""traitors"", and when that didnt come, she started talking about how to ""fight against persecution"" and how the Democrats would send squads of masked soldiers to execute Christians.

1403,QAnon aunt withheld my grandmother's Covid diagnosis; she died yesterday,"My grandma was 94, in a nursing home that hadn't yet gotten any vaccines. Like many others in the world, my region's old folk's homes have been hit very hard. I thought it was understood that if you contract the virus, you tell the people you've been in contact with. Not only is it at the least a decent thing to do, it's in the context of a serious, world-halting pandemic.  


This aunt, who I declare completely disowned, is a Covid denier. She wound up the being the contact for anything to do with her mother, so when they told her my grandmother tested positive, she promptly did absolutely nothing. A hoax, she thinks it's all a hoax.  


My father, the brother of QAunt, had been visiting their mom up until as recently as yesterday morning, when he brushed his hand on her face as she slept, not knowing she'd tested positive, and not knowing she'd be gone within a few hours. Now he's at risk. He washed up and so on, but knowing my grandma definitely had the virus, he would not have even gone there. He's no spring chicken either, so it makes me scared.  


QAunt was always prone to cults. I forget which one, but she definitely joined a cult decades ago. Ever since then, or maybe even before then, she's always been into ""energies"" and dumb motivational stuff, along with annoying everyone by ending conversations with ""love and light.""

The nonsense festered in her as the QAnon crap she ate started to spill out into phone conversations (from across the country, I should've mentioned earlier) and into Facebook messenger. She started having fights with family members over it. They'd call me because I've been studying conspiracy theorists for over a decade, and I'd supply some argumentative ammo &amp; a solid rock of reality, but QAunt has always been just too far gone. Unteachable, unshakeable.  


She sent my father a big box of brand new conspiracy books along with a **folder** outlining the most outlandish stuff ever. Aliens. Adrenochrome. Transcripts of nutjob YouTube videos that *she transcribed herself and credited herself on*. We're talking absolute mad shit that's really, really hard to read without utter disappointment.  


So I'm grieving the loss of my grandmother, who died yesterday of Covid, and completely enraged at my cultist family member who stuck to her beliefs even when they were detrimental to her mother and endangered my other family members. My grandfather visited often, and he just got diagnosed with lung cancer, so he doesn't stand a chance if he gets the virus. Meanwhile, QAunt tells him that it's all make-believe, and that there's a warrant out for Bill Gates' arrest so stay tuned.

The protocols of the Elders of Zion was published as anti-semitic propaganda by the Russian Empire under the rule of Tsar Nicholas II circa 1903. The effort was to create a scape goat and a distraction from the looming revolution that would take place five years later.

Throughout history this propaganda has been referenced to stir up anger and fear. Hitler found it useful.

118 years later The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is the cornerstone of the qanon conspiracy theory. I would have never looked so deeply into this nonsense if it were not for a former friend that insisted I watch a documentary that supported the qanon conspiracy theory.

1408,How can I bring my dad back from the dark side?,"My dad joined the Q cult roughly two years ago, maybe more.  He has always believed in conspiracy theories in some form or another (9/11 was an inside job, etc), so I was disgusted, but not completely shocked when I realized he was apart of QAnon. 

He is completely obsessed with the 'Hollywood elite' satanic cabal, pedophile ring, adrenochrome thing. The last time I saw him, it was ALL he talked about. He absolutely drove me up a wall, but I kept quite about it for the most part. He also believes that the CIA has been broadcasting some weird radio waves (or something to that affect) and that they are completely controlling everyone's brains. Super weird, I know.. ALSO. He is into the Blue Beam project, which I'm not super familiar with. My point is, he is DEEP in the conspiracy theory trenches. 

Now, my dad is a super cool guy, or was. I've always thought he was intelligent and just all around great, so this whole ordeal has been mind boggling and pretty awful.

Me and my sister got into a huge blow out with him a few months ago and we didn't speak for awhile. We both had enough and essentially told him so. He proceeded to tell my sister that she was going to hell simply because she said that she would never be a republican based on recent events. It was just an all around bad argument. We have all since made amends and now it doesn't get talked about, which is great, but it's still unsettling to know that he subscribes to the QAnon theories.

How do we bring him back from the dark side? My biggest concern is that he's going to flip out and rip our heads off if we show concern or tell him that his theories are dangerous not only to society, but also to his mental health.

Does anyone have ideas about how this can be handled in the least aggressive way possible? Any input would be great. Thank you!",QAnonCasualties

I was talking to her when she asked me “do you know what adrenochrone is?” As someone who knows a bunch of conspiracy theories I knew what she was talking about. I’m afraid she’s believing the conspiracy of drinking adrenochrone and she even brought up QAnon a couple times. 

Now my mom is someone who is super easy to be tricked and is spending a lot of time on the internet. If she’s not on her phone she’s on her laptop, if not her laptop she’s watching Fox or Newsmax.

1413,I'm a Qanon Casualty of a Different Sort,"TLDR: I got addicted to anti-Trump content and, in particular, anti-Qanon content.  Ironically, this sub's advice for helping Qanon addicts has helped me, as well.

I started caring about politics halfway through college when years of cognitive dissonance finally shattered my fundamentalist, conservative worldview.  I grew accustomed to being angry about politics, partly because I was already conditioned to be by my Fox News- / Rush Limbaugh-consuming parents and partly because I had become the isolated leftist in my politically-opinionated family—always on the defensive.

Watching my parents embrace Trump (after me thinking Trump's nomination would finally make us allies for a bit) turned that political frustration into a mild obsession.  The rise of Q, especially in the past year, turned that obsession into an illness.

Ultimately, no one in my immediate family came out as a Qanon supporter, at least according to my siblings (my parents and I no longer talk politics, period)—just some cousins who our family doesn't communicate much with anyway.  Honestly, I'm both surprised and grateful.  My parents are hardcore conservatives and big into conspiracy theories (Obama is a secret Muslim Manchurian candidate, the media is trying to destroy Christianity and make kids gay, global warming is a hoax meant to establish a one world Marxist dictatorship, etc…), so I had assumed they would fall deep into the rabbit hole.

Still, so many of the stories here remind me so much of my past experiences with certain family members.  And...I now recognize these stories along with content on other ""Qanon observation"" subreddits have fed an addiction eerily similar to the very ones I'm ""observing.""

What finally woke me up were the descriptions of how to help qaddicts by reminding them of all the things they enjoyed before they got sucked into the cult.  I realized how much of what I loved just wasn't part of my life anymore.  I realized how much my past self had faded into something grey and dull.  I know the pandemic has had a major role in my decline, and not everything I used to enjoy even exists right now, but guzzling political rage-fuel hasn't exactly helped.

More importantly: even though I have no control over pandemics (viral or memetic), I have control over my own behavior.

Following the advice from this sub, I've focused my past two weeks on resuming things I used to enjoy: reading, playing piano, coding, cooking, exercise (ok, maybe I don't exactly *enjoy* that last one).  I've initiated more non-political conversations and activities with friends.  And it really has helped.  I feel so much more like myself.

Of course, it also helps that Trump lost, Qanon is being recognized as a terror group, and vaccines are being distributed, but this subreddit definitely gave me the shove I needed to start rebuilding a life worth living.

1420,I’m developing a website to place a customized message to my Q dad,"I am working on a website to place a customized web page and message from me and my family that will be specifically made for my dad.

I have the bare bones up and working. I have a domain, free web hosting and am currently coding the site. I’m pretty good at developing websites since I’ve run one in the past so I should have the whole thing up and running in the next few days. I’m creating the templates for the pages now and then I’ll just have to fill them with content after that. 

Here’s my plan.. just when I think my dad couldn’t find a less credible website that he believes is credible he somehow goes and finds it. He finds them one after the other and each more obscure than the last. It’s incredible, honestly. So, I want to take content from other websites and place it on this site. I don’t intend to make any new rumors or anything like that. I don’t want this site to do any more damage than Q already does. However, it does need to gain their trust at least a little bit. So, once I fill this with content and then continue to put more farmed content on it daily I’ll send it to my dad. He’ll eat it up for sure. Then after a week or so I’ll send him the link to his custom page. 

My hope is that this will show him just how incredibly easy it is for ANYONE to create a website and any content they want. I’m hoping that this will once and for all help him see that this is all a conspiracy since I am the one behind the site. 

Then I got to thinking.. I see some incredibly heartbreaking stories here every day. If I’m going through all this effort I might as well help some other people along the way. I will design a page for you and your loved one(s). These pages will have no internal links from the main site so no one will ever be able to access someone else’s custom page. I will send you the link to your page when it’s live and then you would have to forward the link to them.

1425,Xanax and conspiracy theorist,"My situation is an older brother who’s weaning off Xanax after addiction (as an outpatient). Recovery seemed hopeful- prior, he had a good life: friends, girlfriend, career... I thought it was a blip. But since COVID, he has become a conspiracy theorist. No longer works. Dedicates his time to posting on Facebook. It’s difficult to connect because his rants are arrogant and judgemental. For example, I bought a new iPhone and got a lecture about big brother state. My daughter got a selfie stick (she’s 12) and he condemned my parenting. He shouted that my mom was a sheep because she watches the news. Any credible journalism is now deemed ‘propaganda’. Social media rants about forced sterilization in third world countries are common place. He stockpiles food.

Some videos he watches are from people who seem aggressive with zero credibility, but he sees it as truth. I’ve witnessed information bias at it’s best. He cherry picks anything that supports his theories and discards what doesn’t. We all naturally do this which is why it’s important to stay open minded and respect others’ opinions. But he doesn’t- conspiracy theorists don’t. It’s an extreme mindset where they feel they know more and need to ‘educate’ rather than live and let live. This is why it’s so destructive to relationships. Who wants to talk about heavy, dense global topics and extreme political views constantly? It’s draining. Even if they mean well (they are fearful for us) they become intolerable to be around. He has no sense of humour or lightness any more. He thinks the elitist are using COVID to implement a New World Order. I’ve started keeping my distance because I need a break from how he makes me feel (antagonized and frustrated). In direct contrast, he seems to be keeping his distance from me as though he has ‘lost respect for me’ because I’m one of the sheep.

I’m considering why this happened to him. Perhaps the depressive quality of the drug has helped him fall down this rabbit hole of fear. Maybe he replaced one addiction with another. Could he have mental health problems after using Xanax? My hope is once COVID has passed and these apocalyptic events did not materialize, that he will wake up. Focus on recovery and get back to really living. Get a job, meet a girl.... I can’t fathom staying in this fear-based mindset for years and years. 

Anyway, there is no resolve at present as he won’t listen to anyone and is too argumentative. It sure feels good to vent though. There is a sense of loss and alienation about the situation. I can’t reconcile this person with the brother I once loved and respected.",QAnonCasualties

She skipped grades, she was successful in her career, she was bright and beautiful and whenever I visit that country everyone fricking tells me about it nonstop.

Her father was a physicist, and her mother was a doctor in the army. She was, in essence, born with a “good brain”.

Today she sent me a deranged YouTube video touting a ridiculous statistic: 20% of people die from vaccines. She’s retired and isolated and spends all of her time reading Q shit and sending it to me.

I couldn’t get her to grasp that 20% of people is an astronomically high number. 20.7 million Americans have gotten the covid vaccine so far; is it remotely possible at all that 4.14 million have DIED as a result? No! But she wouldn’t hear it. She believes it’s not only possible, but that it happened, and there must be some crazy main-stream-media coverup. 

This is the woman who insisted on teaching me Algebra the summer I was 9.

1433,A theory on how to help: The Bullshit Bubble,"I float off and on to this sub and have been reading your stories. I think I'm getting a better sense of how help people come around and I call this theory the Bullshit Bubble.

Anything that has ever been based on lies will eventually collapse in on itself, even if the end of it is grim. These conspiracy theories are like a bubble that is filled with bullshit. The longer it goes on and the more wild the stories, the bigger the bubble. Big bubbles tend to have a lot of pressure in them hence why some people seem so stressed out. Every Q believer is at a different stage with their bubble. Some are really huge and tense and can't take much more. Others are relatively small and seem harmless until they start to grow. Sometimes several small bubbles come together, like when people think of an evil Satanic cult being the reason behind abortions or something. People's viewpoints and information can squish together into bigger bubbles.

Now these bubbles have to inevitably pop. In unfortunate circumstances we see suicide or violent behavior. Others seem to come around on their own or with help from loved ones. I think the way to help people is to see it like bubbles and that your loved ones are trapped in a bubble. Inside they are still the person you remember, but the barrier of the bubble is keeping you apart.

Every human being thinks a little differently. We all learn and understand information differently. It's like in school when some kids excel at math while others are great at art. We all have our weak subjects, our intellectual challenges. I believe this is why people grab onto these conspiracy theories. The information has hit them in a way that gets them in a weak spot, catches them in a vulnerable place. For some people it's religion, others their fear of government or fear of other races. You can insert anything in there. This is why everyone who follows Q seems to have a different irrational understanding. While identical, they all believe a different version of what is really happening.

Now in order to pop the bubble, we need a small piece of doubt. Doubt can do a lot to our minds. Just look at ourselves and how a little doubt can inhibit our body image, our abilities, and even our relationships. I think we've all experienced a set back from the doubt in our minds. In this case though, doubt will be the tiny hole that deflates the bubble.

Since we all understand differently and every Q person has likely heard something different, it will take some trial and error to find the exact thing that does it for them. From the survivors I've read on here, it seems to take something that connects them to their old self. One guy mentioned taxes. Another mentioned the invasion of the Capitol. The angle will be different for everyone.

This is why it takes people to save themselves. They must find the red flag that waves in their faces, that icon of doubt that pokes a hole in their bubble that allows it to pop. They need something to poke through the bullshit and then it all comes down like a house of cards.

If you've tried the conventional questions with your Q, start trying the unconventional. What's something they know a lot about? Is there a question you could ask from that viewpoint that gets them thinking? I know this is a bit vague but I feel that thinking from this vantage point could yield results.

My mother briefly believed that Bill Gates had microchips in the vaccine. I asked her to think of it like a cell phone. Cell phones have to be charged every day. How would that work inside the body? Cell phones can lose signal in random places. How would that be prevented inside the body? Cell phones are expensive. How expensive would it be to put multiple, tiny machines inside every American's body?

It seemed to click almost instantly. I poked holes in the bullshit bubble and away it went. She is fully vaccinated and claims she never actually said those things (likely due to embarrassment.) 

It can be done and I hope this post frames it in a way that helps you supporters to win back your loved ones.",QAnonCasualties

In college, after Obama was elected, it got worse. My  father started cleaning his guns while drunk and pointing them at me. I begged him to stop, and he ripped the ante to teach me a lesson. ""I have second amendment rights!"" he shouted, ""what are you  an anti-gun liberal?""

* What makes MSM more credible than any other source?
* How do we know expert can be trusted?
* How can we distinguish a true and good source versus someone that is just writing their thoughts (taking into account some more obscure blogs could be a credible source)?

My mom constantly say MSM lie just because they don't like Trump, or have been bought/are own by ""the blue"", or there are things they just don't want to report on or exaggerate or are biased; the latter might be true, but it's not really easy to debate on.

Since there is really nowhere around her arguments, it made me think ""what makes my source actually true and why are they genuinely 'better' than hers?"", because honestly, I don't know. I just kinda assumed MSM (and science when applicable) was true.",QAnonCasualties

I don't really care about what my brother thinks, this isn't the first time he's been cruel to me like this. Somehow, and thus I'm writing this, it still hurts. And maybe it's still the grief of losing a child (just three years now, from leukemia).

1442,"Encouraging people to eNgAgE mEaNiNgFuLLy and uNpAcK NuAnCe is misguided, at best.","Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.

1444,How to trap your Q in a paranoid logic trap,"Last night I tried to make a joke on here that got taken all out of context, so per the advice of an admin, I’m gonna make this a little longer so it doesn’t get taken out of context...

Most Q’s believe there is a secret society that’s manipulating word events, and as crazy as that sounds, I could give a little credit to the idea that there are people behind the scenes that do manipulate false flag attacks, and the media; however it’s not the nefarious baby eating cult Q likes to make them out to be, that’s just called the CIA 😂 Anyway; my point is that if there ever were a nefarious “Illuminati” (again not agreeing or believing in any of this crap, but let’s go down that rabbit hole just enough so we can bait the rabbit out of its hole) so if there was a secret cabal, their goal would be to gain more political power and eliminate the people who are trying to do good; for example Tom Hanks and Barack Obama, cause I’ll be a monkeys uncle before I ever believe Tom Hanks is drinking babies blood. My point is maybe we use their own paranoid logic against them; pose the idea that what if Q was actually the bad guy, using these people as political pawns to gain power to take out the people who are actually trying to take them down. /s “That’s exactly what the Illuminati wants you to think,” 🤦🏻‍♂️ I’ve been down my fair share of rabbit holes, and I like to consider myself pretty well versed in conspiracy theories, and, every good conspiracy theorist knows that you can’t trust anyone. Flip the script on them, and say you believe all of it, except now you wonder if Q is actually the “cabal” and they are being used, first you validate their beliefs, making it seem like you totally agree, but then you flip it. /s “How can you be so sure the Illuminati isn’t using Q to manipulate you for political game? I mean this is psy-ops 101. How do you know you’re not being used to further someone’s else’s agenda by going after the wrong side?” ****I don’t believe that crap, but I’m trying to use their paranoid ideology against them to make them see that you really can’t trust either side, and when it comes down to it they should just start focusing on themselves and get back to their lives. They’ve put all this energy and time into a theory that has no actual effect on their everyday lives. Even if they are right, which I am 100% confident they aren’t, but again let’s go down the hole just enough to catch the rabbit and domesticate it, if they are right what’s the long term goal? Are they gonna be a lieutenant or captain in the new Q army? How does this play out in the long run for their lives? And how do they know they aren’t being used for political game by putting a new spin on tired old conspiracies? The myth of the Illuminati has been around for centuries, then it was the free masons, now it’s political, this concept isn’t new, and they rely on complete strangers to “interpret” these posts, so in a sense they are just following what the “interpreter” thinks rather than their own thoughts. Hope that makes sense... last night my joke was “what if Q is just the Illuminati using their own biography to go after the actual good guys?” Again that was a joke, but the logic holds, how do our Q’s know for sure they aren’t being used by the actual bad guys?",QAnonCasualties

Feels like I'm falling into a rabbit hole myself (venting!)","These past few days have been an emotional turnmoil and really hard for me.My bf believes in the most outrageous parts of the Qanon, the whole satanic cabal, pizzagate, etc. When I first met him I Knew he was a lil out there with his ideas and beliefs, specially when he said if I knew about David Icke, which fortunately I didnt at the time. Now, I know and I despise the guy tbh. With the lockdowns my bf went full on with the whole covid ""plandemic"", dismissing it, complaining about the masks, thinking the vaccines are killing people. And he started following a bunch of influencers that were not overtly Qanon but spewed the same bs, oh and the silliness of carta magna article 61. When he starts looking at these videos and posts he gets all worked up and tries to talk to me about it. I try to ignore or change the subject or answer with yes or no; but sometimes he will get mad and confrontational telling me that I don't care and I have no opinion on important subjects like that and basically call me stupid. The worst fights we had are becasue of all this non sense since I dont want to watch a non stop David Icke or because I dont engage with his ideas. Latelly I notice I feel super anxious , reading everything about qanon, covid and in this thread because I want to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like there might be hope but really since he has a very addictive personality, poor critical skills and not much media literacy (Being clever is not the same as smart) im trying my best to keep some sanity but its really hard.

1448,Had to tell me mother... Peace Out,"MY mothers side of the family are all neck  deep in Q. They even had Trumpmas this year, where they gave each other Trumpybears and Trump Bobble head dolls.  My aunt, who I feel is  racist too because she adopted a dog from the DFL and complained she had to change the dogs name.... it was Dora, and she couldn't have a dog named after an illegal immigrant. So, she starts rambling on how Dr. Fauci is an idiot and he made Covid-19 when he went to Wuhan to force socialism on the United States and to make us submissive by wearing masks.  

When I asked her where she got her degree in infectious disease, the family started yelling at me that he did because he was in China, and now I had ruined their Trumpmas. Yay! THat I didn't mind, but I am angry I couldn't get my hands on a bobble head so I record myself driving over it several times. 

The whole time they were talking about all the arrests and martial law, and the Trump executions. SO I didn't talk to them until after the terrorist attack on the capitol and the inauguration. I figured that would at least bring my mother back to reality.... but noooooo.  WHen I brought up the fact I was laughing at all the Q's online crying about being shafted, she got mad. WHen I asked her if she had heard about getting her vaccine, I got screamed at. ""No one is going to force me to take a vaccine for a fake virus!"" 

I remind her that her son in law just had a liver transplant a few years ago. SO if she doesn;t get that she probably won't be able to see her daughter and her son in law again, and that I wasn't that keen on getting mine soon (or later, whatever) and that might affect us being able to get together, and her response was simple, and to the point. ""I don't care""

So these delusions, lies,  allegations, and grooming that Trump and Q have been filling her head with  has taken her totally into a fantasy world.  I have no idea how to get through her to her, and frankly I am tired of trying, and seeing her go further down this fucking rabbithole of  idiocy. It is sad when you get to the point where the only way you think you can help a person is by making them feel your absence from their life. But frankly if this is who my mother is now... then my mother died a while ago. She raised me not to be racist and to respect all people, she didn't forced jebus down our throats because she loved the Bronco's more. Now there is a football hating ""christian"" Q husk there.

1450,Q-Influencer Relative,"Read a post here today about somebody who had to turn in their relative. My delusional Cucumber has turned into a Qanon influencer. What is truly astonishing is how fast his channel is growing. He now has professional volunteers to research and write q-news for him and his cohost.

I think his channel has gained popularity quickly because his co-host claims to have been a victim of the satanic cabal as a child. She comes up with all kinds of scenarios she claims to have witnessed. The baby-eating, underground tunnels, breeding people, the whole Q shebang.

It has occurred to me that while my Q-influencer relative might not openly suggest violence, he is actively recruiting... My Q-relative is building a volunteer ""Army of Shepherds of the Sheeple"". He could one day be responsible for what lead a deluded individual to commit who knows what kind of crime.

I grew up in a very dysfunctional family. I had an alcoholic parent who regularly beat me when he was in a bad move. I ended up moving out when I was 15. I have done alright. Attended college part-time after work, ended up with a professional designation, and while I am not rich by any means, I have built a normal life in spite of my past. But, understandably, I was not close to my immediate family. I ended up moving over 2000 miles away from them.

My Q-relative was one of the few relatives I stayed in touch with. I felt welcome in his home. He was always welcome in mine. I have lost a family member. I cannot overlook influencing others to join this Qult. I have judged him harshly over the Q-tube and Q-pod channels.

I really hope he finds his way out. I hope he does not recruit the few other relatives I stay in touch I have into this evil mind-bending thing. There are days I can laugh at how ludicrous the whole Q narrative is, this is not one of those days.

1452,Not super tragic but still quite worrying,"A friend of ours went down the QAnon rabbit hole, I have no idea how it happened. Essentially really nice guy, always friendly and helpful, until at one point he started talking a lot of nonsense about lizard people, then believed the earth is flat, then it got more and more absurd and we had to disengage as he turned quite volatile and frankly I couldn't be near somebody who believed it was fine to use racial slurs and thought it was perfectly OK to ask for laws that allow killing people that don't share your religious beliefs or have a different skin colour. I'm not religious myself, but I don't hate people who have religious beliefs, I always think that is their private opinion and they are entitled to it, like I am entitled to say ""It's not for me"", and racism is just unacceptable.

Recently met his mom and asked her how he's doing, she said he's on medication, apparently had a total breakdown and massive mental health problems, she said it started with him reading some QAnon content and started watching their YouTube videos.

I don't know if his problems were always there and QAnon just were the trigger or if QAnon somehow sucked him in and it totally messed him up. It's just that from really nice guy, he turned into somebody completely else. I am wondering if I should reach out to him, but given some of the things he said, if he still holds those views, then I rather not because they go really against the grain. Don't know if that makes much sense, I honestly don't understand it myself.

1455,I Fell Down the Rabbit Hole,"I completely understand the pain caused by conspiracy theories. I was never into Q, but have family members into it. Looking at their behavior, and the pain it causes for families hits so close to home, because I was there.

I was heavily involved with 9/11 truthers. I am not sure how that compares to Qanon, but the intensity of the theory was probably as strong. Not because of the 9/11 theory, but how it sucked me into other conspiracies. If it was a conspiracy theory, I was into it.

How did it all start? My research into North Korea of all things. During the research, I found a web site where you can have your little podcast and have an immediate audience. It was called Bold Voices. It was a small, close knit group of people who adhered to different things, but mostly conspiracies, pseudo-law, woo medicine, and anti-Semitism. A lot were into discussing the Illumnati, Masons, and Bilderberg Group. Even Alex Jones was too mainstream for them. The political spectrum was wide - from far-right libertarians, anarchists, communists, and center-right/left. However, most were anarcho-capitalists adhering to Rothbard and ZeroHedge. Most pining for the return of the gold standard.

Oh, and Ron Paul was the hero. So you can imagine how long ago this was. So many were certain he would somehow win. The Ron Paul worship was intense. We hung to his every word. He would save the world from the Jewish cabal controlling everything (but was misguided into Bilderberg, Rothschild, etc.). I did not consider myself an anti-Semite, but looking back, I was. Just because I was not a neo-Nazi, and the group was not openly neo-Nazi, does not mean I did not fall for the tropes. I did, and kept those feelings to myself - only showing my true feelings to that group. I feel sick thinking about it.

I was into the group a couple of years. While my family was very concerned about my obsession with North Korea, they were not aware of the other things I was into. I hung on their IRC, and loved the community. I felt I belonged to an exclusive club with all of the answers. It was a gigantic echo chamber. As a person who was rejected most of his life, it was nice to feel wanted and accepted. I will not lie, I sometimes miss that aspect of it. The friends I made. We felt like a family. However, that came at the expense of my own family. I chose Bold Voices over my own, because I felt they did not get it, and one day, they will when the banking system failed, and anarcho-capitalists' will start the process of rebuilding.

See the similarities to the Qanon conspiracy? Yes. I understand falling down the rabbit hole.

How did I finally get out of it? Taxes of all things. A huge subject of that group was tax evasion, and tax protest. They swore up and down certain tactics worked, and I did not have to file taxes. I asked specifically to name one person who used those tactics and arguments and succeeded, then I would try it. I got evasive answers. That was the red flag for me. I looked up some of the tax protesters they were talking up such as Irwin Schiff. His son was very, very popular there as well.

A simple Google search opened my eyes. Not only were the tax protest/sovereign citizen movement wrong, but no arguments stuck in court. Every one of them failed, and led to very serious consequences including heavy fines and long prison sentences. Irwin Schiff spent decades in and out of prison for tax crimes.

It was at that point, I walked away from it all. It was like trying to stop smoking. I had withdrawals. I relapsed a few times. Then eventually, it all faded away. I stopped going to the IRC channel, and disavowed all of the conspiracies. I got my family back, but it took time to repair the damage.

There is hope. There is a way out. The key to getting out is to be as skeptical of the conspiracies as you are of the mainstream narrative. Ask questions. Be skeptical. Ask for proof. Get another opinion, even if you hate it. Be brave enough to hear others out. Accept challenges to your worldview.

1456,Tired and looking to heal,"Thank you for creating this site.  I found it out of desperation in seeking a way to salvage my own mental health.  I have been playing conspiracy theory whack-a-mole for nearly a year now.  With the onset of the pandemic, my wife has slid deeper and deeper into the many rabbit holes of Q.  She rejects any facts that refute her beliefs.  Our communications have broken down to where it's almost impossible to have a civil conversation about anything.  We are fortunate enough to have two homes and have agreed some time apart to sort things out is probably best for both of us.

I found Dr. Hassan within the Resources offered here and am reading his work to better understand what I'm dealing with, how to rebuild what was once a loving, trusting relationship, and learn strategies that I hope will lead to her deprogramming.   I'm also seeking a good therapist who can help me build a healthy self and help me break what may be a cycle of codependence.  So two questions:

1. Are there any therapists out there that users of this forum can recommend who will help me deal with this in a more healthy manner?  How can I select a reputable, yet affordable one who maybe offers virtual sessions?  I do have insurance that might cover some of the costs, but the therapist would need to be in-network or affordable out of pocket.
2. I'm the sole income for our household(s). She hasn't had a meaningful income in more than 15 years.  She suffers from rejection anxiety so badly it's nearly impossible to convince her to apply for work.  Asking questions about how she is using her time results in an angry backlash.  Any suggestions that she stop feeding her fears and anxiety by doom-scrolling far right forums causes her to accuse me of trying to control her and censure her information sources.  It's similar to the ""you can't tell me what to do"" attitude of a rebellious teen.  Dr. Hassan encourages supporting the loved ones we're hoping to deprogram, but by continuing to provide financial support, am I enabling and encouraging more rabbit hole adventures?  Is there a point t which I should withdraw financial support like a parent would with an errant teen?

1459,How to approach couples therapy w/ my Q?,"I’m looking for a little guidance on how to approach couples therapy with my spouse. My wife went down the rabbit hole and I initially made the rookie mistake of confronting her on it and trying to disprove her new beliefs, her information sources and what she was hearing from her new friends. This has really made our divide worse but thankfully she is still open to going to therapy.

As I’ve looked into how couples therapy typically works, it really is pretty aligned with what I’ve read here as the best way to deal with Q loved ones. The focus is on rebuilding connections through memories together and spending time together talking about things other than Q.

As we meet with this new therapist, I’m wondering how much I really should go into all the Q stuff. Sure Qanon is in the news quite a bit these days, but I’m not sure I can just drop that I think my wife is a batsh*t crazy Q follower and expect the therapist to take it from there. Confronting her again on the conspiracies she believes in may again do more harm than good and perhaps we’d be better served just focusing on our relationship.",QAnonCasualties

The last time was a bit explosive as I lost my cool while she went on her rant about Trump having signed the insurrection act, the military is in control, arrests will be made, I need to go stock up on food for my family, etc. I just screamed at her for believing all of this bullshit!! I was really really hoping when Biden was inaugurated she would have some clarity but turns out she is doubling down. Biden is not president, it was a deep fake filmed on a movie set, the military is in control and trump is still president. So I told her I wanted her to know I still love her even though I think she is on the crazy train, she told me she loves me even though she thinks I'm stupid, I said ""goodbye, I love you idiot.""

1462,You are not alone in your losses. I suffer the same.,"*- I'm about to go on a rant here. In advance I ask your pardon for any foul language, bitter or otherwise offensive comments spoken during this irrelevant yet heartfelt writ.*

The Qanon mental casualties in my life are many, **but only one really hurt**. Most of the people in my extended social circle who have fallen prey to this **radical** **cult of willful and ridiculous ignorance** are now simply counted as a loss. Nothing more than radicalized dumb-fucks to cast aside. I wish no further contact with any of them - no exceptions. I am really just protecting myself, sincerely not trying to be a dick. I have no desire to fraternize with people whom I do not, and cannot trust.

*- One led to a betrayal of a very close and cherished friendship and brotherhood, all for an ongoing simple-minded and sadistic mind-fuck fantasy. Out of respect, I will keep the identities and or identifiers anonymous.*

A person whom I dearly loved as a brother for over a decade, has fallen to the qanon cult of idiocy. He is now unreachable. *Once a being of light and love, he has now become a vessel of venom and hate, and a mind filled with anger and conspiracy.* **At one point this man was heroically and proudly posed against all forms government tyranny, racism, poverty, inequality, and radical religion - so much that it translated directly to his music.** I have tried to reach out to him regarding reality, only to face a verbal backlash that a true friend would never even contemplate. Back in August, when we last spoke he was off the rails telling me about ""The Storm"" and satan worshiping pedophiles drinking babies blood, and that trump is basically Jesus. Naturally, I could hardly stop myself from hilarious laughter. In the same moment, I found myself standing before him in disbelief, as I completely despise qanon and anything trump for reasons firmly set in our reality. When I expressed my disdain for trump during a casual conversation (normally two bro's talkin' shit) regarding the upcoming election, which I have the right to do, he immediately demonized me, and I may as well have been sipping a fresh cup of babies blood in his view. I had never seen his face so red, never could I have even imagined such hate and violent thought. I decided at that point early on that I could no longer trust him. It completely crushed me to see him defeated by something so brazenly obvious to even the youngest of critical thinkers. I truly thought that he was above it. I was dead wrong.

*- This person is not what I would label as simple or a genius, just your average joe with the gift of music from the gods themselves. (I try my best to remain ambiguous regarding religion.)*

This guy was just born to write music. As bandmates and business parters, we shared this passion, and it shined via the music. His songs instantly reached my heart in ways that I will never shake. We shared stages together 7 days a week for over 5 years solid as brothers with our hearts locked into our craft of music, we crashed in our cars, and in grand hotel suites. We dined on greasy burgers wrapped in a paper napkin with a can of soda, to grand banquet halls overfilled with champagne and exotic  hors d’oeuvres. We even shared those stages with mega-stars, and partied till daylight with them all after the shows. Life was grand to say the least. We were equally loved and hated. We embodied a musical force which created strong mental and emotional bonds between us as well as our dedicated fans. We were the core of the group, the talk of the town. Random people of ALL walks would often speak to us after shows to reveal that our music had sincerely touched them. On stage, we seemingly acquired a ""wireless"" brain connection, easily predicting one anothers next move without even speaking. The bond was one of the most incredible that I have ever experienced. People in the group came and went, but we stayed and carried on regardless, making our friendship bond even stronger. This created what I thought was a true brotherhood between two genetically unrelated beings. Like that famous Grateful Dead lyric: ""We can share the women, we can share the wine."" - and we did just that. A round of ""no ragrets"" tattoos does apply here. (obvious misplng :P)

We crushed any obstacles in our way. We loved the haters and the fans alike. I had his back no matter what. Even when he was dead wrong, we would sort it out later when everyone's heads were cooled down. That's what brothers do. As we became increasingly popular as a local original music act, I did witness a toxic ego and a harsh narcissism come to the surface, but as a brother...I just pushed negative thoughts aside and kept focus on the music. We sometimes come to also love the faults of those close to us, as it makes them human and relatable. In the end, this inflated ego and narcissism only served to feed his passion for this mindless conspiracy as he became ""one of them."" Looking back, I cannot believe what I had allowed myself to be subjected to for the sake of friends and ""brothers,"" even at our highest point.

*-The ""Willful Ignorance"" Vortex...my only logical explanation.* 

Lately I have witnessed (from a distance) his nosedive down the qanon bung-hole spiral deeper and deeper into ""the abyss of who the fuck knows what."" Nearly everything this person speaks is now hateful, mistrusting, false, indoctrinated, and at the furthest fringes of known reality. Now to hear him speak, it is nothing but hatred and bile...in his world ""Joe Biden is Lucifer, Donald Trump is Jesus Christ incarnate, and Democrats are now demon worshiping baby cannibals,"" all who need to be abolished by any means possible. I cannot call myself partisan by any means, but my moral compass points 180degrees from anything remotely Republican, as well as the damaging and dangerous ideologies that obviously pair with it. At this point the falsehoods are so simple and obvious, that it makes me wonder if it could be just a matter of pride and ego? I assume with some level of confidence that he does indeed know better, but resists the truth out of both willful and genuine ignorance for reasons only god knows why. I have given up trying to understand, and have come to the point of ""given up - giving a fuck."" I am sure that this is just my emotional/psychological defense mechanism, and for damn good reason.

The final straw was when this person called me out on social media as a ""radical leftist,"" accompanied by various Q an Trump-speak insults, in which he unknowingly (one can only hope) endangered my family and myself with physical harm due to the radically crazy right-wing terror cult that he adheres to. Let's just say that I did what I had to do in order to thwart any such situations before things could get out of control.

As cocky and popular people, we have always fought...but fought like normal brothers and sister do. Today we do not speak or communicate in any way. I just cannot allow it. Even knowing that this person is a victim, I had to make the harsh decision to turn my back to him - for good. How could I ever trust this person again? How could I ever trust a person who refuses simple logic which defies the most common of common sense? I cannot. I will not. It is a loss that I may suffer for quite some time.

My ""bat-shit crazy Qanon friend"" is now dead to me. A shell of his former self, and could never gain my trust again. I am sure that he will eventually be forced to re-enter reality, as this is inevitable at some point. As cruel as this may sound, it is truth...I don't wan't his friendship to return when and if he does find himself in our shared reality as Americans.

**FUCK ALL of those who are Qanon. FUCK the repugnant radical republicans shredding our democracy, and most of all, FUCK YOU Donald Trump.**

PS...I hope that **you** read this message. You know who you are. And if you do...**FUCK YOU**.

While she was an anti vaxer and had some differing religious opinions we were able to keep a healthy relationship. My wife and I are pro science Catholic and Republicans.

They post every 5 minutes on social media. They post things from anti-Catholic, to calls for execution, misinformation about vaccines, anti masks, election fraud, and so much more. They are convinced in clones and cgi, etc. My MIL almost got kicked out of Costco when she was here over Christmas for not wearing a mask 

They think Trump is still the president and have attributed this to Christian prophets. They believe Q is a God driven thing. They find ways to twist the scriptures to support Trump and are almost at a point to making him their savior instead of God. They do insist that they don’t do that but....


We have distanced ourselves from them. Taken away their access to our Amazon prime, Hulu, Netflix, etc. we don’t talk to them as often. When they do call they express how disappointed they are in us for wanting the vaccine and wearing masks. 

They have. 15 year old son, my brother in law and live in a Tiny House. My brother in law knows they are crazy. They force him to listen to all their videos etc. Him and I text and talk quite a bit. I try to keep his spirits up. They tried to stop him from going to school on Inauguration Day. They want him to refuse to wear a mask at school. 

About a week ago he went dark. He hasn’t texted us, he hasn’t called us, we haven’t heard from him. My MIL is still posting on FB. We are worried about him.

I don’t think my in laws would ever physically abuse him in anyway. I am worried about psychological and emotional abuse that comes from all of this.

Should I be worried? Is there anything I can do? I’m not sure CPS would do anything? 

Thanks for the advice.",QAnonCasualties
1464,I'm glad I didn't fall in.,"I've been following the capital insurrection.  I started doing some research and it always brought me to q.  I didn't want to dig deep.  I was an ex-conspriacy theorists.  I know how easy it is to fall in rabit holes so I stayed away.  

I wanted to do a research project on the insurrection cause I think the 6th is an important date.  We must warn the younger generation is what I feel.  However, q is a huge part of the 6th.  So now my research lead me down the ""q hole"" (not really I don't believe).  But I can see how people can fall so easily.  I am strong now not to believe this stuff.

Back in the day I would do research into these conspiracies and it left me isolated.  Eventually that isolation lead to depression and I got out.  I still believed stuff like 9/11.  I watched a video proving that 9/11 was not inside job.  That lead to the flood gates opening and I no longer believe anything conspiracy related.  I have theories but that's natural to come to your own conclusions.  You just don't state them as facts.  They are just theories.  

So I didn't fall in but now I would like to help.  I know what these people feel at the end of the day.  People are suffering with stuff that needs counseling.  At least at the base.  I feel that's how we can reach out to them.  

I'm also grateful I didn't get into this and I made the right choices.  I would also like to thank my friend who suggested the video.  I just don't want to hurt people like that.  I never realized how bad it gotten.  At first it was harmless to me, but conspiracies have evolved into something dark that could destroy democracy.  That why I want to help.  Or at least get information on how to help.  Hopefully my research paper I'm doing(independently) can be used to help people.

If anyone wants to reach out personally I can help.

""Radicalization is when someone accepts or believes in ideas that are considered extreme or outside the status quo, Altier said. When someone becomes radicalized, they are so committed to their extreme beliefs that they can't accept the fact that other people believe different things.


Not all people who become radicalized are violent, though radicalization can lead to violent extremism. Some people at the Capitol riot were radicalized, Altier said, but not all committed or even condoned violence.


What is de-radicalization? 

De-radicalization is the process of giving up your belief in an extreme idea. It's also accepting pluralism – allowing for a reality in which we can all hold different beliefs and recognizing that we shouldn't impose our beliefs on others. Extreme ideologies usually maintain that other versions of reality aren't acceptable.

1468,QAnon detroyed my parents marriage and my relationship with my father,"It seems incredible how something so simple like a post on Facebook has the power to start a chain of events with consequences never imagined like a divorce or a daughter-father relationship destroyed

My parents divorced last month after 32 years of marriage, not because one of them was unfaithful, not because they stop loving each other, 32 years of love, more than 3 decades together were lost for a conspiracy theory on the internet!

We didn't notice when my father converted to the QAnon cult, I called it a cult because for all of us who have had a family member, a loved one victim of QAnon we  know that the behaviour of QAnon followers is like the people who worship a religion, the first thing that we noticed was that he started to spend more and more time on the computer.

His downfall was incredible and fast, like the demise of a drug addict, those hours on the computer became nights and the nights became days, he drank liters of coffee in order to be awake to use the computer, he lost his job because he didn't go to work, all that he did was being on the computer in QAnon groups on Facebook, readings hundreds of posts on 4chan, watching hours of videos on youtube or watching the klnews looking for signs, nothing else matter to him. His obsession for Trump was the worst, Trump is like the God of the QAnon religion.

All he can talk was QAnon, Q, the plan, the deepstate, paedophiles, Trump. A bunch of nonsense, for him discovering QAnon felt like a blindfold was removed from his eyes (his own words) and that he could for the first time see the reality, for him pledging the allegiance to QAnon  was his baptism (his own words) and he even said that he was enlisted to fight. It was a weird religion with a kind of religious war.

He was a different person, even his physical appearance deteriorated quickly, my mother tried to help him but every time she asked him to bathe, to go to see a doctor, to look for therapy started a fight, he became enraged, he throwed things, he punched walls, he yelled every time my mom suggested him to stop o discredited QAnon. he tried to converting us too and every time we rejected him he had a rage.

We didn't know what to do, we could't do nothing, it was like seeing someone falling into a deep hole, my mom desesperate and worried had enough and we went to the basement where he had his tv and computer and grabbed the computer from him and smashed it against the floor. He yelled in a way I've never heard him yell, he screamed  and then punched my mom in the face, she fell and he started to kicking her while yelling insults, it was like watching and addicted being depraved of their drug,  his desperation for being on the computer it was the desperation of an addicted! I tried to help my mom but he hit me too but we managed to escape, we literally run from him. My mom out of love for him decided no to call the cops but that day she had enough and we left the house. That day the father I knew die and my family was destroyed.

I've tried to talk to him because I still love him, He moved with his brother who later I discovered was the one who introduced him to QAnon, He is still full QAnon and it's so painful to know he is still consumed in that world of an alternate reality. My father is a professional man, my uncle too, the weren't the kind you imagine would be victims of conspiracy theories but in some way QAnon seduced them.

I still hear in my head my father yelling and I think I need therapy because I have nightmares in which my father killes me, the instrusion of QAnon in our life left us with our life destroyed.",QAnonCasualties

1478,Glad I found out about this sub. I suspect my nephew is Qanon. I’m scared our family can’t recover from this.,So because of the pandemic I haven’t seen my family in almost a year. The only people I see is my mom &amp; dad. According to my mom my nephew is adamant the Trump will still be seated as president. I know my brother &amp; his family are Trumpers but I had no idea that my nephew was in this deep. I mean it makes sense. He works in the oil &amp; gas industry here in Texas which is rampant with Trump supporters as y’all know republicans don’t give af about the environment. Their jobs always take a hit when a Dem is in power. So yea he’s a full on Trump supporter. There’s also a lot of klan members in the O&amp;G industry. He’s friends with a few though. we’re Latino- go figure. We have Italian ancestry &amp; he (my nephew) has Italian from both sides. So idk if he think this makes him superior to other Latinos because frankly I don’t understand how my brother (an immigrant himself) &amp; my nephew (a son of an immigrant) can support Trump. So we got into this huge argument my nephew &amp; I over politics &amp; we haven’t spoken in months. My mom was telling me that he tried showing her all these conspiracy videos about Biden &amp; Clinton being in a pedophile ring. That he told her he couldn’t even look at her for supporting Biden. Did she not care about his little girls. Did she not care that she was helping men put into power who would abuse his little girls. That she had to stop listening to me because I was brainwashed &amp; brainwashing her. Anyway I’m thinking this is what he’s into. He told her Trump would be president in March. I mean it’s insane. I want to confront him &amp; ask him if this is what he’s into but I don’t think I can take it if he says yes. We were a close family &amp; Trump has kind of destroyed us.

1479,Update on suicidal mom,"I posted last week about my Qmom, who was so deep in conspiracy theories that she didn’t want to live anymore.

I just wanted to give and update about her, as things seem to change now.

I started talking back to her after my initial post, as I was afraid for her after Biden’s inauguration. I read a lot about Qanon and I understood a lot about  peoples traped in a cult. 

So I considered her as a cult member, instead of a dumb fuck of a being. It works.

After 2 days, she came back to reality. She understood that it was a scam, that everything they promised her was not going to happen.

But the aftermath is hard for her. She is an anxious woman and don’t know where she is at now. It’s hard for her, since she belived lies for years. She tries to find « truth » somewhere else than Qanon, such as history books and religion. Never been kind to those things.

I talked to her daily. She accepted to see a psychologist for her anxiety. To work on herself instead of working to fix the world. She understood that she fucked up really bad, but she feel guilt for all the things she did wrong in her life. Not just the Q part.

This fucking cult is playing so bad with their followers mind! My mom don’t know who she is anymore, as thoses conspiracy theories were all she knew. It was her entire persona. Now she just feel empty.

Even if she is not a Q member anymore, we are nowhere near the woman she used to be. We have a lot of works to do before we got there. Maybe she will need medications. 

I am relieve but so mad at the same time. I don’t understand how a 4chan post lead to this (I mean I know how it went from there to there but I don’t get how people got so into this bullshit).

Anyway, fuck Qanon",QAnonCasualties
1480,Q-Anon Hooks Gay Hippie Artist Friend,"An old friend of mine doesn’t fit the Q stereotype, but he’s deep in this conspiracy. Let’s call him Will. 
He’s gay but celibate, a painter and devout Hare Krishna. A strict vegetarian. Very suspicious of mainstream society. Will’s Hare Krishna temple provides food and housing, and he makes a bit off his painting. 
I was drawn to Will’s unconventional interests, sense of humor and talent when we met ten years ago. Now and then, he’d discuss aliens and the Illuminati. For a few months I started to believe in that nonsense, too, but my rational friends brought me back. Whatever craziness he was spouting over coffee, Will managed to charm me with emotional intelligence and wit. 
About six months ago, Will started posting favorably about Trump, which seemed odd for a countercultural hippie who had always opposed partisan politics. Then came the #WWG1WGA tags and talks of The Storm.  He made fun of my masked selfies. He sent bizarre messages and links. 
 I had to unfollow him. I won’t respond to his messages. It sucks to throw away ten years of friendship over these ideas. We had very good experiences. But the Q business was simply the last straw after tolerating other conspiracy theories for years. He’s never been so wrapped up as he is now. 
Looking back, it makes sense that he would believe this. He was always suspicious, always lived on the margins. Q isn’t all 55+ social conservatives in rural areas. It grabs lonely, impressionable people of all backgrounds.",QAnonCasualties
1481,Q &amp; Religion,"Q in and of itself is bizarre and exists in a realm of total delusion and magical thinking. However, I was thinking today about how strange I find it that QAnon is so tightly wrapped up in Christianity. As a history nerd, I understand that our nation's identity has always been closely linked with Christianity, but this goes far beyond it in my opinion. I've never seen church and state so intertwined in modern times--- which really reinforces, in my mind, the fact that this is truly a cult. 

I have an uncle who has really become entrenched. When my aunt met and married him 20 years ago (I was about 9), I thought he was one of the coolest guys I had ever met. He had long hair, was a musician who was super into music, had lived overseas for a few years, and was an atheist. I'll never forget that he and his son showed up at my first communion in jeans and a black t shirt. Now, at that age, I had never really questioned my religion (my family is Catholic) but I remember thinking that he was pretty bad ass for doing that and pissing off my grandma in the process. Even when my SO met him about 8 years ago, he was also really enthralled by my uncle's entire aura. He had this dry, almost cutting sense of humor and would play guitar, talk about music for hours, and was just a really interesting guy. 

Now he is really wrapped up in Q and, what is strange, is that he is always spitting off this Christian rhetoric like ""God will prevail"" or ""God bless America"" .. It's really strange to me. 

I guess I'm just venting here but I'm also wondering if anyone has any experiences like this or any thoughts on this relationship (between Q and religion -- not between me and my uncle).",QAnonCasualties
1482,Multiple family members believe in Qanon conspiracy theories. They’re physically making themselves sick and broke and I’m worried about them.,"Hi everyone! I cannot believe this is an actual community and I’m so glad I found it. I felt like like I was the only person going through this. Also, sorry, I’m on mobile. 

I won’t talk about politics on this. Strictly the conspiracy stuff. This all started with my aunt. My aunt introduced this stuff to my grandparents.  My aunt believed that Trump was used by God to fulfill His will in America during his presidency. She believed that the election was rigged by the Democrats and Biden unfairly became the POTUS. This is where things start getting really deep: my aunt watched YouTube and FB live videos from some Qanon guy who told people that Trump was going to take back control of the White House the day of Biden’s inauguration. I might get some of these theories wrong because there was so much, but something about Trump was going to use the emergency broadcast system to update people. We weren’t going to have electricity. Biden was going to be killed or incarcerated. Something like that. You’ve all probably heard of this stuff. Anyway, the day before Biden’s inauguration, my aunt was so nervous because she believed all of this stuff was going to happen that she had explosive diarrhea at her place of work. Not going to get more graphic than that. She was off work the day of Biden’s inauguration. She waited anxiously for Trump to “do his thing” and save America the whole time she was watching it. When nothing happened, she bawled her eyes out and apologized to my grandparents for sending them videos and scaring them. Yet she still believes this stuff and continues to send them videos and share stuff on FB. 

She has sent a lot of these videos to my grandparents. They also believe in Qanon now. My grandmother begged me in the days leading up to Biden’s inauguration to please stay with her at her house because my grandfather has 1 shotgun and I do not have any weapons. She believed ANTIFA was going to storm the streets and kill people at random and I would be left defenseless. She text me close to 20-30 times begging me in a matter of hours. She would have trouble sleeping and would feel sick. Her heart would race from the panic. She checked her temperature constantly because she thought she had a fever but she was just sweating from fear. She bought hundreds of dollars she didn’t really have the liberty to spend on canned food and non perishables. They’ve sent me my aunt’s videos and talk to me about it ALL THE TIME. My grandfather watched Biden’s inauguration believing Trump was going to expose politicians and such and said he was only watching to see “those sons of dogs (I think you know what he actually said and it wasn’t dogs) get pulled away in handcuffs.” Today my grandmother told me that almost all politicians are pedophiles except for Trump. She said they have orgies and drink babies blood. 

Even though this person my aunt is getting all of this information from keeps making these “predictions” that don’t come true or make any sense, my aunt and grandparents still believe that somehow Trump is going to overturn Biden’s presidency and solve government corruption. My aunt tried to share stuff with my uncle and he said he couldn’t finish watching the video she sent him because it made his nerves bad (as in he was starting to panic). My mom thinks it’s all a little out there. (Try a LOT, mom.) I don’t think I could possibly change their minds because they’re convinced my husband is a Satan worshipper because he plays D&amp;D (yes, you read that right; no, he’s not a Satan worshipper; he’s atheist) and he’s influencing my lack of beliefs in Qanon or whatever. I have no idea how to help my grandparents and family not worry themselves sick as they have been. If you read this far, thank you for your time.

Simply put, my mom is not the same person she was four years ago. She has latched onto conspiracy theories and Trump-ism harder than anyone I know. This is primarily because she has bought into the idea of the “great injustices occurring in this country”. Basically whatever Trump says he was fighting against or facing. 

My mom was abused as a kid. Doesn’t have a great relationship with what family she has left. Unfortunately, no one was held responsible for the abuses. Today, she is infuriated and personally moved when she feels like someone has gotten away with something. Anything at all. Because of this, she has become so invested in Trumps words, and without knowing it she has let him take control of her brain. She listens to whatever he says and gets so worked up as if she was the man himself.

I tried to stop her and steer her away from this. I said to avoid the news for a bit, check sources, use logic. Nothing works. She lashes out at people and is so angry she has ruined friendships and is deteriorating our family relationships.

1495,The Fire,"I work with a Qmoron, he believes all the garbage, I never did. I lived in NJ and I grew up in the 80s and 90s knowing full well what Trump was about. People outside of the NY/Philly/AC metro area..unless you lived during that time, you are clueless about Trump. Anyway, so today at work I was standing on the second floor of our building looking out the window at a large group of woods that borders the property. It was a nice shinny day, not a cloud in the sky. My Qmoron friend came up to me and asked what I was looking at. 

""I am looking at the fire in the woods"" (there was no fire), I told him. He looked confused, and I repeated what I said..""that big fire out there, that is coming this way. Someone should call the fire department and put it out."" Qmoron was still confused and told me there was no fire, I told him that he was wrong, there was a fire, and it was his fault if he couldn't see it. 

After a good 10 minutes of going back and forth he finally said I was crazy. I turned to him and said ""Is it any crazier then repeating over and over again that Trump won an election he never won? If I say there is a fire out there enough times, I will believe it, regardless of what anyone else says. I can defy logic just as easily as you can. The fire wasn't real, it is a spiritual fire that will come and cleanse your soul"" (he really flipped on that one)

I told him to never talk to me, never approach me, don't even look at me. You Q ""survivors"" who miss your mommies and daddies, and are still ""dating"" that went down the hole...if you don't cut yourself completely off from these people, you will have no one to blame but yourself. If you have to come on a reddit board and spill your guts to strangers because you lost mommy to Q, then you have serious problems beyond Q. Your sanity is much more important then your mother.",QAnonCasualties
1496,Need advice,"Hello. I have a brother who is 60 with adult ADHD and Aspergers. He's always appeared susceptible to conspiracy theories. I recall him being an ardent fan of Glenn Beck and Rush many years ago. Our relationship has always required work and patience on my side. A few months ago he said he had amassed several styles of guns, that an uprising was coming, and that people like me (I am a Democrat but moderate) need to watch their asses! I said if he and his buddies plan to hurt people, then should he not come and protect his sister? He said i needed to watch my liberal ass. 

Since then, I decided to finally stop speaking to him. I felt threatened. Now, I know forgiveness and unity is possible with many Trump followers, etc., but in this case I have no idea of how to ever care about him again. This may stem from when we were children and he tormented me physically and mentally every day.

Any advice please? Also, I am no longer friends with three people who refuse to realize Trump is a dangerous autocrat and brought on an insurrection at the capital.. I've lost respect for them. Is this so wrong of me?

Thank you!",QAnonCasualties

1498,Trump has ‘poisoned’ the minds of my parents,"I’m not entirely sure how to start this so I’ll just jump directly in. The past 4 years has ruined my family relationships. Before Trump, my parents and I had a decent relationship. Not perfect, but it was good. After Trump came into office (and during his election run), it started falling apart.

I don’t know how to explain other then I see their minds have been essentially “poisoned”. They only listened to Fox News and so started believing a bunch of BS. It became impossible to talk to them about politics or point out what was clearly false. There were so many heated arguments, I finally gave up on them. 

It just got worse and worse. More BS, more lies and conspiracies they were fed (and believed), more of that poison. Even now they refuse to believe Trump did anything wrong, that democrats may as well be the spawn of satan, that Biden is “the worst thing for this country”, etc. 

It hurts, especially because of how Trump’s stance/policies toward people like me (LGBT+) was a serious issue. My parents are very aware of my orientation, I came out years ago. Of course, as a Democrat it’s a joke to them, they say I’m on the wrong side, whatever. I can deal with that better as it’s not so personal. 

I was hoping that getting rid of Trump and seeing the insurrection would have opened their eyes. It didn’t. There’s ALWAYS an excuse to support him and that the media is “manipulating people”. 

It STILL continues. They STILL believe in so much conspiracy nonsense. 

I just...I want everything to go back to how it was before Trump. I feel like I lost them and that our relationship has been divided. I want them back to normal, no one is getting younger and it’s devastating to think they might pass away believing all the lies. That we may never be able to repair this fracture. I guess I’m “coping” with it by ignoring it, but that doesn’t really help ya know?

Thank you for listening to me ramble on.",QAnonCasualties
1499,I just found out that a friend of my mom’s got sucked in.,"Today was a relatively normal day, just doing college work, then me sitting and playing on my phone before napping, and then I receive a text on Facebook Messenger from this friend.

She claimed that 5 cities with gun regulations accounted for the bulk of murders in the United States, and once those cities were removed from the statistics, the U.S. would drop to the 189th out of 193rd in murders worldwide or something. After a quick fact check, I link her a Snopes article that debunks this. She hasn’t responded to this yet, but with her randomly sending this sort of BS, I decided to check her page and OH MY GOD

It’s shamelessly loaded with images of Tweets from “Q Patriot” and contained buzzwords and dogwhistles like “Deep State”, when she’s not tweeting stuff from Jehovah’s Witnesses and other Christian sects that insist they’re fighting the Devil.

I’m not sure what to do. She still hasn’t responded to my article yet, and I’m worried she isn’t gonna take it well. Thoughts?",QAnonCasualties
1500,Thank you for being here and sharing.,"I have been lurking here for a long time without joining and finally made this ""throw away"" account to join. I do not feel safe sharing my story because my situation is very unstable, but I wanted to let you all know that this community has helped me a great deal, as reading all of your experiences made me at least realize I was not a terrible person for reacting the way I have, despite being repeatedly told I am by the q-person in my life. 

I am currently financially tied to my q-person in a way that I am hoping to break free from in the next few months, but until then I continue to experience many things you all have including more recently, gaslighting about me not even knowing who I am as a person, being told I am emotionally manipulating due to getting upset during q-information-dump-onslaught ""conversations"", and more. But whenever those things happen to me, I come here and read a post or two (I limit myself so I don't spiral) and I inevitably see someone else who has gone through something I have, and all of the supportive responses confirming that the OPs are not in the wrong. It really, really helps. 

As I said, I am hoping to make a move in the next few months to break free financially and physically from my situation by relocating and hopefully finding a new remote job. 

Again, thank you all for sharing because you are helping people in the group but also the unknown quantities of people who aren't even in the group or interacting but are reading your stories.

1501,The story of my Qs,"So, I'll try not to babble, but here goes. So, my first Q is a woman I've known since high school. When i moved to the area, she was my first friend in my new school. She brought me into a friend group that helped me gain confidence. As well as good friends. I spent nights at her house, reading her weekly world news magazines and laughing(she got them from her grandma). We would joke at school about how we saw Batboy, or whatever we could think of. Over time we drifted apart but always kept in touch via facebook. I live in a different state and due to work, I've not been online much. Maybe thats why i missed so many signs.

She and her husband have two kids. One of them has a condition that makes her being exposed to covid a really bad thing. Last year, in September, my grandpa died of covid. This is when the first hints started showing. I posted a status about wearing a mask, and she commented on it, saying all kinds of things about how masks were no use. This woman works in the medical field. I was dumbfounded that a NURSE would say things like this.  She did it again on another post. Whats sad is until this comments, I realized she hadnt commented on any of my statuses in a long time. I popped over to her facebook page and started scrolling. Dear goodness. 

She went from one of the nicest, kindest most accepting people I'd ever met, to a full on Qanon, trump loving stranger. By stranger i mean, this woman was so completely the opposite of the woman i knew, that I double checked to make sure I wasnt on the wrong profile. I was not. Even then, I tried to salvage the friendship, I mean, this was my first real friend in high school. Always there for me. She couldnt be that bad right?

January 6th. I'm out somewhere(grocery shopping i think) and come home to the news of what happened. Dreading it, I got online and checked her facebook. She was there. Waving a Trump flag proudly, with a look on her I'd never seen before. A mixture of hatred and I cant even describe what else. Her husband was next to her , decked out in rebel flag wear. Thankfully her kids appeared to not be there. No masks in sight, all of the crowd just standing around looking like they are ready to do battle.

That was it. I was done. I waited a little while, then unfriended her on Facebook. I didnt message her, no last plea for her to see how what shes doing is wrong, nothing. I didnt even want to try at this point. While i cant be sure she was in the group that stormed the building, I'm willing to bet she was ok with it. 

My heart is so sad over this. A 20 year friendship just gone. I'm so angry at this crap.",QAnonCasualties
1502,"Thanks to this group, I no longer feel alone.","My mom wasn't a great person to begin with. She is narcissistic, and has a very obsessive personality. Her main goal in life, seems to always find someone to blame for everything. Mix that in with being an unloving and emotionally distant parent, and you get angry people like me.  


 My mom has been into conspiracy theories ever since I was about 9 years old. She would rant and rave about pedophile rings, Hillary Clinton eating babies, 9/11 was planned, and more. Growing up, I didn't know that many people since I was homeschooled. But the little people I met online or in person, **no one could relate to anything I was going through.**   


I felt so alone in this big world. My friends never had perfect parents, but they had parents that loved them. Once my mom found her passion for her ""research"", absolutely everything and everyone else came in 4th place. Wealth taking 2nd place, and her appearance of being a good mom to others coming in 3rd. Not that her family ever stood a chance for 1st place, but you get the idea.   


Even now, talking with my husband's family about how all my mom ever talked about was the government taking over the world, and how Obama is the antichrist, is so weird. It feels so odd that all of that was my daily life. I lost hours of my youth being forced to watch videos about the Illuminati, all the while my schooling was severely neglected. **Everything you guys are just learning about now, are things I've heard since I was 9.** My story isn't special by any means, but it just blows my mind to be able to read your stories and say ""Yes!! I know what that feels like!!"" 

It lifts the weight of never being understood off my shoulders.   


I know a lot of you are having friends and family that are just learning about QAnon and going down the rabbit hole. But to have a group that at least understands a small portion of what I've felt my whole life, is such a sweet feeling.

I can't talk to him about it and we are opposite now on very important core values.  Even though married just 2 years, ( in our 60's) we have been together 7 and this has pulled us completely apart.  In separating I'm looking for positive boundaries to set with him.    I've listened to Steve Hassan and he is right.  When I confront him it doesn't work... we argue and the divide is greater.  I  did tell him I'm leaving because he is choosing his patriot right wing extremist conspiracy views over me.  He isn't willing to change his beliefs and I'm not wlliing to change mine.  Trying to get past my sadness and find strength to move on and be clear about the reason.    I plan on moving out in 3 weeks and taking a break.  Part of me is still hopeful ( in denial) but I know I have to go and be willing to divorce him if we can't find middle ground.  I'm not even sure that could be possible.

1507,How is it still spreading?,"Now you are going to think I am the crazy one.
But there is something wrong in both the speed at which the Qanon conspiracies spread and the depth of conversion.
There is no conspiracy in the history of humanity that radicated this quickly and this deeply.

One possibly rational explanation is that it has something to do with the extended lockdowns and associated feelings of alienation, combined with too much time on hands.
But while this explains the diffusion it does not explain the depth of conviction the Qanonists display.

There is another trait that distinguishes Qanonists that is often overlooked: many are exhibiting blood thirst and lynching instincts, even originally mild mannered people. What the hell???
How do people who are law abiding churchgoers suddenly crave public hangings without even a trial?

And this is what worries me about. There is literally something ipnotic about some of the Qanon material around.
This is one example: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2140527889418187&amp;id=100003829909020
But there are plenty.

These videos are not meant to be informative at all. The images flash too quickly. It is actually meant to work like the old subliminals. Even using music that creates a loosening of senses.

Many years ago, 25 TBP, I almost got hypnotised by a neo nazi satanist (i kid you not), only for a friend who realised, to elbow me in the arm to stop eye contact. It wasn't pleasant I tell you.

I think Qanonists have literally been hypnotised and humanity is under a psy-op attack with a level of sophistication against which we have literally no defenses. 

Please tell me I am wrong. I want to be wrong.",QAnonCasualties
1508,I hate that my Q father has poisoned my mother's mind,"My dad has been off the deep end for much of my life. It started with obsessively listening to Rush Limbaugh, progressed onto Alex Jones and now this. I've never felt especially close to him, primarily because our beliefs and values were/are so different from each other's. And because of the fact that it's pretty hard to have a relationship with someone who lives in a totally separate reality and thinks everything(literally) is a conspiracy. When he called multiple school shootings ""false flags"" (complete with actors) I thought his beliefs couldn't get anymore repulsive, but then Q came along.

What makes me angrier than anything is that in the past 4yrs, he managed to drag my mother into the rabbit hole with him. She used to be an independent thinker and a rational person. She used to be more open minded and just all around kinder. Now I see so much fear, paranoia and anger in her and it makes me sick. 

We were best friends, did so many things together. Now I have to set boundaries with her and often want to avoid her. I can't talk about current events or about what's going on in the world.
When the subject of covid has come up, she tells me the deaths are inflated, less people died in 2020 than in 2019 and that masks don't actually work. She is also antivaxx and vehemently denies climate change. She seems to hold a lot of hostility towards scientists and educators. I can't watch shows or movies with her anymore that have political jokes or celebrities involved in the ""cabal""  

Whenever she tells me something wildly inaccurate or untrue and I attempt to debunk her claims or have a civil debate, she gets super agitated and defensive. She'll tell me I'm misinformed and runs off to tell my dad what I said so he can tell her that I'm wrong. I, their adult daughter, am seen as this stupid, naive child whose being ""controlled by the liberal media"" 

She doesn't even read the Q conspiracies, or watch far right media. My father is her sole source of information and he is always right, no matter what. He comes off as being so arrogant and narcissistic when he talks about this stuff too..I think that's part of what makes her believe him.

1510,Should I report my Qpeople?,"My older brother A and his wife are both into Q. Last time I visited theit house they spent 4 hours on a crazy, racist, antisemitic rant explaining all about the ""cabal"" and adrenochrome or whatever it's called. I stayed quiet because he's got guns, but I was fucking terrified seeing just how insane this stupid forum made him. His wife just blindly follows whatever he does, poor girl's too blind to think for herself. I stopped talking to A last Thanksgiving because he called the global situation a ""scamdemic"" and threatened to beat up our teenaged little brother for defending me (this man is in his 30's).

Here's the thing: A's an officer in the military. I can't say what branch or rank he has or where he's stationed, but suffice to say he's pretty high up in the ranks and has pretty high security clearances. Since the fall of the Fanta Fuhrer' Fourth Reich he's been posting in our siblings' group chat all about how ""Trump still has a plan"" and ""it's not over"" and yadda yadda. One of our other brotgers is in it too, though I don't know if he's a member of the Q forum. (I still get the messages although the chat itself is muted on my phone.) 

I've been thinking about reporting him to Homeland Security just because I'm worried he might be sharing stuff he's not supposed to with the Q forums, thereby adding fuel to the fire. Should I do it?

1512,Just feel the need to tell my story too,"So...I literally made an account to try and have a place to vent, because wow does this frustrate me...  


Twenty-three days ago, during the nonsense at the capitol, my mom repeatedly posted things showing support of the insurrection. Now, my mother fell down the rabbit hole maybe five months ago, so this was a bit of an eventuality, but I'll get to that later. She was always a GOP girl. I respect that. What broke me was the fact she made it seem like what those people were doing is right but god forbid if BLM riots and does things on federal land. BLM isn't valid because they rioted, at least in her mind. Now, I will not say I handled my argument with her as respectfully as I should have, but again, this was brewing for months and I loathe how hypocritical she's become over those months and this isn't the first argument we've had over where I think Q can stuff his drops. I snapped and called her out on it on one of her posts. Let's be real, we're human too and are prone to letting emotion and frustration get the better of us even if we would rather be polite, civil, kind...well, anyway she then deleted the whole post and then sent me a text demanding I ""stop being a keyboard warrior"" and if I ""hate Trump so much, vote him out"", which is rather rich from someone who believes the election was stolen. I didn't vote in the election but I sure as heck wouldn't vote Republican (for a number of reasons both personal and not) and she knows well that I am left-leaning in the first place.  


I've literally had to block FB from showing me what she does because it's 99% ""WWG1WGA"" and other Qode words as I've come to call them. Things like ""here's a supposedly classified Dem document that has a misspelling that mentions Lin Woods, that has to be significant"" also became VERY frequent citings.  I want to wake her up from this, I even told her before she fell into it to avoid it. But she never listened to me and started connecting dots between Chester Bennington's suicide to Kurt Cobain's and from there to the Clintons' dealings and from there became a loyal Qult member even though she pretends she doesn't subscribe to the mentality. But with each passing country-shaking event that failed to materialize, she gets more and more unhinged with it and starts mixing it with Revelations-grade end of days stuff. I guess I'm just at my wit's end with her. She's the one who taught me all the nerdy things, she's the one I defended even amid her worst days as a parent....she's my mother and it hurts to watch her fall down the slippery slopes of the fantasy world where Trump is supposedly a messiah. And even after he failed to materialize whatever supposed Storm the 45th president was supposed to bring, she refuses to accept that it was all over. Nearly a month of crazy theories and I'm nearing my limit with her and I'm afraid I'm losing her despite my best efforts to pull her back to reality. It took mere months for her to fall this far, I dread to see where she'll be if this goes on for more time. I've even tried explaining it started on 4chan and jumped to a more racist and lawless spin-off of it, but to no avail. Let alone the insane number of failed prophecies, because obviously disinformation of patriots is fine if Q does it to keep the cabal guessing, right?

Wow. This group is really something. Just found it today, and as I read I’m in tears. There is something comforting seeing others with similar stories. 
My brother and his SO are deep, deep in the q anon hole. It’s not surprising, or very disappointing in that regard. I was never close with them. However, they have gotten my mom into q anon. She swears up and down that she doesn’t follow q anon, but it is clear as day that she does just by the other things she says. Believes democrats are going to round her up and put her in a deprogramming camp for being a trumper. All the other stuff, too. She called me almost 2 weeks back to spew conspiracies at me and call me dumb. The entire phone calls purpose was to make me angry I’m sure. 
I’ve decided my best course of action is to just cease communication for a bit. She pisses me off and I piss her off. I’m just over it after hearing it for months and months. What is crazy, she used to be a democrat! Loved Obama, voted for Hillary, even hated trump until a couple years ago. A complete and total change in her personality.

1517,Q took my dad away,"It's hard to talk about my parents. Growing up, my mom was abusive and narcissistic. As an adult, it's difficult to distance myself from my mom because I know she does love me, even if she's sometimes manipulative. It's a very complicated relationship that's difficult to fully explain. 

My dad was always easier. He was easier to get along with. He sometimes stuck up for me when it came to my mom (and sometimes was more of an enabler for my mom). My relationship with my dad wasn't as complicated. We have a similar humor. We had similar tastes in entertainment. My political beliefs stem from a lot of the opinions he had and talked about as I was growing up. 

And then Trump happened, and I watched my dad become a huge supporter and fall into this ugly pit of racism and sexism. My family would call him out on it and he would claim that he was just doing it to be funny. We all told him it wasn't funny. 

His ""jokes"" began to turn more serious. Conservative memes became full on rants and conspiracy theories. I tried to talk to him. He refused to listen and just doubled down. I finally went off on him a few weeks ago on one of his Facebook posts. He became so angry with me that he deactivated his Facebook and told my mom lies about what I said (which caused a fight between the two of us). He's now back on Facebook, but has me blocked. My sister has told me that he's posting even crazier things. Apparently he's also been arguing with my mom about Q. 

I've tried to talk to him, but he won't talk to me anymore. I'm just so blown away by his actions because this was not the father I had a few years ago.",QAnonCasualties
1518,I miss the man who raised me,"I'm not sure if I should post here, but I keep reading this subreddit obsessively because of my parents (but mainly my dad).  They're not quite as far as QAnon, thank goodness, but I have been dealing with their Fox News and Ayn Rand obsession for years and can identify so much with so many posts here.

As general background, both my parents originate from a country that was under a communist dictatorship for decades.  I won't say the country, but will say I 100% understand the idea that Cubans in Florida run conservative, because of generational trauma that they never dealt with from losing so much, and that fear of going ""back to communism"" now is being exploited.  In my mom's case, she was a refugee as a young adult, and is the sort of person who gets mad when people say ""happy holidays"" because she legit remembers not being allowed to say ""Merry Christmas"" and some Christmas songs not being allowed on the radio.  In my dad's case, he immigrated as a toddler so he really does not remember anything, but does remember serious poverty and lack of food as a child, and how much his parents suffered from being forced to flee the regime.  However, my dad became the American dream personified- studied hard for full scholarships through graduate school, got a PhD, and retired very well off.

Somewhere in graduate school, my dad got REALLY into Ayn Rand.  Like, founded an ""Objectivist Club"" in his city and even met her before she died, and to this day his only charities are ones that promote objectivism.  My joke observation is that a lot of my peers got a Bible as a gift when they graduated high school- I got one of Atlas Shrugged.  Which to be fair I read, along with The Fountainhead and Anthem, and was into in college myself until I realized there are serious application flaws to problems we have in reality. (I am pretty convinced my dad will never accept climate change is real, for example, because acknowledging it is and dealing with it is inconsistent with objectivism.) So at my most charitable, I'll just say that I think Rand's works are good for remembering that you should stand up for yourself and what is right, and call it a day because IRL we have things like child abuse and industrial pollution.

My parents started watching Fox News about two decades ago, so the slide was subtle to start but has gotten worse and worse.  (I thought I was misremembering but it was legit nowhere near as bad in the early 2000s- I came across a copy of Bill O'Reilley's first book at their house recently, and he would have been kicked off Fox News now for being a liberal.) And yeah, Obama did not help, and there is definite racism at play- in the Old Country it's really normal so my mom is just upfront that she is (and observes ""my kids aren't racist"" kind of like how you'd say ""my kids aren't into the Beatles""), but my dad always shut her down until Obama-ish.  I think my dad is the sort who thinks that just because he isn't actively trying to kill someone because they are black or gay like he remembers seeing people do in his formative years, that means one isn't really racist (he has def said the South is not actually racist any more, for example).  But yeah, my dad did read *Dreams of My Father* when Obama got elected... and concluded from it that Obama actually hates whites and wants to hurt them because of how they treated him, and that's why he wants to destroy America.  And I won't even begin to mention what Fox News has done to his position on Islam- I remember pre-9/11 my dad telling us about Ramadan and what a beautiful festival it was, telling us about Islam just as he told us about Buddhism and Judaism and all the other major world religions (dad's always been a strong atheist, but was always teaching), and it's just a completely different thing now.

And that's really it- I guess I posted because it's not QAnon, but Fox News has truly made my parents into people I no longer recognize as the ones who raised me.  I know they hate Trump as a person, but voted for him anyway, because they genuinely believe Biden will destroy America and turn it into the communist regime that traumatized them.  Any criticism is met with the retelling of this story, as if the slightest shift left will mean the Leninists will come in and take their house tomorrow or that I'm not aware of the family history, or that their children are just spoiled and don't understand all they did, and my disagreement is disrespectful.  And of course I am so grateful to my parents and all they have done for me, and the hard work they did that enables me to have a good life, and love them very much.  But JFC, I'm in my 30s, and I'm pretty sure at some point I'm no longer just a naive teenager (though ironically of course it wasn't until I gained life experience that I rejected their views!).  And just saying ""I disagree"" is no longer allowed- if we don't agree on everything, it must mean I Just Don't Understand The Situation (at best).  Which, as far as I can tell, meant a ton of obsessing over the Clinton Foundation and Hunter Biden and that's the *real* corruption going on.

We don't talk politics much because this is how it always goes, but post-election my dad's solution to the situation at hand was to reach out to all of his kids and our spouses and start an email discussion about objectivism.  Guys, it was like getting religious tracts in the mail, except your BiL has degrees in philosophy and points out fundamental flaws along the way.  And eventually that's really what it was- someone trying to convert you to their religion.  You cannot dissent about a topic, because that means you are against the religious catechism.  Never in my memory as an adult can I remember my father asking me why I feel X way about something we disagree with- it just means a window so I can be told why I'm wrong.

But yes.  I miss my father who taught me kindness and to march to the beat of my own drum, the process of scientific inquiry that led me to my career today, who thought people who thought differently to you were a fantastic learning opportunity. (I also hate it when people say Trump supporters are stupid or uneducated- all the ones I know are actually really smart, and I think it just makes people feel better about the problem to say that.) I worry that when my dad passes I will remember this version of him more than THAT version, or that his grandkids won't remember what a good man he is (was?).  I don't know why I worry about that- I guess it means I can see the legacy he is creating and I don't think it's the one he would choose if he wasn't so influenced.

Thanks for anyone who read this far, and for what it's worth, I wanted to share a thought that really helped me.  Some time ago I read a memoir by one of the defectors of the Westboro Baptist Church, and in it she says towards the end that she doesn't think her parents are bad people, but they are trapped by bad ideas.  I feel like this is precisely it right now for millions of Americans, and why it's so hard- good people can be trapped by bad ideas, and once they are it's so hard to help them escape.",QAnonCasualties

It made her angry and frustrated that I constantly disagreed with her comments about how Trump would save us all. No amount of audio/video or printed evidence could sway her thoughts. To her, Trump was the savior sent by God. I had to block her from my Facebook page because she kept posting Qanon videos. I haven't spoken to her in 8 months because of her Qanon beliefs and her annoying separation from reality. Facebook is the cause of this because they allowed Qanon to flourish. She seemed to be in a Disinformation Loop between Trump, Fox, Newsmax and Facebook's Qanon groups - all of her sources of information were repeating the same lies and it allowed her to believe falsehoods were factual.",QAnonCasualties

1523,Effort post on the state of the community,"I'm using a throwaway account here but I'd like everyone to know I've been here since nearly the beginning. This sub was so important, to so many of us and we've been chased out to a discord. The problem is anyone new coming here for help is missing out on what we had. 

I want all of you to know, this isn't an attack or me judging you. I'm sure you're here for the right reasons but I'm going to do my best to explain the damage from how things are done now. This is being written by a few members of our discord, and any examples of people being spoken about were with their permission. 

Originally this sub was meant entirely for support. I didn't know how to go about that, and neither did a lot of others. We gradually learned, and all together created a place that we didn't have to feel alone. We felt like other people understood, and that's where I'd like to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't comprehend the post, that's okay. We all make mistakes, but when someone is posting here they're very upset and vulnerable. Some of us have spent months being forced to question our reality, so take that to heart before posting. Treat posting here like you're speaking to someone in a lot of pain, after all that time of having to question our reality coming here for support only to find someone didn't listen, and we misspoke can be painful. All we ask is that you take a few minutes to read, make sure you comprehend and then you post. If that sounds like to much work, or you still don't understand it's okay to ask clarifying questions. Showing an interest and allowing for more venting helps. 

Another issue is that we'd like everyone to treat each post someone makes as if it's there only for them, and by joining in you understand you're there to be support. Not to question anything in the background you disagree with, not to make arguments, not to lecture. Someone is coming here in pain, and most of the time we just want someone to listen and let us know they're okay. This is super important and I'll be using an example of someone in the discord. 

She first posted sort of lightly complaining about distant relatives, and gradually opened up after months to talk about an assault she suffered. A lot of people are testing the waters at first, so if something doesn't sound like a big deal to you it's not your place to say. We need everyone to be open, and accepting so we can actually share. If you dislike the thing someone says, go support someone else. I'm aware how much energy it can take to be supportive, I've seen people burn out over and over trying to help. If she had posted today, she may have never opened up. It's entirely possible a few bad comments would have made her leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's also important for the lurkers, many will lurk before commenting and if they see someone arguing semantics in comments they may never open up, out of fear no one will take their suffering as important, or the issue at hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding trump, and politics I think 99% of us agree. I personally feel anyone lightly supportive of trump is racist themselves, since they can tolerate so much racism. Why it needs to stay out of comments is because, especially in the first post, you'll make someone defensive. This also applies to insulting their loved ones, we're here for the victim. We don't know what's going on in their head, we don't know what they haven't shared yet, we don't know their living situation. I know personally at least one person here got moved left after sharing and getting themselves help. While Q is a racist movement, some people are very ignorant of that. Granted that only makes them racist and ignorant, but if we begin to argue that in someone's post we're moving away from the pain and support.

&amp;#x200B;

This also applies to considering anyone who enters a cult stupid/insane/crazy- they aren't. Please research cults on your own if you disagree, I'm not interested. Anyone can fall victim to a cult, and saying that when someone's opening up will make them defensive. An example of both of these things from the discord is this.

&amp;#x200B;

A girl from Vietnam had very intelligent, wonderful relatives fall into this. They only believed the pedophile/Satanist cult. After a few weeks of that, when someone would bring in examples of racism they'd assume all of that was trying to smear the Q movement. Again, ignorant and racist, but arguing that won't help with the victim coming here. She had her family attacked in her first post, and nearly left before we got to her in private and chased out the useless commenters. It's not a place for your opinions, it's a place for them getting support. That doesn't make this an echo chamber, that doesn't mean we're shutting down other opinions. If you posted here for support and called your family idiots, I'd let it go and help you. If you were someone I didn't like, I'd ignore your post and hope someone else can be there for you. Please don't bring any negativity into their post. 

&amp;#x200B;

This next example is rare, but absolutely vital and I hope can reach anyone who still disagrees. All posted with her permission. It's a perfect example of not knowing someones story and doing damage to them out of ignorance. A member that had left for a few months and came back into all the changes was chased out after an event recently. A fairly small incident triggered her, and she tried writing for support. Not making light of the event, she explained so in her post. She didn't want to open up about abuse, or anything else prior that made this event triggering. So no one knew her situation, she hadn't been back long and things didn't go well. Mostly just ignorance, confusion, focusing on the wrong issue, accusing her of exaggeration. Of course she got a good amount of support, but in a situation like this the little bit of bad outweighs the good. 

This event that probably seems mundane to most people reading, actually completely chased her out of the community again. It's a common feeling with many of us, that we don't belong here. She was doing a ton of work to improve the community and make things happen only she was capable of because of her situation, and burned herself out. Little problems mean a lot when you're triggered, and suffering and in pain. If you're going to reply, reply knowing that.

&amp;#x200B;

This community still does so much good, and helps people on a daily basis, but it could be so much more. If we managed to get the same love, support, and mindset we used to have with this many members we'd do amazing things. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I take the turn and lose most people. The mods here are very sweet people, and that's the issue. Once someone has made it clear they aren't here for the right reasons, or don't want to read someone's post and appreciate where they're coming from they need to go. This is not, and has never been a place for us to express ourselves and receive random bullshit in return. In the Meta thread I couldn't believe how many people didn't understand that. Please take a hard stance, and ban anyone that doesn't make this a place of support. If they misunderstand something we all do that, I get it. I feel a reminder of what this place is can help. Anyone else can go. r/help is harsher on useless comments. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've discussed this for a few weeks now, and the Meta post pushed me into it. There's no intention to hurt or step on toes here, but this is important. 

Deleting posts have done nothing, warnings have done nothing. Three strikes just lets someone hurt others three times. So the only thing I wish to get across to the mods is, you've been treating those commenting with more compassion then you have the victims. You're allowing them to do this, and you're allowing them to chase out hurting people. I know all of us older members of the community have our discord now, but we'd like to be here and help anyone seeking support. We can't do that until this is a place of support again.",QAnonCasualties

1527,I feel like I am losing my cousin for good,"My dad's niece is not full blown Q Anon, but she does believe in an ""elite"" pedophile network run by Hollywood liberals, she's a Covid denier and she calls Tucker Carlson the best representative of her views. She believes the election was stolen. She also defends Q Anon online, and she believes that the left is trying to legitimize pedophilia. Somewhat ironic, because she is also a traditionalist Catholic and defends the church's awful record on child abuse.  But in the lead up to the insurrection attempt, she was defending EVERYTHING, even as it happened.  She posted about the evils of ""liberal"" social media and she created a Parler account.  She has since gone back and deleted the most offensive posts from the day of the insurrection attempt, but not all. She has made it clear that her fundamental beliefs have not changed, she just is not willing to put it all out there on Facebook, fearing retaliation against her business. 

She lives in a different state.  She has not had an easy life.  She was not raised by her parents, and I blame her ultimately conservative upbringing on my uncle's irresponsibility.  And she hasn't had it easy; her father committed suicide when she was about thirty, her mother has mental health issues that prevented her from being very involved in her life.  She married a career military man who is even more extreme than she is. 

 For the last year she has been accusing ""the left"" of wanting to murder conservatives, which freaked me out because it seemed like projection.  When all of the insanity started earlier this year we agreed to talk every once and a while, to try to reach across the gulf.  We shared a lot of personal thoughts, political thoughts.  We had a lot of conversations that ran for hours.  I thought we were getting somewhere to where we could at least respect one another.  The last few months have tested that with our online interactions.  

I badly want to build on this relationship because although we've never been very close, we do share a lot of family history.  When her dad died, I tried to be as comforting as possible given the circumstances (our family was a wreck over it), and she promised that she would remain in  our lives and promised me specifically that she would be there when dad dies which...at the time my dad was 50, and none of his family members had even made it out of their fifties.  Like I said, some traumatic stuff happened with that side of the family.  

Over the years we have had a lot of difficulties over sexuality (I'm gay, she obviously does not approve), religion (she's a devout Christian, I am not) and politics.  With Trump and the conspiracy theories, though, it feels like a line has been crossed. Everything feels more personal. 

This also comes at a time where she has been invited to my sister's wedding and as far as I know plans to come.  She did before the election, anyway.  If she comes, she and her family will be staying with my family, which I am sure will be trying in its own right.  My own family recognizes that she has gone off the deep end, but none of us really know how to engage.  

Just venting.  I've been reading the posts here off and on and I realize this is not out of the ordinary (given the craziness of the times in which we live anyway). I don't really want to pull the plug on this relationship but at what point is a line crossed when it just isn't possible to inhabit the same shared space, because the other person doesn't inhabit reality, and actually, viscerally, hates ""your"" side?",QAnonCasualties

1535,‘Trump Just Used Us and Our Fear’: One Woman’s Journey Out of QAnon,"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/us/leaving-qanon-conspiracy.html

&gt; During the political fallout after four years of Donald J. Trump, one question is what will happen with the followers of conspiracy theories that bend Americans’ perceptions of reality.

&gt; WASHINGTON — In the summer of 2017, Lenka Perron was spending hours every day after work online, poring over fevered theories about shadowy people in power. She had mostly stopped cooking, and no longer took her daily walk. She was less attentive to her children, 11, 15 and 19, who were seeing a lot of the side of her face, staring down into her phone. It would all be worth it, she told herself. She was saving the country and they would benefit.

&gt; But one day while she was scrolling, something caught her eye. People claiming to be sources inside the government had posted on Facebook that John Podesta, a former White House chief of staff, was about to be indicted. And yet on her phone she was watching a video that showed him chatting casually in front of an audience. Around the same time she saw Hillary Clinton, another supposed target for an indictment, walking in Hawaii, looking relaxed and holding a coffee cup.
&gt; 
&gt; “She just wasn’t behaving like someone who was about to get arrested,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; It was the first nagging feeling that something did not add up. Five months and many more inconsistencies later, Ms. Perron, a consultant in the insurance industry in suburban Detroit, finally called it quits.
&gt; 
&gt; “At some point I realized, ‘Oh, there’s a reason this doesn’t fit,’” she said. “We are being manipulated. Someone is having fun at our expense.”
&gt; 
&gt; Her journey out of that world could be instructive: As the country begins to sort through the political fallout from four years of Donald J. Trump, one looming question is what will happen with the followers of QAnon and other anti-establishment conspiracy theories that have been bending Americans’ perceptions of reality.
&gt; 
&gt; There are signs that some have lost faith: Mr. Trump left Washington last week, blowing a hole through a key QAnon belief — that Mr. Trump, not President Biden, was the one who would be inaugurated on Jan. 20. But others are doubling down, and experts believe that some form of the QAnon conspiracy theory will remain deeply embedded in the nation’s culture by simply morphing to incorporate the new developments, as it has before.
&gt; 
&gt; QAnon believers are part of a broader swath of Americans who are immersed in conspiracy theories. Once on the far-right fringes, these theories now hold people from across the political spectrum in their thrall, from anti-lockdown libertarians to left-wing wellness types and “Stop the Steal” Trumpists.
&gt; 
&gt; The theories can be malevolent, causing real-life damage to people who end up in their cross hairs: the parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook mass shooting who have been harassed by conspiracists, or a Washington pizza restaurant shot up by a man who had come to take down a child trafficking ring he believed was housed inside. Q sweatshirts dotted the crowd that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.
&gt; 
&gt; But while much has been said about how people descend into this world, little is known about how they get out. Those who do leave are often filled with shame. Sometimes their addiction was so severe that they have become estranged from family and friends.
&gt; 
&gt; The theories seem crazy to Ms. Perron now, but looking back, she understands how they drew her in. They were comforting, a way to get her bearings in a chaotic world that felt increasingly unequal and rigged against middle-class people like her. These stories offered agency: Evil cabals could be defeated. A diffuse sense that things were out of her control could not.
&gt; 
&gt; The theories were fiction, but they hooked into an emotional vulnerability that sprang from something real. For Ms. Perron, it was a feeling that the Democratic Party had betrayed her after a lifetime of trusting it deeply.
&gt; 
&gt; Her immigrant family, from the former Yugoslavia, were union Democrats in working-class Detroit who had seen their middle-class lifestyle decline after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. As an inspector for the insurance industry, she spent decades in factories seeing union jobs wither. Still, she stayed with the party because she believed it was fighting for her. When Bernie Sanders became a presidential candidate she found him electrifying.

&gt; 
&gt; “He put into words what I couldn’t figure out but I was seeing around me,” said Ms. Perron, who is now 55. “The middle class was shrinking. The 1 percent and corporations having more control and taking more of the money.”
&gt; 
&gt; She felt sure the Democratic establishment would back him, and she began volunteering for his campaign, meeting many new friends in the movement. But she felt that the news media was barely covering him. Then he lost the 2016 primary. When she began reading through leaked emails that fall, it looked to her like the party establishment had conspired to block him.
&gt; 
&gt; She spent weeks combing through the emails, hacked from Mr. Podesta, the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton. Her stunned discovery enraged her and put her on the path to conspiracy theories and, eventually, QAnon.
&gt; 
&gt; “There was no hint of conversation about the working class,” she said about the emails. Instead, she said, it was “expensive dinner parties, exclusive get-togethers.”
&gt; 
&gt; The emails were Ms. Perron’s doorway to the conspiracy world, and she found others there too. She was no longer a lonely victim of a force she did not understand, but part of a bigger community of people seeking the truth. She loved the feeling of common purpose. They were learning together how to research, looking up important people in the emails and figuring out how to trace them back to big donors.
&gt; 
&gt; “There was this excitement,” Ms. Perron said. “We were joining forces to finally clean house. To finally find something to explain why we were suffering.”
&gt; 
&gt; The community was growing, and also going to darker places. Ms. Perron remembers watching and sharing videos appearing to link a Washington pizza parlor to Mr. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton and a child sex trafficking ring. The dots were hazy, but she and her newfound friends on Facebook and Reddit drew bright lines connecting them. It sounds crazy now, she said, but at the time it felt so real and disturbing that sometimes she felt physically ill.
&gt; 
&gt; “It was all of us,” she said of the early months of her immersion. “It was these puzzle pieces that we all got to play around with. We were all sort of authoring this.”
&gt; 
&gt; If the early months were a build-your-own-adventure designed by different groups, all the theories were snapped together into one giant “deep state” explanation after Q, the anonymous person or people at the center of QAnon, first posted in late 2017, she said. Q’s information drops had an addictive effect, drawing her in again after she had started to have doubts.
&gt; 
&gt; “Q managed to make us feel special, that we were being given very critical information that basically was going to save all that is good in the world and the United States,” she said. “We felt we were coming from a place of moral superiority. We were part of a special club.”
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, her family was eating takeout all the time since she had stopped cooking and her stress levels had shot up, causing her blood pressure medication to stop working. Her doctor, worried, doubled her dose.
&gt; 
&gt; People who tried to talk her out of the conspiracy theories by sending her factual information only made it worse.
&gt; 
&gt; “Facts are not facts anymore,” Ms. Perron said. “They are highly powerful, nefarious people putting out messaging to keep us as docile as sheep.”
&gt; 
&gt; As the months went on, the claims she was seeing grew more outlandish. There were slickly produced videos of cannibalism and Satanism within the Democratic Party.
&gt; 
&gt; “The people I got to know on social media, they started to look stranger and act stranger and I didn’t want to be like that,” she said.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Trump himself was a source of doubt. Q presented him as a brilliant mastermind, and for a while she accepted that. But it became harder to reconcile that persona with what she observed in real life.
&gt; 
&gt; Another twinge of self-consciousness came during a phone conversation with a childhood friend. “I remember calling my best friend and getting all into the number of pedophiles in government and that they’ve taken over the whole government system,” she said. “I felt a part of her saying, ‘This is not the friend I recognize.’ It never came out in words, it was just a sense that I had.”
&gt; 
&gt; When she first left QAnon, she felt a lot of shame and guilt. It was also humbling: Ms. Perron, who has a master’s degree, had looked down on Scientologists as people who believed crazy things. But there she was.
&gt; 
&gt; But she has come to appreciate the experience. She has talked to her children about what she went through, and has learned to identify conspiracy dependence in others. She agreed to speak for this article to help others who are still in the throes of QAnon.
&gt; 
&gt; There are many. Ms. Perron volunteers as a life coach, and recently was working with a 40-year-old man who had lost his marriage and was falling asleep at work. At some point, he began texting her Q links. She realized he was staying up all night consuming conspiracy theories.
&gt; 
&gt; “I was watching his life fall apart,” she said. “I had no way to penetrate it. I could not even make a dent.”
&gt; 
&gt; She said she was no longer working with him.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Trump may be gone from government, but Ms. Perron believes that the ground is still fertile for conspiracy theories because many of the underlying conditions are the same: widespread distrust of authority, anger at powerful figures in politics and in the news media, and growing income inequality.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless there are major changes, Ms. Perron said, the craving will continue.
&gt; 
&gt; “Trump just used us and our fear,” she said. “When you are no longer living in fear, you are no longer prone to believe this stuff. I don’t think we are anywhere near that yet.”",QAnonCasualties

1541,Watching Family Fall Down the Rabbit Hole is Heartbreaking,"I love my mom. We've had a good relationship my entire life. She's not without her faults and always solidly republican. However, at the turn of Trump she became more hostile. At the turn of covid, over the past 9 months, I've watched her fall down conspiratorial rabbit holes with a neurotic obsession. I liken it to watching a loved one struggle with addiction: we know it's harmful for them, but they can't help but engage in the harmful behavior. 

I'm an attorney. My entire livelihood is predicated on careful research and making cogent arguments in good faith. I don't really care what people believe; I care about the reasons for believing something. My mom and I mostly don't discuss politics, but I know she's sucked in to dark corners of the internet based on what she says occasionally and by how much she's on her phone watching videos or in message boards. When she says something untruthful, I try to calmly dispel what she believes by asking her questions and telling her to take a step back. But she only falls deeper into the content. 

I so desperately want her to stay off the internet. I've thought about trying to have a conversation coming from a place of love and concern. However, my dad lost his job a while back and my grandfather (mom's dad) was just diagnosed with an aggressive cancer. I'm afraid my mom isn't in the right headspace to be confronted. Simultaneously, I'm also afraid that her fragile condition will only make her cling on to her conspiratorial political beliefs further. I'm afraid that not addressing the elephant in the room is driving a wedge in our relationship. My dad and sister acknowledge that my mom is plugged into dark corners of the internet and that her mental health is deteriorating by obsessing over conspiracies, but they choose to do nothing. I don't know what to do. I want my loving, caring mother back.",QAnonCasualties
1542,I have one question,"Q has literally torn my family apart to the point where half of my family isn’t speaking to the other half.

It has gotten more lonely as the pandemic and election made everyone extra crazy and mean!

I have tried to show her the other Q theories that are clearly crazy like the PizzaGate conspiracy. She says ""yeah those people are nuts!"" and that she would never believe in that stuff, but doesn't understand that the rest of her theories are all part of the same interconnected web of lies that has been spun by Q and the different influencers trying to capitalize on these gullible people.

1555,"Old friend joins cult, finds Q, real awakening","I just cut ties with a friend from way back - I know the recent advice has been to stay close, connected, open and forgiving - but I just can’t suffer the arrogance anymore. A couple days before the Capitol riot I blocked him on all social media after trying to have a simple conversation that was totally ignored and replied to with “4 More Years” 

He’d previously sent me Out of Shadows, the plandemic video, endless links about masks/viruses and theories about how it’s a faked emergency and Democrats are responsible. All of it. I held back a lot from calling out the pointed racism and implicit selfishness. I was still trying to make the effort and be friendly.

This person also joined a cult a few years back called The Enlightenment School. I saw video of their leader saying “god has chosen trump” and it made me wonder how many more pseudo cults were likely paid off to disseminate trump propaganda. I know many homeschool/Christian groups have pooled financial accounts for big political plays. All seems like such a waste of money - and the psychological abuse! Must really get the adrenaline going 🙄 It just sucks so bad seeing this propaganda vampire machine feasting on my friends and loved ones.

I hoped the real awakening would be Q outing itself for what it is - explaining how easy it was to co-opt truth, to fool people into following completely crazy narratives, and maybe how it’s been used by people like Trump to stay rich/keep power and avoid consequence. Why would anyone want to be instructed in revolution by an anonymous presence on the internet anyway? 


As someone who tries to hit city hall meetings and stay on top of local efforts, it makes me furious when people who have joined the political conversation just for the world wrestling federation aspect of “slamming” their opponent, assuming these new confident personalities, and worst of all - no longer questioning.

I love a good conspiracy video as much as the next guy. Somehow a bunch of idiots got together and fooled a bunch of my friends/family to believe/say even crazier things.

1559,I am having trouble getting past the hate for Trump Supporters,"Hi... never used Reddit before so hopefully OK to post here.  I am not ex-Q and I don't know for sure that any of my family is.  But I still feel like a casualty.  I am Jewish and Muslim (another story) and I took a LOT of flack over the last couple decades for supporting Republicans and being conservative.  I feel like I have been watch Q develop since 2001.  People who were friends started saying conspiratorial things about Muslims.  I saw them as very much a fringe and kept defending conservatism and Republicans.  And then Trump started running.  I thought he was ridiculous.  But more and more people started believing his nonsense.  There were claims about Muslims celebrating 9/11 in NJ.  Claims I knew were false.  I started to get worried when I would point out there was no evidence of this and people in the party started responding that THEY remembered the event (an event that NEVER happened) and that the media must have deleted all the footage and articles to cover it up.  


When Trump won I was devastated.  The phenomenom that became Q grew.  I abandoned any defense of Republicans and grew more angry. My family was directly hurt by things like the Muslim ban.  


I think my anger is the casualty for me.  I HATE Trump supporters.  Not just the Q ones.  Anyone who will stand for such low character and lies and terrible behaviour seems to me impossible to be a good person.  I know I am wrong to think that.  But I disconnected from every Trump supported in my life. A guy I know voted for Trump was looking for a job and I avoided helping him.  I feel bad about that.  


I feel betrayed.  Decades of defending small government and telling my non-white-non christian friends and family that Republicans were good and had their interests were wasted in just 4 years.  All that emotion defending a group which turned eventually to Trump and hurt so many.

I have an admission to make that I have hidden for over a decade. I am extremely embarrassed about it, but I hope, if nothing else, it helps somebody.

When I say ""I believed in Conspiracies"", I mean I was in deep. I was terrified my family and I would end up in a concentration camp...that's how deep I was in.

All of the conspiracies I see today are just rehashing old conspiracies that worked in the past. You can connect them. Such as the ""martial law"" conspiracy. This one seems to just be recycled over and over. Same is true of ""secret societies that are plotting against us."" Seriously, I could fill a book of every conspiracy I used to believe, so I'll spare you all of those details.

At the very center of it, its a sense of community, and a sense of belonging. I was lonely, young and figuring out the world on my own, when a friend showed me a conspiracy online. And it hooked me. I thought there were secret societies preparing to send massive amounts of people to concentration camps, that the Denver International Airport was the hub of this operation, that ""martial law was coming"" etc. etc. I could fill a book with what I believed.

As conspiracies play out, the person making these conspiracies will always make predictions. This is key to getting out. The people who were argumentative, and calling me an idiot, and trying to drown me in logic gave me an adverse reaction. I only sunk in deeper, and completely shut them out. People want to use logic and see an epiphany, and it's never going to happen that way. Its a slow process that happens over time, little by little. You're trying to use logic for illogical conspiracies.

 What really helped me, were the people who were calm, welcoming, and really gave me the tools to figure it out on my own. ""What's going to happen if this prediction fails? Have you given yourself time to think about this?""
I was lucky. At that moment in time I had the right person around for that moment. Not everybody has that person around them. Rather than put me down, they built me up, and eventually I traded one sense of community for another. 

Although I still feel ashamed of what I allowed myself to believe, maybe it is time I use my past to help others escape the same circumstances I found myself in over a decade ago.",QAnonCasualties

1573,Lost my Best Friend to Q 😢,"Recently lost one of my best friends to the Q-cult... a little background about him; he was always anti-authority, he always questioned what we saw vs what was there, and he always kept an open mind on things. Growing up he was a Juggalo, a hardcore one, like went to their festivals every year, owned all their merch, followed their stories, followed anything that had to do with ICP, almost fanatic. Now we are both in our mid 30s, most of his Juggalo friends have moved on in their lives, but still support the music, he sort of floundered the last few years not able to pick a path cause he’s always been one to do things his own way. All his best friends now have kids, or are married and he was the last of us to live the single life. Recently he met a girl that was completely unlike any girl he ever dated, usually he was very immature and flirted like he was 16 and treated most girls/women like they were dumb and needed fixing, but this girl was different. He respected her, he liked how she was independent and made her own money. She was a staunch Trump supporter, he never gave a shit about politics except that both sides were corrupt. A few months into their relationship she turned him onto Q, now he went from question everything to only question what Q tells you to question. He truly thought “the storm” was coming last week, and even after the inauguration he said “the day isn’t over,” but the day came and went, now that day got pushed back. In a way it’s like he thinks he is Neo and he cracked the matrix, he has all the answers, and the girl he is with only reinforces the ideas he is now coming up with after scouring the message boards for hours. He went from “I don’t give a shit about politics,” to, “Trump will save us from the pedophiles.” I was trying to explain to him why these theories don’t make sense, and the only response I would get was “you watch the news, you’re brainwashed.” To me it’s just sad that I lost such a good friend. The other day I asked what it would take for him to see the truth and drop this QAnon stuff, and he had the nerve to say, “I hope you don’t get your daughter vaccinated before you see the truth,” now if he were anyone else I would have lost my temper and gone off on them for bringing my kid into the conversation. But he has been my best friend for almost 20 years, I don’t want to abandon him while he’s in the depths of QAnon cause I know it’ll only push him further into that group. It scares me that someone who used to be so open minded now thinks that they have all the answers and that their way of thinking is the only answer. It’s the zealotry of QAnon that really worries me, they are worse than fundamentalist Christianity, and this guy was anti-religion his entire life. He would laugh at me when I would talk about Alien shit, this was a dude who would have rather had anarchy than ever vote in an election. This was a guy who laughed at anything political and would always keep an open mind, never once did he ever pick sides. Now he posts cryptic messages on Facebook and no matter what proof you try to show him, he refuses to read it. It’s like this is one giant choose your own adventure conspiracy LARP and he bought the DLC expansion pack after Biden was sworn in🤦🏻‍♂️ Sucks to lose someone who has always been a good friend, but I can’t even talk to him without him bringing up vaccine conspiracies or Q cult talk.

She thinks the military is in charge and asked me why we haven't seen Biden on Air Force One yet as some explanation as to why he isn't president. (People aren't traveling in a pandemic!!)

Leading up to the Inauguration, I was hopeful she would realize she had been duped because she kept telling me that on the 20th she would accept whoever was inaugurated as President. That day has come and past and she's still ""trusting the plan"", keeps referring to everything as a ""really long movie that's going to have a surprise ending"". It's just so frustrating and absurd. She said she wished she could've been at the Capitol insurrection to feel the ""energy"", she says she has friends who went and it was so peaceful, with lots of praying and singing. 

The more time that passes, the more radicalized she's becoming. It blows my mind because she's losing lifelong friends because of this. I'm starting to realize at the core of these people embracing QAnon is that they're deeply unhappy or depressed about something, maybe they feel like their lives didn't turn out the way they thought they would, etc. I used to think she would come to her senses but after our last conversation, I realize how much this is becoming her identity.

1579,Thank you for your service :),"I know a lot of people got hurt by QAnons. Some of you have made experience with close ones. They know their personalities were good. They were lovely people. And in their heart they still are. But if you havent noticed they got touched so deep, that they can not other then fight. In real not because of QAnon, but of their Values. Believe me they want to love you and be with you, stand with you. But they feel the duty to defend their loved ones before living and loving them in peace. They need to find their peace. And out of their view: you dont understand the fight he is fighting, but he wants you to be save. His goals are his values and he hopes he does right. Believe me if you dont want to let him/her go. He/She wants your best and for that peace (for the they feel). Accept what they are and what they really want to be. Respect them and they will respect you. In deep inside them is still the person you know. You need to know their personal reasons to finally understand them. But it is your choice. I really thank you for your commitment in this reddit. I wish you the best!

I'm having trouble telling how far down the rabbit hole he is. He doesn't like to talk about politics with me since I don't shore up his beliefs.

Are there any subtle triggers I can use to see if he's just an old Trumpster with Facebook access or if he's begun dipping into actual Q territory? I don't really want him to know I'm digging into political topics or he'll clam up.",QAnonCasualties
1582,"My BF is a Q-anon follower, and I need help.","He was such a loving, adventurous person when we met. He’s always been very supportive of me, and just an all-around amazing person. I’ve never fallen for anyone like I did with him. We’ve just had an all-around great relationship, until recently…

When we first met we talked about conspiracy theories like the butterfly- and the Mandela effect and joked about the *“all birds are drones”* theory. It was never serious talk, but more of a *“hey look at this interesting/funny thing I found on the internet*."" We discussed the theories, laughed about them, and then went on with our day. But slowly it got worse...

It started with him reading 5-10 different state media from around the world. (I actually thought this was a good thing at first, as I found with more information you get informed about countries bias’ and able to create your own thoughts about the world, especially with wars and stuff.) But suddenly he started being more aggressive about conspiracy theories. He stopped reading news pretty much all together, and obsessively followed spiritual YouTubers, and alternative independent journalists that talked about aliens, US politics, Jeffrey Epstein, the Deep State, and such. 

Then at the start of the corona pandemic, things took a drastic turn. He had been unemployed for a couple of months but wasn’t able to find any job at all after the first lockdown. So instead he used all his time in front of the computer, playing video games and listening to these YT people. As the months went by and we became closer to the US election, all the YouTubers he followed only covered the election, and Q. 

Maybe I’m naive, but I didn’t really understand the extent of Q-anon until recently. I always just thought my bf was as interested in Q as we were interested in the silly, non-serious conspiracy theories when we first met and that he didn’t take the information seriously. He talked to me about Q, but it never really rang any bells at first. But then he started talking about the Clinton body count, that all these politicians were eating/raping babies, that the only reason George Bush senior was alive for so long is that he drank children’s blood and that he couldn’t wait for awakening where everyone would be forced to look at and admit these ugly things that were happening in the world. 

He started becoming frustrated that I didn’t care about Q, the spiritual/independent journalists he followed, and that I didn’t support Trump. He said I might as well support Biden and his child sex slaves if I don’t support Trump (I am a big fan of Bernie Sanders, but don’t really care about US politics that much as neither of us are American nor live in the US). 

Then came all these dates he obsessed about, dates where something would happen that would change the world forever, where everyone would be forced to see the *truth*. I don't remember the specific dates but he talked about JFK being alive and that that info would be released soon, that Trump would dump all this info about pedo-politicians right before the election, that China was starting a nuclear war, and pressing me to call my family and *warn* them, that there was a prophecy that the 45th president would be the last, Biden would never become president and the 2020 election was rigged. He also talked about Antifa a lot, which I’m not so familiar with, and that they were the ones storming the capitol, not Q or trump followers, and that it was all orchestrated by Democrats. 

The thing is, he’s always been critical of authority, and I have as well, but I’ve been really worried about him for the past 6 months. His plan was to start school again in early 2021, so I’ve kind of just ignored all of his obsessions / told him to stop talking about these things because they made me irritated and feel like shit. I held onto the hopes that when he started school and had a regular, everyday life again, that when the inauguration would go as planned, he would realize that all these theories were bullshit and become the same man I fell for three years ago. Then January 20th came by and nothing happened, as expected, but he didn’t stop. He joked a bit with his friend that they would stop supporting these theories if nothing happened, but we are pretty much back to where we began. 

I’m just so torn. I don’t know what to do. 

I love him to death, but I feel so naive for pushing this relationship for so many months in the hopes of his opinions would vanish in one day. I really want to talk to him about my worries, but I have no idea how. 

So I’m asking, is there anyone reading this who has any advice? Is this a lost cause? Or is there something I can to do make him see that he’s practically a part of a very toxic internet cult?",QAnonCasualties
1583,I still want to try to do it and I hate myself for that.,"After Pizzagate, I though about how it would be fun to  mess with these people.  I wasn't upset with Trump as much as I was upset with my fellow Americans.  I really thought we had made so much progress from when I was young (segregation, open racism, commies infuriating the  government).  So maybe I was angry with my own naivety.  So I had this really great idea.  Then Q came and I immediately thought this guy will overplay his hand.   But apparently, that's impossible.  Then I wondered why he doesn't cut and run since the hoax was getting out of control, when I realized that the temptation of that power over people is hard to resist.  For Christ sakes! Q was as dangerous as handing loaded guns to toddlers and threatening the nation yet I was infatuated with the idea that a hoaxster could topple the government.  I still want to try to see if I can do it too.  the only thing that holds me back is the fear that I would be culpable if people got hurt or killed.

I told him I don’t regret having my kids and he can say whatever he wants and if he wants to sign them over to me, he can.

He told me he feels shunned because I’m not on his side with anything and I’m not fighting for our family.  I told him I feel shunned by him ignoring me constantly and twitter being his priority. I told him Q is everywhere (screensaver, stickers, his clothes) and I can’t take it anymore. He says Q is the closest thing to the truth.

1602,"""Save the Children"" doesn't extend to their own children.","If you live in America, you are most likely aware of the overburdened and understaffed social services programs. This existed long before the Qult. Now more and more, we're hearing/seeing stories of children, who previously had loving parents, now having violent and cruel strangers for parents in their homes whom they do no recognize. Many children were already in homes with violent abusers who were then radicalized towards more violence with Qanon. It is so cold out in these streets this time of year. I encourage anyone who has a little extra to donate to local runaway shelters. You can also donate care packages as well. Things like toothbrushes and toothpaste and those sorts of items. I also encourage people to go with their **gut instinct** in the case of inviting someone into your home. I know it's cold out, and seeing other people suffer pulls at the heart strings of most people, but not everyone is a decent person, no matter how innocent they look or how much you do for them. If your gut is giving you the sketch vibes, you should probably just follow it. You can deal with the self guilt later. Maybe donate to a shelter or something of that nature if that might make you feel better. It's better to be safe than dead. But that being said, some of my closest family are people I've met through a shelter and they did live us growing up. But still. Please be safe. If you're in a situation where you want to call for help, I would call a youth shelter before calling the police in most situations. Many times police will just take the kids back home to the abusive environment.

We need to tweet/call/write to our congress people, encouraging them to write an emergency bill to make the path to emancipation for minors  (16+) easier as well as allowing them to acquire the funds that would have been given to the foster parents, so that they are able to get a place to stay and have food. Many experience abuse through the foster care system and I'm sure many foster parents have been radicalized with Qanon like many other parents. Emancipation for as many 16+ children as possible would allow them to bypass possible abuse, as well as leave good homes open to younger children who are not able to care for themselves. (I want to be clear. I value 16+ children and children under 16 all the same. All kids deserve a loving home. But a 16 year old can take care of themselves an 8 year old can not.) This is in response to many children being home with abusers (Qanon and other) with the quarantine and not being able to escape with school, as well as the dangers of Qanon parents being driven to acts of violence towards their own children for questioning Qanon and the Qult. If you are a patient, loving, kind, and financially able person who feels able to do so, I encourage you to open up your home to fostering, if it's something you're interested in. It may be helpful for children processing this trauma to have a foster parent who has been through it and can understand what they are feeling. If it's not you thing, that's ok too. Don't feel pressure to do anything you aren't comfortable and prepared to do.  

**If you do help someone on the streets, etc, please don't put it** ***(pics/vids of them, their name, their face, their location, their backstory)*** **on the internet without asking them first. I know it might be hard or feel weird to not post it on reddit/instagram/facebook/tiktok/etc. I know it's great to feel like you have an opportunity to prove your goodness to the world, or to show people what you're doing with your life, or to just document your life for yourself, but these people are running away for a reason. They are running for their lives. Posting even the tiniest bit of info about them can get them harmed.** It's really easy to forget that sort of stuff or just be oblivious to it if you don't have any prior experience. It's probably not intentional, but it unfortunately happens enough that it needed to be mentioned

1603,The Lowdown on the Q Op.,"All this nonsense about it being a White Supremacist cult, etc. etc is complete bunk.  
Q was referring to the drops.  The Anons are the people who deciphered them and put their own spin on them on message boards, so when the media was lumping some of the theories or interpretations of the Q drops, it was lumping it all together and just demonizing it all.  
After reading lots of the drops and looking for any sort of hope within, I've come to the realization after they went silent last month, that the entire thing was a Potential Problem ID project, or people who will fight the Machine/Illuminati/Globalist/Cabal/WMA/whatever you want to name the massive network that is behind basically everything wrong with the world.  


That's it.  A Dissident Harvesting Program.   It worked well, it got lots of people to show their hand and identify themselves as people who will not go along quietly with the agenda they have for everyone.  


Many of us made the Red List long ago before there was a Q.  Many of the people now just waking up are playing catch-up to what's really happening.  So, yes Q was most likely an elaborate plan to rally the troops so the system will tag them and put them into the list.    


The real issue is, a lot of what they said was and is true.  Not all of it, but a lot of it.  You can't just outright lie to people or they will know, you have to use spin and the truth.  


That's my opinion.  The child trafficking rings are real, that's been a thing for a long ass time, and people have been whistleblowing on that for decades, as are the sacrificing of children.  Look up the official stats on how many kids go missing daily worldwide.  It's over 20K a day.

1609,Replacement Fascination: Cahn and Praying Medic,"Hey all,

I’ve posted a bit about my Qpartner previously. Since it’s way too painful for me to post too much I prefer short posts.

Anyway, he has been into Jonathan Cahn for a few years. Pretty sure he owns every book he’s written and has read them more than once. He keeps one or two by his bed with the Bible for cross referencing. My Qpartner believes he is a true prophet. 

About 6 months ago he ordered a small library of books from The Praying Medic. He has those scattered about the house kind of hidden. In all honesty I’m not sure what they are all about. I do know The Praying Medic is on the far right and has been banned from the common outlets.

Since the time he ordered the Praying Medics books, my Qultist has become increasingly reclusive. He now works from home by choice,
something he said he’d never do. So rarely leaves which makes it hard to have any sense of peace at home. He works, reads his books, listens to online preachers, reads the Bible and talks about his relationship with God. There is NO intimacy at all anymore between us. I’m guessing it’s probably not something that fits in with his newfound relationship with God. Tonight, he actually said he wants to “fall in love with God.” Not just love God, fall in love. In addition to the lack of intimacy, he hasn’t said one kind word or phrase for weeks. No I love you, you look nice, etc. He will thank me for laundry, cooking or housework. Otherwise there isn’t any space in the room for me. 

Don’t get me wrong here, I’m not knocking Christianity. I am a Christian. You know, the kind of Christian who believes in actions being
the relationship you show God by loving and serving people to the best of my ever growing ability.  What I don’t get is the extremism. Now that he’s starting to possibly doubt Q, I guess he needs something else to obsess over. There was a time I was hoping his focus would return to our future and relationship. There is a part of me that’s saying it’s best he’s not. It opens the door for a new future. 

I’m wondering if anyone else’s Qultist is transitioning to another obsession. It makes sense that some are trying to behavior replace with something.

"" ... Banned from most major social media outlets, they have found their people on encrypted apps like Telegram and on extremist message boards. Qanon has become a truly international movement – some of the sites founded to host the lost herds cater specifically to adherents in countries outside the United States, including Canadians. Experts estimate though the conspiracy theory has spread to over 80 countries, Canada has one of the five largest populations of Qanon supporters in the world. 

But even as these people have found their kindred spirits online, they have left heartbreak out in the real world. Family members have founded their own online communities, where they commiserate and share advice on how to talk to fathers, mothers, wife and husbands who they feel they no longer know. 

One of the most popular is a Reddit forum called QanonCasualties, which has attracted its share of Canadians whose family members have become acolytes. Some are angry, others bewildered. Some talk about family members who had always been prone to conspiracies; others say that until recently, they had been on the opposite end of the political spectrum, moderate or completely politically disengaged. Some use dark humour to cope with the major personality shifts they've witnessed. 

It's a forum that has brought Jackie some solace, as her father's obsession with Q “killed our relationship,” she says. Where once her father was “a man's man,” who was into fixing cars and carpentry and had very little interest in politics outside a passing admiration for former Toronto mayor Rob Ford, now the only thing he wants to talk about is Q.""

I have a friend who is deep into QAnon.

Lyrics

I wouldn’t say that censorship is the answer

But best believe that they’re all making pitches to shape you

Back then was different, you’d carry the address on paper

And share it with your friends

And he was searching, de-sensitized to mayhem 

At age thirteen

I know, in history

That’s not quite rare

But this new reality 

It’s so detached

  
 Where you can pull up a torturous murder in seconds

Rewind and watch again 

He’d seen it all through the CRT in the basement

That’s when the towers fell

Not everyone that we lost that day is departed

They’re typing at their screens

The catalyst

Here to enlighten you, and to illuminate conspiracy

 

Can we bring him back?

It’s been twenty years, imagine that

It’s not too late to turn around

Hold onto the child of the old days

Before all of this, back in the eighties

They get ‘em young

Ensnare those kids with blood, gore, porn and games

Eyes to the screen, have them revel in some faceless persons’ pain

Till empathy is foreign, distant, grin as anger takes its place

And now the ploy is done, the trick complete, this con will self-sustain

Don’t let ‘em look away

Don’t let ‘em look away

Don’t let ‘em look away

Don’t let ‘em look away

Don’t let ‘em look away

I know this was posted once before, but I want to bring it to awareness again.  It is an interview with a person who is researching this and can explain the basics. I think they have some reasonable advice on dealing with people who are getting into this, though I think for some there is no way to do that.  They also provide info on what sites are not safe to go to if you want top leas learn more, and give some that are safe.

It’s not worth it folks. These people are not brainwashed they are just racist to the core. If you know people that went down the rabbit hole it’s not worth trying to bring them back into a civil discourse because they were never there to begin with. The best course of action is to cut them out of your life and tell them that the cable will only be exposed once enough of them commit suicide for the cause.

1622,lost all hope with Qmom,"Here I was thinking that my mom's theories were her own and that she was the only one who fell down the rabbit hole, but after reading people's stories on here, I'm happy I'm not alone. I think she fell down the conspiracy hole around september-ish after working from home during the pandemic. I tried my best to provide her with sources to tell her that her theories aren't true and she would yell and belittle me for being a ""sheep"" and being ""brainwashed"" by the Dems. She started referring to our new VP as ""Kabala"" and constantly yells at the computer and researches stuff all damn day. I can't get her out of the black hole she's fallen into and we haven't spoken to each other for a while bc I voted for Biden and ""haven't opened my eyes to the truth."" When Congress was certifying the election she told me she was going to start taking up my phone for absolutely no reason. She believes the election was a fraud, masks don't work, and that the covid vaccine is a means for Bill Gates to profit and to inject us with the microchip and change our DNA... she is so deeply involved that every day things make her bring up politics. She saw a bottle of wine was made in Cali and she said she didn't want it bc it was made by Dems.... I have had so many mental breakdowns bc of the constant negativity and yelling at home and I can't make fun of her or speak to her bc ""I don't know anything about the world,"" and apparently it's my fault I'm not suffering as much as she was at my age. Please, if you're a parent reading this, refrain from telling your child, ""You have no idea how good you have it"" or ""You don't know what it's like to suffer."" It passes on generational trauma for. no.reason. Shouldn't you be happy that your child isn't suffering like you were at their age??? It's not their fault for having a better life than you did, and if that makes you mad, then you shouldn't have kids, just saying. For reference, I make all A's, don't do drugs, don't drink alcohol, not a criminal, and I'm a good kid. One day I actually worked a double at work because I didn't want to go home and face her. My dad works outside of the house meaning he gets fed all of the theories by my mom when he gets home, and bc he trusts her, he believes the theories too. However, my dad is much more civil with me and things haven't changed between me and him. He started to tell my mom that she was being lied to when martial law didn't happen and they bought a gun, and she got really mad at him. One day she said that she never went against her parents and took what they said for truth, and the next day my grandma told her she was too wrapped up in the theories and my mom got angry with her... but wait?? I thought you were supposed to accept what your parents say for the truth? So why are you not listening to your mom?

1624,Where did all this QAnon crap come from?,"Pizzagate, the Storm, the satanic paedophile cabal, adrenochrome.
Did you ever wonder where all this shit sprouted from?
1)kidnapping children, tortuting, drinking blood:
Originally an antisemitic trope known as blood libel, has been in existence since the middle ages (1144 in Norwich, England). https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel

2) adrenochrome: 
In his 1954 book The Doors of Perception, Aldous Huxley mentioned the discovery and the alleged effects of adrenochrome which he likened to the symptoms of mescaline intoxication, although he had never consumed it.
Anthony Burgess mentions adrenochrome at the beginning of his 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange. The protagonist and his friends are drinking drug-laced milk: ""They had no license for selling liquor, but there was no law yet against prodding some of the new veshches which they used to put into the old moloko, so you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other veshches [...]""
Hunter S. Thompson mentioned adrenochrome in his 1971 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. This is probably the origin of current myths surrounding this compound, because a character states that ""There’s only one source for this stuff... the adrenaline glands from a living human body. It’s no good if you get it out of a corpse."" 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenochrome

3) the cabal of powerful elites of satan worshipping, child murderers
Potentiallly the idea was taken from Stephen King's Dr Sleep (2013), where a similar cabal is described.
Note that Pizzagate first came out in 2014.
QAnon  came up in  early 2017  to reash  Pizzagate.

Conclusion
Essentially nothing  major is new. What is new is that QAnon weaponized it against the Democrats and progressive european leaders. And of course turned fiction into a LARP where  if you disagreed with Trump you must be a member of the cabal.

1625,Can mental illness be spread through ideas?,"QAnon is so far from neurotypical thinking that it seems like some cases might be a form of mental illness. We’ve heard so many accounts here of otherwise normal people who suddenly started acting strange and falling into the Qult almost without warning. Of course maybe QAnon people already had some underlying mental health issues to begin with, and QAnon just brought those mental health issues to the surface. But there are cases of mass hysteria where hundreds of people will believe they have been poisoned etc., and mass hysteria is spread purely through social contact. It’s an kind of psychosis spread through observation of other people. Is it possible that the danger of these ideas is underestimated and that viral or weaponized ideas might constitute an actual public health crisis?",QAnonCasualties

&amp;#x200B;

This is coming from someone who thankfully doesn't have a personal stake in this but has dealt with very similar situations.  In this case, I hope that's a benefit tho: I'm coming at this relatively objectively.

This group touts itself as a support group for people whose live have been jarmed by Qultists.  Not as a support group for Qultists themselves or ex-Qultists.

Given that, even the optics of having someone capable of falling into the Qhole as a moderator on a support group for people dealing with lives being ruined by it is a really bad look.  It looks like a (self-proclaimed) reformed wife beater running a discussion group for victims of spousal abuse.  

And, to be perfectly blunt, having been susceptible to that level of batshit crazy doesn't speak well of their ability to impartially judge anything.  Of course individual cases may vary.",QAnonCasualties
1628,Where do you think is the point of no return for Q followers (if there is one)?,"So far I don't know anyone sucked in it (touch wood) but I do know a few bog standard conspiracists in my family. Outside of Qanon, they pretty much believe it all: Wayfair, Illuminati, COVID, false flags, you name it.  Considering that Qanon appears to be rooted in religion, I guess atheistic theorists aren't as likely to go down that particular rabbit hole. I could be wrong though. 

Anyway, more to the point. Is there a line that, if crossed, there's no going back? Do you think some people are beyond saving? I've read a fair few of your stories and many of them are eerily similar in how your Q families/friends begin their descent. It comes seemingly out of nowhere. Unexpected. If it's that easy to get sucked in, I fear the same will happen to my family. 

If we can find a pattern with these cases then maybe we can pinpoint where exactly they cross the threshold into insanity. As for those already past that threshold, can they still be brought back, if so how? Of course, if you all knew the answers you probably wouldn't be here.

But should it be that simple? These people arent children that should be coddled because they were mislead. They made the concious decision to follow conspiracies that fueled beliefs they already had, Qanon was just the outlet these people needed to spew their hatred.

Personally all of my family is hard right wing besides a select few who ""dont care about politics"". Over the course of Trumps presidency the arguments, belittlement, and hatred became to much and I slowly started cutting people out of my life. 

I dont know how any of them are feeling after Trumps loss, and I really dont care. But IF they have changed their views why should I let them back into my life? Do they deserve it? Did they learn anything? Are they just going to suppress there garbage conspiracies till the next tyrant comes to power and they feel safe lashing out again?

1632,I’m a Hispanic/liberal/feminist married to a white/conservative/conspiracy believing cop. I’m at a loss.,"This is going to be long.

Before I begin, please know this man is the love of my life. Been together for 13 years, married for only a few months. 

Since we’ve been together so long we’re both aware of the others political beliefs. In the beginning it wasn’t too bad-we were young-politics didn’t matter too much. But as the years went on it became more intense; almost like an identity we both developed apart of each other.

2016 happened and we were divided. Me for Hilary, him for Trump. Trump won, therefore my husband (then my boyfriend) felt vindicated and kept saying it was “their time”.
The past 4 years were tough, I couldn’t believe he would support this man; but we worked past it since there is so much more to our life. And our life is really really great.

2020 happened. My husband is NYPD. He was in the thick of the protest and broke up the riots. He has been screamed at, physically harmed and threatened and doxxed. He worked 150 Hours of overtime in one single month. This was a traumatic experience and drove him deeper into the arms of Trump and then Qanon. 

I agree with him that the coverage of the BLM protests have been one sided. I fully support BLM and being POC I understand and fully support the plight. What didn’t help was these liberal politicians not condemning the violence with anything tougher than sending out a tweet-drove people further away and into Q. 

I have such complicated feelings about this subject. It hasn’t been easy. 

Over the past year I took a step back from politics. When we occasionally spoke about it he would tell me little things like “de-classifying documents”,  kept talking about human trafficking and denouncing fox. I didn’t think much of this, since I hadn’t been aware of Qanon or that all of these things he was saying was Qanon. It was only after January 6th, that I became aware of what it was and I became Infuriated and scared.

It came to a boiling point last night that I started to yell and scream and say some ugly things to him. I’m ashamed. I brought him closer to Qanon rather that further away from it.

What do I do now? How can you reconcile being with someone who brings you so much joy, but you’re afraid will turn a corner and you’ll lose them?
How do I make this better and make him see that he’s bought into a lie and this lie is tearing us apart?

1633,Show no contempt for former Q's:,"The initial response a lot for people have when someone leaves an extremist group is to engage in angry denunciations of that person. How dare you! How could you have not seen how it was a scam? The idea is that there must be something deeply wrong with them for them to have fallen for that ideology, because normal people like me could never be in that situation. 

Especially on social media, where the people who denounce the things the loudest tend to get the most attention. It creates a reward mechanism for angry denunciations. And emotionally denouncing things just feels good. It makes you feel morally superior, it makes you feel like you're striking a blow against those that have caused so much harm. And surely, those extremists need to feel deep shame and remorse for what they did. 

If you put any thought into this, you will see it's a really bad idea. What this does is create a ""cost"" for anyone who wants to leave an extremist group, and a reason for them to stay. Why would someone want to leave a group that loves them, when the other side hates them? 

This is like cult deprogramming 101 and it's very counter intuitive. That is why, you need to only say positive things to former Q's. ""It's a great thing that you've figured it out and have come out of the group. Now we can work together to help America"". And you need to make sure that your recruiting message is as good or better than the cult's recruiting message or you'll never win. 

Also, the idea that anyone can fall for this stuff should be drilled into people's heads. It's not just ""Bad"" people who get suckered into scams and cults. It's the same kind of shaming people do to drug addicts (and Q is very much a social media drug addiction). These cults hijack people's psychology and quirks 

This article explains why people join cults and tactics to get them out. Which is the kind of positive talking that I'm mentioning. And how cults are typically run by self-serving charlatans, but that's not the appeal of them.

1634,Letter for my mom,"I wanted to share this here in case anyone wants to vault off of it in their own messages to loved ones who've gone in deep to the q-ult. I wrote this in my head over the course of late 2019, and 2020. I finally put it in a letter to my mom. Be warned I don't have much hope it will reach her, but I feel it says clearly what I've wanted to say in all this time.  


&gt;I don't really have a solution to this, but I am getting to the basis of my trouble with you and I these days.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is something that I see echoed in our country through many lives. We used to have a difference of opinion. (That's politics.) But I think what you and others are asking of me and people in my ""camp"" is to have different truths.   
&gt;  
&gt;I still believe that truth and lies are an organizing principle that is deeper and beyond belief and opinion. I believe it's what makes dwelling in the same community space possible with people who have differing opinions. Facts are provable, they require evidence, evidence which goes beyond qualitative experience (""I feel"", ""I believe,""  ""I think,"") personal hypotheticals.   
&gt;  
&gt;While science is sometimes wrong or changes over time it has to take hypotheticals and demonstrate that under the same set of conditions the same result will occur, it has to also be validated by many people with direct subject matter expertise. It also is backed up by quantitative data and statistics to show that bias and opinion aren't skewing the result.  
&gt;  
&gt;People who argue alternative facts take the ground we stand on and throw it up for debate. *The earth isn't round because people I know say it isn't.* Never mind the satellite images showing that it is demonstrably round. *Those are deep fakes, as is the holocaust, as is the pandemic, as is the color of the sky.* Essentially you argue no limits to this alternative truth but are imposing that on the rest of us without evidence other than what other ""people are saying.""  
&gt;  
&gt;It didn't use to matter to me what you chose to believe because it wasn't actively harmful to the rest of us. But now that so many of you are trying to govern by these ""alternate"" theories of fact and truth *it is* harmful. A mass of folks tried to overthrow democracy itself based on these opinions.

1635,Irony,"My Q obsessed brother was my idol growing up, the cool older brother who could become friends with anyone in the same room with him. He took care of me when our parents worked long hours. He took care of me when I had my first panic attack and thought I was dying. All with no judgement. We debated EVERYTHING, even as kids. His motto has always been “being open minded isn’t just listening to others, it’s being open to the possibility that you’re wrong.” I find that so full of irony because he has completely lost that ability.

I have actually decided to see my doctor regarding mental health resources for me. Seeing my brother cut off the majority of the family hurt but also let me see the way he is not coping with his obvious mental illness. And at some point it went from focusing on how his mental illness has effected the family to introspection on how my own untreated mental illness has effected my family. I believe both of us are in denial about our mental health and I’m sick of it. I can’t control him and his decisions regarding his mental well-being but I can control mine. 

This is kind of just my ramblings and reminder to any qanon casualties out there to try to stick with your coping skills and stay on top of your mental well-being, because it is so easy for it to get pushed to the side in our fight to get our loved ones back.

1636,I think my aunt's being sucked in?,"Seems flairs aren't allowing for me for some reason, sorry in advance.  


Small context: I (m20) live with my grandmother and her sister (both baby boomers), who I call my aunt but she's really my great aunt. Either way, she's aunt from now on. She's a republican and likes Trump, but I never figured her to be the type to be sucked in by Qanon. She's got a good head on her shoulders otherwise, but as of lately she's been very... conspiracy theory-ish with the stuff she mentions. We used to be able to a bit civil when we discuss politics since we're on 'conflicting' sides before but it's gone downhill, especially leading up to the election and moreso after Biden won.   


I just got shown a video by her of a man listed off almost every state senator/rep (past and present even! John McCain was listed.) that was supposedly involved in a child trafficking ring, and their 'stats' in the ring; kids they killed or otherwise ""violated"" so to say. It was a damn near 6 minute video, and even mentioned that some of the representatives were ""Nazi war criminals"" or apart of the Illuminati. She's been slowly moving towards what I think to be some Qanon conspiracies and they're getting crazier and crazier as time goes on.  


Nearly 3-4 days after Biden's election, she offhandedly pointed out that now that he's elected, there's been more BIPOC on TV about a commercial that's been airing since last year. Now, it's this, among other conspiracies that she didn't seem to fully agree with but didn't seem to be apposed to either like Pizzagate + thinking the Clintons were apart of a child trafficking ring. I don't think she believed in the whole ""Trump would give a signal"" thing though which seems to be the most prevalent. Is this something I should be concerned about? I feel like she's early enough to catch her. What do I do when any time I try to confront her political views, it's met with snarky comments like ""Oh right \[Dusty\], I forgot you knew better than me.""?

1638,"My dad saw the ovens, some of your dads want to build them again","In observance (a day late) of Holocaust Remembrance Day, here is what I posted to a bunch of Facebook friends who mostly don’t realize how serious this QAnon shit is. My sympathies to all of you dealing with the loss of who you thought your families were. And a warning: They are likely to just fall back into the next thing that comes along that might be a good deal more dangerous. Hitler was laughed at, until he wasn’t. He got around 40% of the vote in the last free election held in Germany until the country got pounded into rubble.

First I want to tell you and wanted to tell my FB friends what my dad told me, that he saw the ovens. He saw the living skeletons. He had escaped from Stalag IIB as a prisoner of war and was forced to walk right into a concentration camp because he had to pretend to be bringing his companions into it. Otherwise, he would have been shot as an escapee and I wouldn’t be writing this.

In the camp, he saw the horrors that are now being forgotten and increasingly ignored as generational memory disappears, as fascism resurges in a broken and angry world. They lived on in his traumatized mind for the rest of his life. I got a vivid demonstration of this when we had to leave the line for Space Mountain in Disneyland, because there were people screaming on trains in the dark.

The other thing I said is that probably a third, certainly a fourth, of our fellow citizens could be persuaded to assist with the mass killing of other of our fellow citizens. They have proven this with their deluded and treasonous support for overturning an election, for disregarding the Constitution and the rule of law. They don’t need to come right out and say they’d hold a rifle next to the death pits, though some of the more fanatical ones have made that quite plain. (As you guys know all too well, the QAnon cult was actually looking forward to public executions during the inauguration, in case that little detail escaped your attention.)

I don’t have the energy to fact check you anymore. I don’t have the energy to ask questions anymore. I don’t have the energy to check and make sure your guns are locked up before we bring the kids over, or to explain why I don’t want a CHL, or why I’m not afraid of ANTIFA coming to the suburbs. 

I’m sick of checking your social media. I’m sick of hoping the next failed “prediction” we’ll finally bring you back. I can’t be part of this delusion anymore. I can’t participate in your alternate reality. 

It’s not a difference in beliefs. Your values have changed like your attitude toward life. 

Your rhetoric is angry and paranoid. 

Your tone is accusatory and cruel. 

You’ve all become toxic. 

I know you blame me for breaking up the family. I’ll have to come to grips with the fact that you probably won’t ever see it my way. You'll probably never see or understand that you slipped slowly, then all at once into a cult. I have to abandon my hope for vindication--from your perspective I'll always be the guy. 

But you did this. 

Your decision to abandon reality and reliable sources of information and listen to anonymous people in dark corners of the internet led to your family crumbling. Your refusal to listen to our concerns, and your unbroken chain of gaslighting us led to these boundaries. My kids can’t be in an environment where pedophiles are lurking in the shadows and every institution is aiming to destroy them. 

If someday you wake up and realize the “red pill” you took was actually a delusion that ate up all of your energy for years, or that the moving goal posts of QAnon are bullshit, or that “patriots” were never in control, we can talk. I’d love for you to see your grandkids grow up. But until then, have fun holding the line in your dark, fabricated world of lies.

1650,I'm Trying To Understand," 

This is my first post. I've searched all over for a support group like this and finally heard about it on a podcast the other day.

I'm trying to understand what my mom and sister are up to. Is it a thing that Q supporters keep it under wraps on FB? They are posting stuff that totally sounds like Q conspiracies but they have never said on FB or in real life that they are following it.

They constantly repost articles and videos from the following sites: The New American, Robert David Steele, BitChute, The Blaze, The Epoch Times, Stop World Control, Thru The Looking Glass, The Marshall Report, etc, etc, etc, ad nauseum. Are these sites where Q supporters are gathered?

I guess my question boils down to: how can I know if they are secret Q supporters?

My mom said something to me a couple of months ago that I can't get out of my mind. She asked me if maybe I could agree that Trump is the messiah since he's done so much already for humanity. I laughed at the time, thinking she was joking, but after I heard some things from Q supporters, I'm thinking she was actually just spouting their rhetoric.

I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same situation, of suspecting their family members of being involved in Q or other dark conspiracy groups, but aren't sure.",QAnonCasualties
1651,Could my father be in Q?,"Hello everyone, I’m new to this group but I wanted to make this post to ask for second opinions and see if anyone else thinks my dad could be involved in Qanon. I will start by explaining a bit about our relationship and then laying out all the reasons I think he could be in Q. My dad (50m) and I (20f) have always had a strained relationship ever since my parents divorce, and he often hid things from me and lied about random things. But in the last 5 years it’s really gone off the rails. In 2016, he began spouting some pretty weird stuff about how sandy hook was fake and planned, 911 was planned, CNN was conspiring against Alex Jones and some things like that. Believed all of the conspiracies but never mentioned Q. He also said he “didn’t like Trump” but is very against immigration, felt immigrants stole his job, and thought people like trump because he’s “different” and “honest”. I thought it was odd, and we argued about it, but he didn’t talk about it much again. Him and his wife are very anti-phone and social media, but he is always on his computer and told me he only goes on “non biased new sites and forums”. 

2 years ago, he suddenly vanished. Moved away to another state out of nowhere with his wife and never said goodbye. Missed my graduation. He now lives in the mountains and refuses to send me his address. He just sent a text saying he is sorry. He is now totally separated from our family, practically off the grid and texts me about once every 2 months. I feel like I’ve lost my dad to something crazy and I can’t help but feel like it’s Q...does anyone see any similarities? He lives his life shrouded in mystery now and it scares me. I’m so sad and hate that he is no longer in my life.",QAnonCasualties
1652,"Grandparents far down the rabbit hole, any way to pull them out?","Both of my grandparents are Southern Baptists (my grandfather is a preacher) and have always been pretty conservative, but the last few years things have taken a turn for the worst. Both of them used to listen to Fox News exclusively, up until Fox started criticizing Trump and became ""sellouts"" in their eyes and they turned to Breitbart and other ""news"" outlets. Every conversation with them always ends up somehow coming back to ""dumb AOC"" and ""evil Democrats"" and ""dementia Joe Biden"" and how liberals are the minions of Satan himself and that the Day of Judgement is surely upon us soon.

Grandmother frequently talks about how, the first time she saw Kamala Harris, a chill went up her spine and she ""felt like she was looking into the eyes of the devil,"" saying that God spoke to her directly and told her that Harris was a wolf in sheep's clothing. Grandfather doesn't seem like he can just disagree with anyone anymore - anything left of ""Jesus returning to smite the homosexuals and baby killers and Muslims"" is seen as evil, dumb, and stupid (those words make up about a third of his vocabulary now).

Fortunately my parents aren't as far as my grandparents. Dad's conservative, but he knows that I'm liberal (or at least that I'm more liberal than the rest of my family), and we've been able to have civil conversations about our differences in politics before while maintaining a good relationship. Mom's closer to my grandparents (her parents) than Dad is, also making comments about idiot Democrats and saying that policies she disagrees with are stupid, but even she is able to have civil and rational conversations about other people's different politics. I haven't worked up the nerve to talk back to anyone the way my little brother has, but I worry that if I don't do something soon, my grandparents may be completely beyond saving.

Fortunately I'm usually three hours away at university, but every time I come home I dread having to listen to my grandparents talking and watching their shows right outside my bedroom door (my room is directly connected to their sitting room). I dread every conversation we have as a family because I know it's only a matter of time before they start in on their conspiracies. I'm constantly torn between wanting to get out of their and find my own place far away and also wanting to have a good relationship with everyone. Is there any way I can try to nudge them toward the light? Or are they as good as gone?",QAnonCasualties

1654,I have lost my dad,"Hey guys. I was relieved to discover this community because I have felt so alone in this struggle. 

I'm living at home for one more semester of community college before going to university. 

Within the past two years that I have moved back in with my parents I have noticed a change in my dad. 

He was always my hero. The guy I would rely on for all sorts of advice. We were so similar. 

He received an injury that made it harder for him to be active and with that came this uptick in ""research"". My dad was always into politics, conspiracy theories, and other things of that flavor online.  However, he doesn't have the same kind of media literacy that I do, and started reading blog posts for his information.

He never would go to the doctor, but has become an anti-vaccer. He thinks it caused the autism my brother has. 

He started spiraling. He is up in the morning, looking at his phone. He watches the x22 report and His Glory every single day. These are glorified infomercials and he has fallen for many of them, buying the things that these evil people promote.

The way those people mix Christianity in with their beliefs of the ""great awakening"" that the ""storm is coming"". I can see so clearly that these people are selling snake oil, but my dad doesn't see it this way.

His ideals haven't always meshed with mine. I'm an artsy type and a woman. I have overheard him say over the phone that women are social and have made this country socialist, ""Look what happened when we let them vote."" 

His wish for me was to get married, have kids (and homeschool them) and be a wife to my future husband. Well, I'm a lesbian (have always known I was from age 9).

My dad will send me emails about the conspiracies. In fact, he sent me a text while I was at work from a woman (last name Barnhardt) who thinks that contraception is killing children who would be born and therefore all contraception is evil. I looked at this website further and saw what makes my stomach twist. LGBT people being called sodomites and equated with pedophiles.

I always knew I would never come out to my parents, but this recent event was the final nail on the coffin. I'm biding my time until this semester concludes and I can leave. I am sad because I know I can never come back home, that it isn't safe for my mental health. 

I wish there was a way to save my dad from this conspiracy, but unfortunately the times I have tried are met with his cognitive dissonance and the dogma he has adopted so righteously.

I will always love my dad, but the cult he is in makes it impossible for me to have a relationship with him.

If you are in a similar situation, please tell me about it so I feel less alone. This whole time I have felt so isolated with this deep loss. It's like watching someone you know get taken away and replaced by a stranger until they are unrecognizable.

Edit: a couple other things I want to get off my chest:

My father thinks ANTIFA under disguise were the people who stormed the capital because they have tattoos.

He believes that Trump is the truest President of the United States since Ulysses Grant and not the ""corporation"" of the United States (like Biden is).

His beliefs keep getting worse.",QAnonCasualties
1655,Looking for similarities,"Hey all. So after much much thought, ive come to the realization that I think certain types of people are more susceptible for believing cults or other such things. Its merely an observation/theory. My friend who fell for Q unfortunately had a really rough childhood. Her father left, then he started taking prescription pills and went on a rampage, threatening to kill her mom’s side of the family. It screwed her up. Then her mom struggled financially and was kind of MIA. From what ive observed (and from things shes told me in the past) shes always lacked guidance. We all need guidance. I think that her lack of parental or authoritative guidance has made her a more vulnerable person in general. I dont blame her for this, I sympathize with it. But i guess what im wondering is whether or not your Q person has a similar vulnerability? Perhaps not the same kind by any means, but was your Q person mentally healthy before they fell for all of this? 

Im trying to understand if someone who is “normal” (what is normal anyway) meaning, had a good support system, got educated, had guidance as a child, can fall for this? 

Are we all susceptible to cults, or is there some sort of prerequisite of trauma that is necessary?",QAnonCasualties

Me: Because they're failing and you like conspiracies

**CONTEXT: he is a doomsdayer, was in a Baptist cult that spoke tongues, believes 9/11 was an inside job, lizard people and the Illuminati control the world like every conspiracy theory yet ""hates"" conspiracies.

1658,"My father, on the verge of joining the Qult, has seen the light","Long post, but I am just so unbelievably relieved and wanted to share this as a (slightly) success story. 

My dad, conservative, Evangelical man in his 60s, was and always has been my rock. Growing up he was always there for me, always showed me unconditional love, and always supported me. Until Obama became president and Fox News began to up the ante. My dad despised Obama, not because he was black (so he says), but because he made a statement that “the US is not a Christian country”. He thinks Obama ruined this country for the 8 years he was President, and then along came Trump. In the last four years of Trump, my dad completely changed for the worst.

Everyday it was hours and hours of watching Fox News, listening to the hate and divisiveness they preached, and continuously connected it to Christianity. The first two years, my dads behavior shifted into more anger and hatred, and by the last two years, borderline psychotic. Anything negative about Trump and I was “a brainwashed sheep who is too dumb to understand the demonic Democrats are tricking me” and that “Trump has been persecuted his entire Presidency” and that he is “the best and most Christian president we’ve ever had”. And he believed every word of it. I couldn’t even have a political conversation with him without him losing his shit and screaming at me.

When Biden won, my dad called me and said this country is over, Democrats are cheaters and stole the election, and then proceeded for the next month to continuously post on Facebook how this is “all part of God’s plan and that Trump will be inaugurated again”. At this point not only did I no longer recognize my father, but I started getting scared for his sanity. He was parroting QAnon talking points and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

Much to my shock, last night was the first night in years I had a pleasant, productive, and calm political discussion with my dad. He was able to listen to my viewpoints without yelling or cutting me off, acknowledged that he went a bit overboard, and when I expressed how scared I was for his sanity, he listened and took it all in. What shifted?

He has not turned on Fox News, Newsmax, and OANN as well as has not read anything from them in three weeks. He even admitted to me he’s felt calmer and more relaxed in the last three weeks.

1660,Qanon is a white supremacist cult.,"Qanon is a white supremacist cult. That is a fact. It might make you squirm to think of your siblings, parents or even yourself as being part of a white supremacist cult yet that is the truth. In fact all of qanons core beliefs are built on centuries-old anti-Semitic tropes. These include the alleged existence of a secret society, as well as weaponized false accusations of child-trafficking and murder. 



You may believe that because they welcome POC to an extent, they are not inherently a white supremacist cult, that is wrong. They are a white supremacist cult who is accepting to POC provided they behave in accordance with cult ideals and oppose Jewish people vehemently enough. It may be difficult to begin to perceive them in this way, but everytime qanon references the cabal, lizard people, (((them))), or ""the question,"" they are talking about Jews. This does not change if you are a POC.



Many of these harmful tropes started in the middle ages, (a good place to start if anyone is sincerely interested in the history of modern antisemitism) these tropes alleged that Jews were responsible for kidnapping Christian children and drinking their blood for religious rituals. Those claims, called blood-libel conspiracy theories, persisted throughout the 1800s and into the 20th century. The blood-libel conspiracy is alive and well in qanon. It has been updated for the modern mind and now includes a fictional reptilian, deep-state cabal consuming the blood of children through adrenochrome.



The lizard people thing is weird but makes a lot of sense. What better way to dehumanize your enemies than to literally dehumanize them? The language is so telling. I choose to believe exactly what they say: that they feel they are surrounded by people who are not real humans. This delusion is very, very real to some of them.



All of this makes some kind of horrible sense. Afterall, Qanon makes societal collapse fun! Its exciting!! The rest of the sheep will go bleating into the night as they align themselves with the pedophile cabal, but you have discovered the truth. You decode the qdrops. You are in control. You are fighting the bad guys with friends. Of course Qultists feel this way. Qnanon is basically an ARG.



So what do we do about this and when will it end? I don't know. A part of me is afraid it won't be over until there is a mass tragedy similar to Jones Town. The USA was not prepared for a mental health crisis and of this magnitude. It will be interesting to see if they are able to handle a mass deprogramming.



There are resources that have helped me greatly in my journey. Here are a few books and subjects to look into:



Combating Cult Mind Control by Steve Hassan.
This is such an important book for understanding the psychology of mind control cults and fortifying yourself again it. Steve Hassan is an excultist and a an excellent resource for all things mind control and reprogramming related. There are multiple chapters written for loved ones of people in cults which gives invaluable advice.


Why Does He Do That? By Lundy Bancroft. This is legitimately one of the most important books I have ever read. It is about the psychology of intimate partner abuse, but I have found infinite parallels in the abusive techniques of organizations and societal norms. We live in a fundamentally abusive system. Is it any wonder that qultists are seeking an explanation for the abusive nature of society?


White Rage by Carol Anderson. This book chronicles the history of white supremacy in the USA. I believe this should be mandatory reading for all US citizens. It unapologetically and succinctly details the history and psychology of racially motivated rage.",QAnonCasualties

1665,Evangelicals sowed the seeds of QAnon,"A significant portion of my extended family has bought into the QAnon madness. Thankfully, neither of parents were so hateful or delusional, but so many others showed their true selves. They were primed for buying into the insanity of Q, because of the last hundred years of Evangelical dogma. 

Ever since scientists determined that life is derived from Evolution by Natural Selection, Evangelicals have been pushing conspiracy theories. They have claimed that millions of scientists in diverse fields over generations have conspired to hide the ""Truth"" about biology in order to undermine the Bible. They are so convinced that a naïve reading of the text tells them everything that they need to know that they were comfortable diving headfirst into conspiracy thinking. 

This was steadily expanded on over the years with claims about government environmental regulation being part of scientist conspiracy to stifle businesses. Or claims that attempts to make healthcare available to everyone are a conspiracy to destroy the healthcare system. Or more recently conspiracies about vaccines being dangerous or causing autism or something else. It all comes from the same impulse to treat anything that a scientists says as suspect, but anything their pastor/führer says as authoritative. They have already decided what must be true, and they are determined to interpret everything else from that position.

1683,“Follow up” on prior post.,"I posted previously how I ‘thought’ I had lost my mom, &amp; that I just didn’t know what to do, but I now?  I am fully convinced she is gone. I’ve lost her. 

I mentioned previously that I wasn’t raised with a conservative upbringing that I recall, in fact, I feel like my passion for equality &amp; helping everyone came directly from my mom. I think this is part of the reason that this whole thing feels so hurtful &amp; confusing. How could she change so much? Where did this happen? Should I have spent more time w/her so she wasn’t lonely?  My parents divorced when I was very young &amp;  she has no current s/o. Should I have known this would happen &amp; try to help her be more introverted so she was exposed to others more? 

Tuesday night we had a full blown, hour + argument. I will be the 1st to admit that I didn’t handle the situation the best.  I did anything BUT stay calm &amp; rational. There was yelling. A lot of it, on both sides &amp; I’m reeling w/my own behavior &amp; actions atm, but regardless, I know I’ve lost her for real.  It started out casual, but escalated quickly. 

I’ve been up since 2:30, bc I keep replaying our argument over &amp; over in my head. I’m usually  emotionally in touch but I’m struggling to figure out what I’m feeling. I haven’t shed a single tear - and that alone makes me feel sad. 

I keep asking myself, Where did I go wrong? Why didn’t I stay calm? Who is this woman that I was engaging with? I knew this was coming &amp; felt prepared, but in the moment I lost my cool. 

She’s always been into conspiracies for as long as I remember, but never fully committed to them being 100% truth. She was always open to religion &amp; seeking out different beliefs, but as her devout Christianity increased, so has her belief in a world of good v evil, right v wrong, Black/white thinking. 

Ofc AOC/Sanders are evil, Trump was “anointed by God to save us from the evils of the Cabal” &amp; “I’m not prepared for what is coming and if I don’t wake up I will perish w/the rest of “them”.  This hurt. Clearly she was unable to separate ME - her own daughter, from the likes of “them” (the evil, God hating Dems, liberals, progressives etc). 

 I’m feeling so many feels, grief, sadness, confusion, guilt etc. The hardest part for me is figuring out, what now? I can’t just act like this argument didn’t occur? I can’t just ignore this &amp; “fake it” around her...but then my heart starts pounding at the thought of cutting her out of my life. It’s my mom. The one who, even as an adult, I’ve cried to, and cried for during major moments in life. She’s the mom who taught me to fight and stand up for what’s right - to make sure that everyone is treated equally. She’s the single mom who worked her ass off when my dad wasn’t involved for years to provide for us, who taught me residency, the value of a dollar, who LAID MY MORAL BASELINE. 
Yet. We are somehow here. 

Where do I go from here. I talked to my husband and for now, I’m just going to sit in it. Let the emotions calm down. I don’t want to make any irrational decisions, but in my heart of hearts, I feel like the choice is inevitable. 

If you’ve had experiences similar to this- what did you do?
 Do you think you’ll ever reach out to them again? 

I’ve read so many articles saying to try and reach out, that it will take time, be open &amp; make them feel their voices are heard &amp; they are safe so that way they can reconnect with you &amp; maybe pull out of this. 

I just feel like this is a bigger task than I am able to do. It’s not that my mom isn’t “worth it”, ...maybe it is me? Maybe I’m NOT open minded? But how am I supposed to sit down calmly &amp; make her feel she is safe w/me when she is  spouting off this harmful, illogical rhetoric that makes me sick to my stomach? 

I apologize for the novel. Like I said, I’ve been up since 2:30 &amp; I didn’t know where else to go. So I came here.",QAnonCasualties
1684,"Should you reach out to Qanon ""believers""?","Hi all,

NB: I'm not from the States but I'm following the whole Qanon debacle pretty close. Watching documentaries, talking with some psychology experts, reading articles and listening to podcasts. Btw, this sub appeared on a podcast recently but I can't recall which one, Reply all maybe? I'm browsing this sub for a couple of months now reading the most upvoted posts and I'm scared, confused, and angry. But to meritum.

 This topic is really interesting from an academic POV, to see why so many people start to follow some bogus conspiracy theories and how they blindly follow an anonymous account (that is most probably controlled by a malicious actor)

I recently read this article [No, I Will Not Be ‘Reaching Out’ To Trump Voters, Now Or Ever. Here’s Why.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reaching-out-to-trump-voters-unity_n_5fad1d45c5b6d647a39c46a2) and I agree wholeheartedly. I draw some parallels with the ongoing climate collapse and the Qanon stuff.

*Sidenote: For over 10 years I was a person that was very active in different organizations trying to persuade the general populace that we are heading into a climate apocalypse and that we must act now. Nothing changed, it just worsened and at one point I just laid arms, and right now I'm enjoying the ride. If you wish to know how I felt before [The Climate Crisis Is Worse Than You Can Imagine. Here’s What Happens If You Try.](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-climate-crisis-is-worse-than-you-can-imagine-heres-what-happens-if-you-try) and [The Emotional Toll of Climate Change on Science Professionals](https://eos.org/features/the-emotional-toll-of-climate-change-on-science-professionals). Right now when I read about companies going or promoting ""green"" or how people are dumbfounded that there are wildfires or flashfloods I just smirk. typical case of Cassandrafreude -  the bitter pleasure of things going wrong in exactly the way you predicted, but no one believed you when it could have made a difference. A portmanteau of Cassandra, the mythological Trojan princess, and schadenfreude, a German word meaning deriving pleasure from someone else's pain.*

So after reading the article how the author of the article will not be reaching out to the Trump supporters I had flashbacks to ""I will not reach out to climate deniers"" and also to Qanon.

Let me ask you this question - Should you, will you, and why reach out to Qanons? Slowly this entire mascarade is falling down and people may start to realize that they were wrong to follow Q. Should you reach out to them? In my opinion (of someone that became very cynic and bitter) - no. They should be ""online"" branded and made fun of. I don't care if this creates a rift - they certainly didn't reach out to all of you. They made fun of the Holocaust, of BLM and even stormed the Capitol. Why do you need to always go high? [The Alt-Right Playbook: You Go High, We Go Low](https://youtu.be/MAbab8aP4_A) and [Sometimes I Wish the Obamas Wouldn’t ‘Go High’](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/problem-when-they-go-low-we-go-high/577543/)

I know also about this concept of forgiving your oppressor [Forgiveness: Letting go of grudges and bitterness](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/forgiveness/art-20047692). But let's be clear, the moment you forgive, in their eyes, you are the weak one to be used again and again.",QAnonCasualties

I feel this is especially important now that Q is a problem in many other countries apart from the US and the Qdrops aren't happening anymore... there isnt a leader to Q now and countries are having different narratives that are all aligning with the extreme right parties. They are following real people w real political power now, that dont talk abt Q necessarily but use Qs narratives and tactics.

Should we change our responses once a Qperson is no longer 'simply' a member of an alt-right cult but part of the extreme right? Where do we draw the line? When they go to one of those rallies or meetings? When they vote for one of those parties? When they say something sexist or racist or homophobic? When they are violent?

some time around the end of 2016 i met this really awesome chick, who was super chill and seemed to be a down to earth person, we got talking and ended up being an on and off again fling, see eachother for a few months, then go do our own thing, we both had jobs that caused us to travel away from home for extended times, and anytime we were both in town, we pretty much spent our time together.

around july 2020 we had started talking again, one night after... ya know... we were laying there talking and she started going on about politics, and i let her go on, she gave me the whole run down about Q, afterwards, i was like meh whatever. i smoke pot, i hang out with pot heads, im used to wild crack pot theories being thrown around, i didnt think too much of it.

over the next few weeks of us hanging out, i started to notice she wasnt the same chick i remembered, like there was a definite switch in her personality, we would be in the middle of watching a tv show, id be on the xbox, ya know whatever, shed get a tweet saying trump was talking on live, and the whole world had to stop. she had to see what he'd say. she would make me switch the TV over to a livestream of trump.

i supported the president sure, but like id catch what he said in a youtube video the next day, ive never obsessed over politics like its the whole world. this happened like 5 times and shed start pointing out things like ""the color of his tie, it means this"" or ""did you hear the phrase he just used, theres a deeper meaning to that"". i ended up telling her i couldn't see her anymore, and told her i was pretty sure she was getting involved with a cult. Citing this whole ""where we go one goes"" shit, or whatever they say, as a mantra typically used in the brainwashing of cults.

1692,A complex situation: The Cult Sandwich.,"Admittedly, I'm afraid making this -- texting this up on my phone at 3:21 AM (even if I'm laying in bed, trapped in my thoughts alone). **This is not a rant against main-stream beliefs**. Rather, this is my life's experience of how my family changed towards radical political belief. 



When one grows up in a 'Good Christian' Home, being a single child to two very devout parents -- parents who would do the right thing for the sake of their kid; how could something evolve? Time I found has always been The Unstoppable Catalyst. 

I grew up in a protestant faith -- practically living at the church I went to. A church that I would be at for at least Eight Hours per Day, and that's not including public school (which, looking back, thank goodness I went to public school). My family had The American Dream: Parents with a house; both have cars; both have high-paying employment; and a son that believed in their faith. Military presence in my family has been always relevant, from my father to my father's father -- I could go down the line with this stuff, but not me.

I was denied that -- once seen -- prestige I craved: to fulfill the familial tradition. We are all born differently, and I've accepted that. Soon after, my family developed splits in religion, somewhere around 2011. From Baptists to Catholicism, I followed my folks to make them proud like the acolyte I was. That's all I ever wanted was to make my family proud. We went through their process -- and I was a teen at the time, but in small-town communities, religion tied close. 

Now, this is where things grow complex: Married Couple who have been separated for 10 years now. Separated by quite the distant now. Internal affairs that left marks on both of them, and it shows that they both are victims still from wounds that have not healed from the decades they have been alive. This is where I feel like this ended up to be my fault, but I know that I'm just putting self-blame for something that was out of my control, and rightly so. I showed my Mother social media. I thought that maybe she could reach out to harmless groups and tie into things that would help her coop with her issues. 

Helped do the same for my Father. It fueled their separation from not just each other, but from grounded reality. At first, it seemed quite promising. They found themselves following their respective churches and maybe watching some innocent YouTube Videos -- unboxings and cooking shows; well-natured content. Then a paradigm shift began. It started with Queen of Peace Media. Then it evolved by the Children of Medjugorje. I didn't think much of it based on the small clips I saw at the time, just ""Catholicism stuff, or whatever"" I thought to myself. 

That was two years ago. Ignorance I now see as a precious commodity today. Following the teachings of Seers and Priests who have shown severe intolerance. So much to a point to where The Vatican (The debatble capital of Catholicism) was now seen as ""already lost to The Anti-Christ"". They began preaching the vatican as a lie; a very hot topic for sure, but the point is they essentially denounced their faith to such a rapid degree. Then the preaching about the 3-Days of Darkness began as the cult's prophecy started pouring fear into my family's hearts. 

Paranoia of a religious degree was taking hold; I kept true to myself, and my faith was more-or-less shattered after my last job. That was two years ago. Covid hit, and my folks saw it as a religious sign to Dig Deep into their personal faiths. Then, the Q hit. A combination of bias news, cult news, conspiracy theories, and over-all paranoia and mental illness grew. I myself having a compromised immune system, I had to quit my job once the risk got high enough at hospitals. I was a liability and the best thing I can do is stay home. 

Now, being stuck at home, where a shattered economy makes it nigh impossible to live alone, I suffer. I try my best to be supportive, but the rhetoric that is preached every day makes me want to throw up. I get physically ill from it. I never even said a word about it, but my folks began to cry at the sheer thought of me getting a Covid Vaccine. Their Anti-Vaxx belief is cemented. To them, the ""Demon-crats"" (they state) will continue their 'ritualistic unholy sacrifices for their pagan God' for now. They still firmly believe, even after Joe Biden had been inaugurated, that Trump will win. 

Excuse: ""Trump moved the inaguration date to March 6th, as was the old tradition"". Caught into a rediculously large sum of daily lies by the former-president, my folks believe he was put into office not by The People, but by Jesus and God himself. They believe everything he says for two main reasons they fall back onto when I provide factual citation of falsehoods and wrong-doings: He is Pro-Life and publicly proclaimed God in a good light. Both also arguable, but I refrain.

They refuse counseling; they refuse their old faith; they refuse their community; and they are refusing me. I constantly get insults sent my way, and their psychological aggression about their political belief. That I'm just ""A naive millennial who knows nothing about The Big Picture"". Even hearing them say ""Sheeple"" under their breath when I object towards anything absurd. I never suspected such disrespect and immature nature coming from those I know, let alone my own parents. 

**I'm lost.**

I'm not sure what I can do besides weather Covid out  so I can find a job to leave. I want to help, but maybe the only way I can is to leave -- I feel like that is my only choice.

I love my parents -- my family. I just don't know if I can stomach the Proud Boys, Qanon, and Children of Medjugorje for much longer than the years I have already.",QAnonCasualties

1694,My best friend of 16 years is a Trump supporter.,"Okay, so, I don't really know where to start since they're not a hard Q follower, nor was there any obvious shift in mentality. They're not a very political person at all, and tells me repeatedly that they don't like talking about it. I do open political discussions with them somewhat often, because I find it important to know where they stand on things and for them to know where I'm standing too. I've tried poking factual holes in their reasoning for a few years, but maybe I'm too rough with it. My dad can get through to them though, to plant those seeds of doubt.

My fear is that their parents are Q people. They are stuck at home with them due to CoVid. They don't really watch the news either, so their main source of info is probably the parents. We weren't old enough to vote in 2016, so they probably just went with whatever their parents did.

It hurts to watch such a beautiful, gentle soul support such a narcissistic spoiled brat.

However, I'm not going to stop being their friend. Part of the problem here in America is not having civil discussions with people whose views are completely opposite of yours. I'm not going to add to that problem by ending a friendship that's lasted for so long. We still can have great conversations and enjoy our time together. It shouldn't be a us vs them mentality.

I was appalled and shock and ask myself when did this happen how could she let herself get into this. I messaged her and asked how she was and she said she was fine. She has 3 kids I don’t want her to expose them to this. I want to have a talk with her and ask her what happened to her. I don’t want to lose the friendship I have with her.,QAnonCasualties
1708,My dad and brother won't give up Qanon..,"My brother and my dad have been deep into Qanon -- it's crazy the mental gymnastics they play.  

The last 90 days have been interesting, as it got much worse after Nov 3rd... they have been busy decoding messages from 4chan aka ""Q drops"". 

This is kind of a timeline of what they've been telling me, post the election results.

1) AG Barr will release all the evidence of the deep state players... Barr quits.. now Barr is deep state and part of the swamp. 

2) Trump's lawyer's have all the evidence and will overturn the election. They lose all lawsuits.

3) Just wait, the SCOUTS is in play, and will overturn the election.. doesn't happen.

4) Trump will enact the insurrection act, and over turn the election. Doesn't happen.

5) Just wait, on January 6th, Pence will over turn the election. He doesn't.
Now Pence is a traitor and will soon be arrested. Trump will enact martial law and there will be 10 days of darkness between Jan 10th and 20th. Doesn't happen... 

6) They're going to snare a trap on Jan 20th, this is why the military is there.
 They will take control, and arrest everybody (Swearing up and down Biden won't be inaugurated) Biden gets inaugurated... 

7) The inauguration was fake and pre taped though... 

8) Trump is still in control, March 4th, the deep state will be arrested and Trump be sworn in.. 

Everytime their Qanon stuff doesn't playout, they change the narrative.. and move the goalposts.

My dad says, Biden was sworn in as the president of the united states, the corporation, not the United States of America.. 

They have no sense of reality. 

Their questions like ""why is the military in DC"" why was Biden sworn in at 11:43Am EST and not noon, why did Biden fly to the inauguration via private jet, not a government aircraft?"" I explained using Occam's Razor.. the most reasonable, simplest answer is generally the only right answer..

I gave reasonable explanations, and they immediately deny it, followed by ""just wait"" 

How the fuck, do I break fown their cognitive dissonance...??

1712,It hurts to watch your heroes fall,"Growing up I was raised in a extreme right wing household and family gathering. I never realized what was wrong in the world. I loved my family and thought that being conservative was a no brainer. When I was younger my father and mother would openly hate Obama. It’s the duty of the people to criticize public servants. But to hate based on skin color and make fun of their children and wife...that’s disgusting and inexcusably evil. But as a kid, I didn’t know any better. Thankfully I’m an adult now who has changed my ways, but I still feel disgusted in myself for believing that it’s okay to thrive off hate. It had gotten to the point where I asked as a kid “what would happen if I voted for Obama”. His response would be “you’d sleep outside and you wouldn’t be my son anymore”

Flash forward to today. According to my parents: Black Lives Matter is a terrorist group that wants division, Joe Biden is going to start a civil war, COVID vaccine is a mind control device that will get us to get in line, the COVID vaccine is going to give your children autism and spinal defects, and he’s bought overly excessive amounts of ammunition for the sole purpose of (if things go the way they are going and the government cracks down)

THEY WORK IN THE MEDICAL FIELD

My father quits facebook to join Parler and qanon. Because “free speech is being banned”. They’re both lost, they both thrive off of hate and conspiracy to the point where I can’t stand being around them. 

My father posted that trumps defeat gave him the same feeling if not worse then watching his two sons play their final football games. That aoc, Pelosi, sanders, are all demons that the Bible Warned them of. 

It just hurts to see the ones you were raised by that you looked up to fall and give into hatred so easily. It hurts so god damn bad and I cannot do anything. Not even if I tried to reach out to them. 

Luckily I am blessed to have an insanely supportive girlfriend who has similar problems with her family. She suggests loving them at a distance, which may need to happen. It drains my mental energy and overall mental health to even deal with them or see it unfold before my eyes.

Anybody else who has it similar just know you aren’t alone. It hurts, bad. And I’m sorry. Just know myself and others feel it too.

1714,Starting at the Tippy Top - ending Q,"In order for there to be a catharsis and a reversal for a lot of the damage “Q” has done I am posing a few questions and need some advice/insight from those of you who may be well qualified in the technology and legal aspects of if this would be possible. And what your opinions are along with an open discussion on this. 

1. Does anyone else think that the government should find whoever started Q (the actual people/person) and charge them with crimes and force them to publicly explain what they were doing? If people could really see the face of Q with the curtain pulled all the way back, maybe it would make the facade fall away faster. There must be some way to track the IP address of whoever made the Q posts on those 4chan or 8chan posts? There must be some digital trail back to who is really Q? 

2. Seeing as whoever started Q is technically practicing free speech but this free speech led people to commit random crimes by people who were brainwashed: could the person (or people) who started Q be charged with any crimes? In a legal sense I guess the question is are the people who started Q liable for all of the pain and suffering everyone here is experiencing. 

My opinion is that the best way to fold Q would be starting at the tippy top of the Q pyramid. Bring Q out from behind the screen and let everyone who believes see who he (or they) really are, and hold them accountable. 

I look forward to thoughts/insights/discussion on this.",QAnonCasualties
1715,Putin = good??,"I was hoping that after the election, my Qmom would be one of the people to jump ship. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. But today she made the claim that Putin is also fighting the cabal for his people the same way trump did. She said that we've been told a lot of lies about him and that it's the mainstream media that demonizes him. I should've seen it coming, but hearing that he's a good guy fighting for his people definitely caught me off guard. 

Immediately after, I found out about Alexei Navalny ([Putin oppositionist that was poisoned and arrested](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/17/957821537/kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-detained-after-returning-to-russia-following-poiso)) and that whole situation going on currently. Of course I brought that up to my mom and how the people that Putin is supposedly fighting for are protesting. Still waiting to see how she'll spin it to fit her narrative.

I don't know what to do anymore and I'm starting to lose hope. My brother and I have been trying to counter her for months to no avail. We've tried facts, debunking her theories, trying to cast doubt over the whole q movement, but she always dodges it and regurgitates something else she's been fed by q.

1718,Another story becoming hate,"I’m writing here because I have a friend. We’ll call him J. 

I’ve been a friend of J’s since high school, almost 20 years ago. J’s one of those friends that is the lynchpin of a good time. A classic hype man. In high school he struggled a little bit with purpose but he was an aspiring novelist and filmmaker with tons of creativity. We played video games, reenacted WWE stupidity, went to the midnight showing of Matrix sequels, and just generally had an awesome friend group of which J was the loadstone. He’s a great guy. 

I was a year ahead of him and graduated and went off to college. He joined the military but we stayed in contact over the years. He’d come to visit, we’d go on hikes, reminisce about old times, we played WoW together for awhile because we’re both nerds and because it was a great way to stay connected. He ended up finishing his time in the military and took his GI Bill to go to film school. 

It was a bit of a struggle but he finished his degree, I was really excited to see what scripts and content he would find to do next. 

Unfortunately, afterward, he never found a great job. I’m skipping details, of course, but I want to provide the broad strokes for context. 

These days he’s living off military disability. 

But the story picks up around 2017 when J was traveling the world on a shoestring budget to find his next thing. He was really out there in a good way. But then, he ended up in one country, got some money stolen, and discovered Q online. He rushed home, convinced that all of Hollywood was about to be rounded up and job opportunities would abound. 

The story from here is predictable from these forums. He was utterly convinced of a lot of things. And those have kept changing as they didn’t happen. The midterms would be a landslide, arrests would abound, the election was stolen and Trump would be installed. He made commitments that if x or y didn’t happen then Q was all a lie. 

Now we come to today. Q is still real to him. We’re just being tricked, etc.

This is where I’m getting concerned. Lately his conversations have gotten really angry. He’s currently acting really intense about transgender people. Acting like the world is being utterly destroyed by executive orders. Nothing I say helps, it just drives him deeper. And, honestly, I’m getting concerned. I’ve read stories about people being radicalized into terrorists over far less, and that they’re being recruited from people just like J. 

But. What am I supposed to do? I don’t think he’s a violent person at all. And, even if somehow the authorities were right to help (which I doubt), I can only imagine the permanent affect of having the Feds show up, convincing him for the rest of his life of the conspiracies.",QAnonCasualties

He was on an important call in the kitchen, at 7 pm, and I got home from work (which I go to directly from college). I’ve been working a lot to save up to leave. I made a tiny bit of noise so after the call he screamed at me for it. I asked why couldn’t he take a call in his home office instead because I had not ate since 11. He responded by charging at me, taking my boiling water from the stove and dumping my food down the drain. He almost got me and my dog with the boiling water because he let it splash everywhere. Then he took the box of noodles and punched it across the kitchen, where it went everywhere. I started crying and he screamed at me for crying, calling me dramatic, and made me pick up every mini mac and cheese shell. I told him I only had twenty minutes and to make food and eat it, because I was going to babysit for more money. He then screamed at me more, saying that if I keep working more hours, he is going to put my dog down. My dog is 16, diabetic, and only alive because I pour my heart and soul into keeping him healthy. I’m planning on leaving in august but I’m getting so scared. My mom called me dramatic for “crying like a baby”. He used to be such a good dad; Q has turned him into this. He still believes everything Q says is going to happen, still thinks Trump is going to come back. I never disagree with him verbally anymore because I get scared. I’m sorry this is so long, I have posts in this subreddit about the Q stuff before. Many people were very kind to me and I want to see if any of you have experienced something like this. Before anyone says to leave right now, I don’t have a lot of money (under 2k), but my car is worth $26000 if I had to come to that. I’m also recovering from a very intense surgery. I appreciate you for reading this!

Edit: I just got home from babysitting. He “apologized” and said he should not have gotten “so worked up”. But then he turned it back at me saying that I should have attitude (by that, he means my asking why he did not take the call in his office, I had no mean tone or anything because I’m scared to have one!). He then said “it was unbecoming for both of us” ???????? What????. I told him I was scared of him and I thought he was going to hurt me. He laughed and said “no! Why would I ever do that!” And then I said “you did it to (my brother)”. He said it was different because he is a boy. 

This apology was not sincere and I am still scared of him hurting me one day. At least when I went to babysit I got to play with their puppy which made me feel better :), small wins!",QAnonCasualties

1726,It's like a veil was lifted,"For the past few years, I'd like to say around June 2018, I dove deep into the Conspiracy Theory rabbit hole; it started with ""hip-hop/celebrity Illuminati symbolism"" videos, and eventually led me to pizzagate. I even remember the video that I watched, it was titled ""Pizzagate and Beyond,"" not sure if it's still up on YouTube or not.

After going down that rabbit hole, I was eventually led back to 4chan for the first time since I was 11 years old (that was a whole 7 years without going there,) and I was almost instantly hooked. I spent the entire night scrolling through conspiracy threads, and that is where I was introduced to Q - and for 2 years since then, I was a hardcore QOOMER.

I would say that it was one of the most miserable and emotionally draining periods in my life; I'm not usually one to be affected by a lot of stuff, but things that I was reading and seeing how much we've been ""lied to"" made me feel so fucking bad - whatever I did, I couldn't shake this feeling. It wasn't depression, I'm mentally sound, surprisingly (lol) but I can admit that it felt like a huge weight had been dumped onto my consciousness. I went from happy and hopeful, becoming interested in meditation and spirituality, to feeling down and losing interest in everything around me. That had to be the turning point, you would think... but I still kept going down this rabbit hole and it consumed almost all of my time. Day in and day out, I would constantly check 4chan for the next ""HAPPENING"" and hope that these corrupt politicians have finally been apprehended. That continued up until Biden was inaugurated. I would even try to ""redpill"" my friends on a lot of this stuff, which I kinda regret because it's fucking embarrassing now that I look back at it, but I'm also glad to have experienced this stuff, as I've learned how easy it is to get sucked into these things.

A few days after Biden's inauguration, it's like I snapped out of this mindset and realized that it was a farce the entire time; Trump wasn't going to arrest these people, Q wasn't going to swoop in and save the day, and there was no PLAN to have justice served. Nothing really happened that caused me to snap out of it, though; I just did, and I'm sort of glad that I no longer really give a shit about Trump or these conspiracy theories.

I know this is contradictory to what I have written above, but I still do believe that there is *some* truth to conspiracy theories; not so much Q, but I do 100% believe that there are a lot of corrupt people in high places trying to control things; I also believe that secret societies do exist. The only difference now is that I don't really give a shit, I don't care to research it or delve down rabbit holes; I just wanna go back to how I was before. I also thought I'd add that I am usually really apprehensive and suspicious of what I read and things I hear about, which is pretty funny considering how long I believed in the Q shit.

I'm losing my dad to far right-wing conspiracies.

I'm 17 years old and I don't live with my dad, however I maintain contact with him through text message (we don't see each other in person much).

Ever since 2016, my dad has been an avid Trump supporter. He is literally Mexican but he agrees with Trump's racist rhetoric (when he's not calling everything fake news). He hates all Democrats. He thinks Joe Biden is controlled by communists. He believes the election was definitely stolen. He has read Ted Cruz's book and plans on buying Josh Hawley's book soon. He refers to ""BLM/ANTIFA"" as terrorists. He loves Matt Gatez. He doesn't even watch Fox News anymore (it's fake news now)—he's onto Newsmax.

This is a text he sent me YESTERDAY:

""Trump will go down as the best one-term President in the history of the United States. I cannot wait until these RINO congressman lose their job next year. Can’t wait.""

Everyday I try to tell him the truth, sending sources and everything, but nothing gets through. He is still going on about it. It's actually so sad seeing my dad go down this path.

The other day I asked him if he knew what Qanon was and he said ""I don't know about Q please educate me."" I explained it to him but he just ignored my texts and went on to the next topic.

Ahhh. I don't know what to do. I love my dad so much but his politics are completely upside down. I'm afraid it might get worse. I don't think he's that out of touch with reality to get into Qanon but I really don't know anymore.",QAnonCasualties

1736,Not sure what to do about my father anymore.,"TLDR: My dad has gone off the deep end and feels the need to “save” people by getting them to see the way, and I don’t want to abandon my mother who refuses to leave him.


Flashback to 2014, I’m getting divorced and my father doesn’t approve and he writes me a series of letters about how it is against gods laws, etc. This starts a rift between us and I decide to just leave it be for a while, until my girlfriend friends him on Facebook and I start to see what he is posting and sharing. I refuse to stand by and let me father spew hate online without some one to call him on his bigotry.


Then trump takes office and his rhetoric shifts from just racist and sexist toward the Q crap, save the children is what got him, being a good catholic and all. He just keeps amping up with how trump is the savior America has been waiting for and all the other conspiracies, meanwhile claiming not to believe “all” of the information he spews online but never clarifying what he would object to. 


Then we get to election time and the “evidence” of how it will be rigged and stolen. This continues until I guess I struck a nerve and he blocks me and most of the family from his profile. Biden wins and then the stop the steal chant starts as well as a fair well post from Facebook (I created a fake profile to see what he was posting) about the death of America and how we now bow to our Chinese socialist masters. I wish it ended there.


He continued his mission to “save” me, sending me links to “censored” videos about how trump will be back and America’s enemies are happy Biden is in office. I do not engage with them, because any logical argument is met with insults and deflection, I guess I can’t see the big picture. 


But then my 6yo niece, who my mom and dad take care of 2-3 days a week, at a birthday dinner says “we can’t celebrate Chinese New Year because they make the virus.” My sister and her husband are shocked and try to make it a teachable moment. Of course there was a video he sent to me a few weeks before about China making the virus to destroy us. So I take the time to respond to one of the latest emails with questions about what he believes and all I get back is deflection and how Q isn’t dangerous.


I love my mom and want to make sure she is safe, she told me how she is treated at home and while none of it is physically harmful it is emotional abuse. She isn’t allowed to sleep in, she has to dress nicely every day, etc. She’s told me she doesn’t like it but won’t stand up to him. She was the breadwinner for the house, corporate job, retirement savings, health insurance. My dad worked and did ok but he also quit the best job he had because the owner was an atheist. My mom, during a recent vacation we took (dad refuses to travel), asked if she should leave him but didn’t know if she could because she was afraid of what he would do if she left, I told her it want my place to tell her to leave. 


If you’ve made it this far, thanks for listening this really doesn’t scratch the surface of what’s going on but I just needed to get it out. If anyone has any advice, tips, similar stories with even small successes I could use it. I don’t want to abandon my family but my father has turned toxic.",QAnonCasualties

My doctor said I was lucky that I didn't have an episode for the two weeks I was off my meds, and now that I'm back on my meds, I'm gonna start getting my life back in order. 

However, I came to a sickening realization when I picked up my prescription. I'm celebrating getting my medicine, which I need to survive, because it's my little way of rebelling against Mom and her conspiracies. She's been so adamant about there being some national crisis (apart from the pandemic) that she won't let me go outside, and in getting my medicine, in getting pills that I need to survive, I've told Mom that I have a life outside her QAnon qult.

He bet me $2k to my $1k that Trump would win election a year ago. Well he didn't... after the election was called, he wouldn't pay b/c it 'wasn't over'. He was never more confident of anything in his life he said. So he doubled the bet. 

I get my $4k tomorrow. 

He asked if Biden is removed for an illegal election if he gets his money back. There are no bets anymore w/out recourse. I said in the next 100 days if yes, I owe him $4k if not, he owes me. He's not into 'picking dates' anymore.

I did ask her not to send them but recently one came my way and I took the step of sending her an email essentially breaking up with her as a friend.  While we do have a lot of history, she is a completely different person now and I can't have a civil conversation with her because she actually refuses to talk about other subjects.  Q and the related conspiracies is all she says is worth discussing currently.  Well, that was it or me.  The combination of her arrogant behavior, belittling my trying to be civil with her (I asked if we could talk about other things and she claims ""that would be a very superficial conversation, there is nothing else worth talking about now"") and just plain not wanting to have this type of thinking in my life has made me feel the need to cut her off.  I do hope one day she will come to her senses and in that case I would gladly talk to her again but I doubt it.  I sent her an email which was flagged undeliverable, I assume she has blocked me because I don't support her views.  I then attempted to send her a text which I don't know if she received as I felt the need for some type of closure because she is someone I valued as a friend.

It's been sad and painful to let go of this person and I really feel for those who have had to do this with family members!  This is not easy to navigate.",QAnonCasualties

1744,Here’s the thing I don’t get. Shouldn’t Qanon folks be happy it wasn’t true. If it was that means there would have been a violent overthrow of the democracy by the military. When that happens in other countries we know it’s the start of human rights abuses &amp; at best civil war.,"I have a hard time understanding the disappointment of QAnon devotees that “ The Storm ™️” didn’t happen. If they’d been right it would have signified the military wrestling power out of the hands of the “ We the people” that they can’t seem to shut the fuck up about. In other countries when the military seizes power from the elected government we all understand that , that is the beginning of the end of human rights in that country. How do these “freedom” obsessed “ muh free speech” idiots not get that if Trump had pulled it off ( and even though it wasn’t done by the military one can’t say that he wasn’t desperately trying to overturn a legitimate election violently in order to retain power ) so if Trump had pulled it off. He’d have made saying something critical or negative about him an illegal act. This is a guy who calls any news he doesn’t like fake &amp; has talked obsessively about imprisoning &amp; calling for violence upon people that criticize him. How are are they not tremendously thrilled that it didn’t happen? How can you not realize that eventually when his dictatorship reached the point where he did something they didn’t approve of eventually &amp; inevitably he would get around to violating their human rights &amp; enriching himself on their property or money. How can anyone claim to be a patriot, but be disappointed &amp; unhappy that the military didn’t overthrow the legitimately elected government. Are they so turned on at the thoughts of watching liberals and racial activists get punished that they’re ok with it as long as they’re second in line instead of first? 

I cannot wrap my head around that. How can you call yourself a freedom living patriot &amp; simultaneously support someone who makes no pretenses at being anything but an authoritarian? How can you cheer for someone who calls for police to physically abuse people arrested for disagreeing with him, and not be smart enough to realize that eventually, inevitably that will eventually reach them &amp; their loved ones.  I fully realize that the Republican supporters entire platform is that it’s fine when bad things happen to other people as long as it’s not me. I get that it’s evil &amp; cruel, but to not understand that in doing that by supporting it they’re only at best delaying those same cruelty’s and abuses getting around to them &amp; their possessions families and friends. How can you be so short sited? I just cannot understand &amp; it’s been driving me insane, how can you so clearly work for and hope for what is definitely going to be your own demise..",QAnonCasualties

1748,I feel like QAnon exposes the hatefulness many Q people always had in them - we just didn't know.,"Of course, many of you may have Q people in your lives where maybe that's not true--they may have been open loving people before and have changed. But I think for a lot of us we are just now realizing that the Q persons in our lives were never as awesome as we thought they were. This has just exposed what they had hidden all along.

My oldest friend, who I'll call E, married a man who I'll call D. E and I were so close--close as sisters through school and through our 20s.  Initially I loved D too. I was in their wedding party. They both said I was their best friend. He DID have some red flags that I was willing to forgive back then because he was always cool to me and a good husband to my friend, and I believe people can change. (Felon, gun charges, had drug problem. Did his time and rehab).  D and my spouse had a falling out over a workplace issue, (D was laid off, my spouse was not, somehow this made my hubs the bad guy). Then D pretty much ignored me. Soon after that I moved away to the other side of the country and E and I kept in touch but I could no longer call her my best friend and we drifted apart.

D friended me last year and I was so happy at first, then I saw where he's been mentally (E posts almost nothing). First--shocked he was right-wing, but this is not a crime or anything of course, just a change. But everything is hateful. Calling all democrats and liberals names, posting news articles from extreme right wing questionable source racist online news sources. Anti-vax (and his wife is in the medical field?!?). Covid hoax. Q stuff. The area where they live got a lot of damage from a BLM protest and that didn't help. It made him more racist. And he used to have a very mixed bag of friends! What happened? Also--a lot of articles that are borderline homophobic, which blows my mind because he was openly and proudly bi when I knew him. Lots of articles about the evils of abortion and how democrats just want to kill babies. This one gets me because E has had more than one (ironically mostly due to an overly religious and restrictive upbringing that taught no sex education, offered no resources for birth control, and unapproachable parents). Has she not told him? How does she fare with him talking about how all women who have had abortions are evil?

I used to feel guilt I moved away--that I lost the closest friendship I ever had. Now I'm glad. I'm glad I didn't have to go through this in person and experience all that pain up close. Basically, think of the most open hipster dude ever and morph him into a Q asshole in a lifted truck. This hurts. But when I think of the pettiness with how he initially ended our close friendship, I realize this was always in him. Q just gave him permission to let it out.",QAnonCasualties

1750,Should I be afraid of my Q Mom?,"Am I just being paranoid, or should I really be afraid?

I recently told my mom that the line for me was refusing a vaccine and supporting insurrection/civil war.  I had no fing clue how deep it went until I read all of her message and educated myself on QAnon.  Now I am worried she may think I am not even human.

My mother has been outside the ""mainstream"" for as long as I can remember. Her and my stepfather’s conspiracy theories have been topics of momentary humor, followed by annoyance, but never really a danger to them. Admittedly, I knew QAnon existed, but it seemed so out there that I just didn't pay it much attention, even as it grew in 2020, but I honestly put it into one of the categories of things I had to ignore for the year to stay sane. 

My mother and I haven't seen each other in years, but she calls almost every week. We typically spend fifteen to twenty minutes on the phone, but in the last year, more so in the last few months, the calls got shorter, and the topics even more superficial. The last call was less than three minutes. We touched on some political stuff in late 2020 that may have triggered this, but the previous crescendo for me was when she said, ""Trump was sent her to save us."" My mother has been a democrat her entire life, and let's just say she is on the lower end of the social economic status that needs government assistance. The sarcastic me certainly didn't pass at such a fruitful statement, but I kept it respectableish. 

The unexpected and new crescendo was a long message that I won't post but covered a wide swath of topics that. At first, I honestly didn't see the entire message as I missed the tiny little arrow on the bottom right, the thrills of switching from Android to iPhone. Well, the shit that was in the longer message was really important such as the following:

\-Trump had ""900"" million votes

\-Dominion Voting Machines were rigged

\-Trump is in some alliance to save the world

\-In the next three to four months we are going back to an ""American Republic"" with ""Common Law,"" where ""evil"" will be ""removed,"" and replaced by ""good.""

\-Don't listen to the new media as they are owned by China - yes, I think she means all of them

\-Trump is taking down ""Cabal"" by March - I dunno what Cabal means

\-That there is ongoing ""weeding"" of the ""evil"" who are killing children, and that it will be done ""carefully"" to ""wake people""

\-Thinks Nancy Peolocis's stolen laptop has evidence on it that shows her and congress, and I think many governments of the world are in on it all

\-Wants me to watch ""Dr. Charlie Ward,"" ""Simon Parks,"" and ""Project Camelot""

\-Believes this is Gods will to ""heal"" our world from ""Draco,"" ""reptilians,"" and ""greys work."" And also, China I think.

\-That ""Pilidians"" and other ""Great Spiritual"" ones are helping Trump

\-""Evil wants to ""dehumanize"" the human race

\-Tell me to pick a side or my ""grandchildren"" will be ""sterile"" ""androids"" with no ""God Gene"" (""Chromosome 8"")

\-Tumps middle name is ""Jesus"" through a ""Merovingian"" blood line from ""Jesus &amp; Marry""

\-This is all allowed to happen so “Biden” can be revealed for his “crimes”

\-A nice heartwarming conclusion that Trump and God and Q are all working together to “rebirth” our humanity and our “God Given Future.”

Yesterday my YouTube feed suggested that I watch QAnon 101: The Search for Q by Vice ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsN96zE8FuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsN96zE8FuE)).  After watching it and rereading my mother’s texts, I realized that these fucking idiots are violent and ready for blood.  My mother probably sees me as a total outsider to QAnon, and maybe a threat.  She has stopped herself from saying things to me on the phone, but I didn’t’ realize it was QAnon related.  I figured she just didn’t want to share their latest hardship.

So now I have to ask myself if she really thinks it is time to choose a side, does she think I am on the other side?  Does she think I am human?  She knows where I live, and I couldn’t sleep last night thinking about the murders QAnon members committed against their family members.  Yes, my mother is mentally unstable, and I can actually picture her showing up at my door to “weed me from the earth.”

So again, I ask, Am I just being paranoid, or should I really be afraid?",QAnonCasualties

1752,How to tell your Q they’re usually wrong,"A little backstory: my mom was a fundamentalist Christian until her 60’s, after she read “the sacred mushroom and the cross” she stepped away from Christianity and then got....on the internet in 2015. She had never really been active on it before so it blew her mind. Whatever she read...it was true. During COVID she started sharing tons of Q stuff with me. Every step of the way I’ve tried to be delicate but also like “hey come on, this is ridiculous.” Yesterday she sent me the 2 hour youtube video of “Sergeant Robert Horton War Castles”. 😑

1753,My QFamily,"TL;DR - My entire family has ended up deep in the Q rabbit hole and I don't know how to get them to stop following this garbage.

Background: I'm a conservative from a typical middle class family. About a year ago was when my dad started down the rabbit hole and my mom joined him about a month ago. I've never really bought any CT as I'm one of those ""show me solid evidence"" kinds of people. My dad was always pretty deep into them but never really my mom until now. Everytime I'm over there all I hear about is how Biden isn't really the president for one ""reason"" or another and that the truth is gonna come out soon and whatever else they've heard on some janky news site.

I genuinely don't know what to do. Like they're not dumb people. I love my parents more than anything but it gets painful watching them follow this stuff so strongly. It's not just my parents either, it's all my extended family and their friends too which just puts them in an echo chamber on social media and when they start talking to people.

As I stated, I am a conservative (albeit not a typical one) but I can't stand this Q ordeal. It's split the republican party between conservatives and a cult.

So I end with this - fuck Q for not only splitting a party I support in half, but for making people I love look stupid.",QAnonCasualties
1754,For the Qperson in your life that thinks the vaccine is the “mark of the beast” this may help... it helped mine.,"I am a Christian and have noticed that a lot of these Q people are so zealous about this conspiracy because they mix it in with their faith. It’s a perfect cocktail for some pretty irrational behavior backed by what they believe is literally a matter of salvation. 

Regardless of what you believe, I can tell you that it helped wake up my former Q person when I used their own religion to debunk this vaccine being the mark of the beast nonsense. 

It’s very important to note that in the Christian faith, the mark of the beast has to be explicitly stated as so. It’s not something that you can take because you didn’t know what it was or you got tricked/fooled. When you receive the mark, there will be not grey area or confusion on what it is. It also is supposed to a mark on your right hand or forehead...not a shot. 

The above is not my opinion, that’s actually what Christianity teaches, therefore it would literally be against Christianity to think the vaccine is the “mark”. Once my q person understood that, their entire belief in Q crumbled and they are thankfully out of it now.",QAnonCasualties

1756,Mental Health is Seriously Declining,"I went for a walk in the rain today. I couldn’t handle it anymore. My parents and their listening 24/7 lives done by people who can’t even respect others. 

I’m so sick of it because it’s so damn clear that these people are twisting their words to prove their points. They cut videos off right where it contradicts them. My parents don’t know any better because they don’t speak English well. 

I don’t know if I should pity for them because they’re being taken advantage of or angry at them for not listing to me and taking opinions of people on the internet as facts. 

I can’t confront them anymore. They get too aggressive. They genuinely scare me but I don’t want them falling deeper into the black hole that this crap is. And it’s so easy for that to happen because people can simply say that anything that proves them wrong is a like or “fake news.” 

Anyway, I do have a question. Has anyone heard what the hell these Qs are talking about? Something about Biden banning a word?

She recently lost her IG page, it was shut down.    I just emailed her and told her that her youtube channel was next. I can sense it, she's let it run amok.  Her entire comments section went from fun banter and jokes between users, to Qanon nuts invading and screaming at us that Biden stole the election.  Biden is a CCP plant.  He is a dictator and more.   It became insufferable.    Nothing was fun anymore, because as soon as she posts and her fans began answering questions she posed concerning this new gossip or media piece, we were swamped with ""Oh, so you don't support Trump?  I see, you must want the destruction of our great country by China Biden!""  

It was literally ""ma'am this is a wendy's"" kind of mood.

1767,I Was Wrong,"Disclaimer: I originally posted this on the 20th, but used my main account. I got spooked and deleted it because I'm fearful of being doxxed in today's volatile environment. So here it is again, from my throwaway account.

***

I'm not really sure what I believe anymore. Not that I'm having a crisis of identity, but I made a promise to myself that I'd be here on Jan 20th if I was wrong.

I was wrong.

I am a Q follower and a Trump Supporter. Joe Biden wasn't supposed to be Inaugurated. And yet here we are, with Biden as the 46th President of the United States. 

My first goalpost move was on Nov. 4th, when Trump wasn't reelected in a landslide. Next goalpost move was the Electoral College. After that, the Joint Session of Congress certification. And now today. I don't really know what I was expecting. But I was expecting SOMETHING. 

What I got was nothing. No ""declass"", no arrests, no martial law, no Insurrection Act, no come from behind last minute Hail Mary followed by an onside kick and an extra point. Nothing. 

Confusion would be the best way to describe my current mood. A little disappointment. Some embarrassment. Maybe even relief? I mean, if Q was bullshit, maybe our world isn't being run by Satanic Paedophiles, right? (I tried to stay away from that end of the pool... a little too deep for my tastes). 

Anyhow, this post is for three reasons. 

* One, my own personal commitment to not moving the goalposts any further. 
* Two, to let you all know that there are those of us out there who (for whatever reasons) believed in the Q movement, and are now taking a hard look at how our beliefs do not line up with current events. 
* And three, a dear friend of mine posted about me, in this subreddit. He is one of the few that I ""came out"" to,  and the only person who has stopped talking to me.

I don't blame him and I take full responsibility for my own beliefs and actions (which were limited to various Pro-Trump and Pro-Q forums, always anonymous, and never encouraging violence or hatred towards anyone). In case I decide to link this to him, I'll call him Energised Honour.

I hope that he will someday accept my sincere apology and we can laugh about this years from now as ""that time Milk_Ranch fell for Q.""

I've read some of your stories. It's absolutely terrible what ideological extremism (regardless of the ideology itself) can compel us to do to one another. My hope is that the ones you love will decide that their relationship with you (and reality) are more important than whatever it is that they think is coming. Our country is deeply divided. We need more people like me to admit our mistake, and more people like you (hopefully) to say ""yeah, that was kinda dumb, but let's move forward together.""

1768,Qanon backtracking,"I made and lost a pretty good friend in 2020. In March during lockdown we had mutual friends on IG, and ended connecting that way and just started talking. It was really nice making a new friend in 2020, albeit not my normal avenues. But in July they started texting me about The Cabal; in august the declared Q’s work import; in September they were appalled at BLM. As I’m sure many here can relate, it didn’t get better and the conspiracies grew up to describing the inauguration like a battle between Michael and Lucifer. Then the night before  Capitol riots I found the last straw when they lumped me into a group of Biden supporters and told me the storm is coming. I stopped reaching out. I stopped checking in. And last night I get what I assume is a drunk text stating “so many humans think I am ‘deep into Q ’ which couldn’t be further from the truth. “

i've posted here once before about my abusive ex that got into Q. we've been broken up for about three years but he still calls/texts me however he can and the wounds keep opening up. this is a story ive never shared and it's been eating me alive for ages


my ex (idk we'll call him Jake) started out as a hardcore bernie supporter, very liberal, fun-loving, just all around a great guy. around 2015/16 he got DEEP into Q, specifically pizzagate and antisemitism. my dad is ex-military and now has a pretty good govt. job. nothing top-secret, just working on stuff with the Navy and DoD. 


Jake knows i have had a history with sexual assault and one day started drilling it into my head that my dad abused me. my dad abused me and he was the only good guy left because all the others were evil democrats working for the cabal. of course i thought it was ridiculous at first, but he was RELENTLESS. i felt disgusting even looking at my dad and even worse that i felt that way to begin with. he got me vulnerable and started trying to pull me into Q as well but obviously that didn't work. other than his occasional calls that send me spiraling, i haven't talked to him in years, thank god. to this day im still haunted by the fact he would ever try to turn me against my own father. to make it worse, Jake knew my mother was abusive (not Q-related, just a narcissist) - it felt like he tried to get me completely alone.

1770,How do I even respond to this,"I'm trying to get my SO back and we had a talk last week and I told him he could send me info if it makes him feel better. I'm genuinely trying to see where he is coming from (while holding onto the rope that is this sub for my own sanity!).

He sent me a link to ""health impact news"" about how many people have died ""from the vaccine"" (not posting the link as it seems to be against the rules?). It's so full of incredibly sensationalized nonsense. Even if I believed it it would be annoying to read. It makes up statistics while admitting to making them up and implying that all statistics are dumb anyways. It has multiple accounts of very old people who may have been in and out of hospice who, gasp!, died within two weeks of the vaccine. *Obviously* that means Fauci is a murderer!! (/s). 

How anyone can believe this is beyond me. I thought my SO was smarter than this. He is in the same field as me with a college degree. He understands many things better than me. His biggest downfall is his upbringing - very Christian (not that there's anything wrong with that, but obviously puts him at a disadvantage here) and conservative. 

But like, how do I even respond in a constructive way? My immediate reaction is ""you f\*cn idiot, this is obviously really stupid!"" but that isn't going to get me anywhere. And I feel like if I just say ""this is obviously sensationalized for their agenda"", it sounds dismissive. I am leaning towards not responding and if he brings it up I will say that it is sensationalized.

She is an artists, well travelled, not religious, had so many friends all over the world of all different race and had nothing against gay people ever. Her best friend is gay. But she was an antivaxer since the 80s. I could talk to her about anything and nothing was a taboo before the pandemic. We are both not religious and had many intresting talks regarding life in general. We had different views regarding the vaccine but that wasn't a biggy than. I think her antivaxer ideas got her down the rabbit hole. Starting with few posts on social media regarding the 5G and Bill Gates vaccine but quickly progressed into a Pizzagate and full right wing propaganda. Wtf, how a loving peace and love lady became in a few months pro life, pro Trump, pro martial low, against BLM, against gays and also calling doctors fascists??? At the beginning I tryed to debunk her posts and articles she forwarded to me and my husband. My husband ignored her posts but I spent hours researching the origin of her posts and replying to her comments privatly only. I was really hoping we could help her. I even teached her how to reverse google search images to find out where they originaded from. That was in the beginning of the pandemic when she was posting articles of birds dying from the 5G radiation.

All was good, until the pizza gate part. She lost her s**** and start yelling pizza gate is real. Do you not think the pedophile exists and some kids do get abused. I tryed to explain to her that of course pedophiles exist but the pizza gate is not real.

1776,Consolations and sympathies for all here,"Let me start by saying,  there are some incredible stories in here, and not in the good way.  Many of you have suffered extreme losses at the hands of this social aberration and for that you truly have my sympathy, and if any should need it, a person to talk to about what ails you.  The rest of this, can safely be skipped, so TL:DR.

The worst thing I've had to contend with really, is a band mate i play with was a die hard trumpist, but it seems he has done the patriotic thing and accepted that his dude lost, and to move on, but that's definitely not a common occurrence it seems.  In truth i haven't spoken with him about politics since the election, when we all get together we -try- to focus on music, but it usually creeps in at least a little, since the election though, i haven't had any memorable political interactions with him concerning trump.  For a while, i considered quitting the band because i couldn't deal with the conspiracy theories he kept shooting off... usually fixating on George Soros. I was starting to believe he had been getting into Q, and that was enough of a reason for me to not want to be around him while his mouth was making words.  

Thankfully however,  there hasn't been much said.  Many of you aren't so lucky.  You're losing friends. Family.  Lovers... and i feel a great sympathy for everyone whose lives have been uprooted or upturned by this conspiratorial nonsense.  

I hope those you've lost are not truly lost. And i hope that one day the darkness they have buried themselves in will clear, and they'll see the world with open eyes once again.... but i doubt that's the case.  As with most indoctrination, it's going to be something that can not only change the lives of the people we've lost, but to define their very existence on this earth, the justification and inspiration for all they do. .  

Us  vs. Them is a mentality and a problem as old as time. When the lines are clear and the stakes are real... then people have to make a stand for what they believe in.  The sad problem is, that these days what's ""real"" is apparently a matter of perspective. Objective truth has given way to social feedback loops and those can grossly skew any one's perspective to the point that we can't even agree on reality anymore.

As much as i wish i could say this is a disease,  and that trump was a virus... the truth is that they were both just symptoms.  In the quest to understand life, the world, and our place in it.... it's too easy to get lost.  So far off the beaten path that you don't even remember how to get back. So when people find meaning, something that makes sense to them, they'll cling to it no matter what anyone says about it.  The real problem is so much more than just one conspiracy theory, or one demagogue pulling the strings of a nation... no, the real problem is people, their willful ignorance, confirmation biases, and a general lack of understanding of the notion that incredible claims require incredible proof. 

But please, if you made it this far... don't give up on them.  Don't encourage or even entertain their fallacies.  Don't engage them at all on anything related to Q, trump, elections, patriotism, secret cabals, or anything concerning politics or religion really (pretty safe bet as a general rule).  Engage them only on things you used to enjoy together and make it clear they are still your people, if they want to be... but that this part of your relationship dies now, never to be resurrected.  If they can agree and show some effort, then you should do everything in your power to mend the fences, that's the only way to start bringing them back into the trodden path.  

And if they can't agree... don't close the door.  Unless they are abusive and need to be excised from your life, make it clear... when they are ready, you'll be there.  Only love and understanding can bring them back.  Only compassion and companionship can remind them of what's been lost.  

When there's no more  Us vs. Them... we'll all live in paradise.  And that's worth striving for. 


Peace be with you all.  Best wishes, and best of luck.",QAnonCasualties
1777,It's been 6 days and my Qmom has doubled down on the crazy,"I thought,  hoped, that maybe she'd give it up, but she's a narcissist and would never EVER admit she was wrong. I assumed she would do what she always does in these situations, and pretend the entire thing never happened and act like everything was normal. 
We don't talk anymore,  her last message to me was before the 6th making a last ditch attempt to warn me of "" something bad is coming "".
She's a former nurse (only former because she has lupus and can no longer work) so now her Q conspiracy all centers around Covid and how they're trying to control you with a vaccine. 
She has almost given up on the whole Trump, but holds out hope that something will happen March 4th. 
 I've followed her into some of her chat rooms under an assumed name because she has totally stopped posting on "" Fakebook"".
The shit she is saying is absolutely bonkers. It's like some of the Q conspiracies have now turned into a religious and spiritual movement.  They keep talking about Gaia and being enlightened, and adding new conspiracies about the second coming.
My Q aunts and uncles have accepted Q wasn't real, but are still hell bent that the election was stolen , Kamala Harris is secretly a man, and other toxic rhetoric.  They're big mad, like BIG mad.

1778,Searched “Where do corona viruses come from” on Google and got a conspiracy page calling COVID the “China Virus” as the second Ad result.,"[Screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/w7Kzcf9)

This is so disheartening. Until these tech companies get their shit together we are fighting a losing battle, my friends. 

I searched “where do corona viruses come from” because while ago I had read they usually originate in humid equatorial areas and I was trying to find a source that says this for another comment I was making on another [unrelated] sub. Notice my search wasn’t even about COVID specifically. 

Instead I got this piece of shit website with racist, antiscience, Q adjacent terminology as the second ad result on google. I didn’t even watch the videos. 

I don’t expect it to do anything but I left feedback scolding Google for allowing this page to appear as the SECOND result when you search a basic question about corona viruses. I don’t really care that it was labeled “Ad” as it’s still the second link you see when searching the question. People who are less tech literate or not critical thinkers will see this info and probably not even realize it’s an ad. 

This isn’t the first time this has happened. A few months ago I searched something about a yoga pose. I don’t remember exactly what it was but it completely unrelated to the pandemic, and I got a result about a covid being a hoax and a pedo cabal running the world. 

I am SO tired of being at the mercy of these companies and these algorithms. I see the effects of it in my daily life. It is a war on reality as we know it.

1780,Qanon: A magical world view to make you feel special,"Mom was a schizo who committed suicide when I was 17. She had a magical world view. I went to live with my estranged father, turns out, he was paranoid as well. All I had was my sister. We promised each other we would always be there for the other. I got out of that nasty ass oil town, best decision I ever made. If you live there, you don't live in the real world. Their reality is not the broader reality. 

Last year my grandmother had a stroke and died in March, my father sat outside the hospital room and fawned over 4chan or 8kun or whatever it's called and showed me all the Q stuff. I ignored him. Until he dragged my sister into it. 

My sister is now a Qanon. When she tried to get me to join the cult I told her she was delusional and we literally have a genetic history of mental illness, paranoia and psychosis( and she would be smart to recognize that). My whole lifes goal up to this point has been to avoid the same potholes of reason my parents stumbled into. I tried so hard to reason with her, but in the end she attacked me, called me a sheep and tried to blame me for our moms suicide. She died 12 years ago, this coming March. I went to therapy for it and have moved on, but obviously my sister hasn't.

I thought once Biden took office maybe she would come to her senses, but I doubt it. She has three children who I adore but can no longer speak to. Shits hard you guys. I'm trying to find the intersection of compassion and accountability that will guide me in dealing with these people but for now I'm at a loss.

1784,I think I got my friend out before it was too late.,"I'm not sure if my story belongs here, but I wanted to share it.

I don't think my friend was ever fully into Q. He loves conspiracy theories and sometimes falls for bits of them, like saying about the Vegas shooting, ""I don't doubt he did it, but he must have had help and he was just the fall guy.""

He's smart enough to know the 5G and Vaccine Tracker crap his family believes is utter nonsense, but every once in a while he would say something vaguely Q-ish. Something like, ""Trump has some kind of grand plan, it just isn't the time to start it yet."" Or, ""I don't think the Pizzagate 

Now, I love debating politics, much to my father-in-law's annoyance. It's how I grew up. Everyone in my family was able to freely state their own ideas with the understanding that the rest of us would do our best to poke holes in their logic and you had to defend your position. As well as loving a good debate, I am also a self proclaimed, ""leftist nutjob."" Personally I think Americanism such as the Pledge of Allegiance is cult-like and dangerous, countries shouldn't exist, and our currency should be based on something more substantial and easily regulated than the hopes and wishes of a select few people who's best interests are to squeeze every resource out of the lives of people and the very planet itself. I am very used to having to back up my arguments against a room full of people who disagree with me.

My friend has never had this kind of interaction with people, but he himself says he enjoys the challenge of putting up a fight for your ideas rather than just having someone automatically agree with you.

Now, my friend and I were having a debate about guns. I personally don't like guns, but I'm fine with other people having them. With a history of depression I just don't think I can trust myself with a firearm in the house. Our conversation went something like this.

Me: Nobody on the left has ever wanted to take your guns away, that has always been a Right-wing scare tactic. What we want is proper education, licensing, and registration for firearms. The same as a car, different sizes of vehicles need different amounts of training depending on the danger they introduce to people and property, as well as you must register those vehicles to your name so they may be accounted for in case of theft or wrongdoing.

Him: Well if you are going to argue for education of firearms, I say that firearm safety should be taught in schools. It's part of the constitution, so should be included in the public education curriculum.

Me: If we're going to bring Constitutional literalism into this, I say we add onto that Religious Studies classes, and not just Christian Studies, but a complete education on the top ten religions of the world so that people can make informed decisions on what they want to follow in their faith if they choose to follow any at all.

Him: ......I think I agree with you.....

That small agreement opened a small hole of doubt into his world view. We discussed how he claims to support things like gay and Trans rights yet votes for people who do their best to treat those communities as sub-human. We talked about the BLM movement, and I explained to him what systematic racism really is, and how events from hundreds of years ago can still be seen and felt today. He had no idea what Red-Lining or Black Wall Street were. He believes that drugs are a symptom of something like mental health problems, addiction, or pain management when people have lack of access to proper health care, and I asked him why he voted for people who view people who use drugs as criminals rather than victims and would rather lock them in a cell than get them the treatment they need.

Then, today, to my surprise, before we talked about anything else he told me, ""I'm switching parties. I feel like I've been shooting myself in the foot just because I've always been told it's what I'm supposed to do.""

I don't know what this means for his future, and I don't know what this means for his relationship with his family, but that's already on shaky ground as it is for other reasons.

My mother has fallen for this bullshit, but This post isn’t about a loved one lost to the Qult. It’s about me. I’m obsessed with QAnon. I’m worried about what it’s doing to my mental health.

I literally hate them. Seeing any sort of Q content anywhere instantly fills me with intense rage. I’m starting to realize I might have a serious problem. I don’t want to hurt anyone myself, but I find myself wishing ill upon people in the Qult.

I’ve been following the movement since the beginning. I’m a natural skeptic and enjoy “debunking” and deconstructing conspiracy theories, and have been doing it for a while in the form of a YouTube channel and Blog. I followed QAnon very closely, mostly because it was hilarious and entertaining. Then I started witnessing the harassment, stalking and intimidation campaigns. The lies and manipulation. The gas lighting. The toll it took on my mothers mental state. My hatred grew steadily until January 6th.

And now, the images of the Qterrorist attack on the US Capitol have amplified my anger significantly. These people are not only destroying families, they’re trying to destroy the entire country!  They WANT people like me to suffer. They want to hurt us. They fantasize about it constantly. And my mother chose these sick freaks over her family. 

I felt nothing for the woman shot by police at the Capitol. Not even for her family. That’s what is making me realize it’s becoming extremely unhealthy for me. I’m usually very compassionate and empathetic. I surf the web looking for posts and screenshots of the online meltdowns they had during the Biden inauguration, just so I can revel in their despair. I have a huge collection of images of people talking about how devastated they are that none of it was real. How theyre “feeling sick” because there was no mass genocide. How their lives are ruined because they’ve alienated themselves from others in their lives, all for a lie. How they’re giving up hope. Because that how they’ve made me feel for a while now

1789,"If your relative is not tech-savvy, restrict their internet access","I’m glad I found this subreddit, everything here matches up exactly to what my mum has been putting us through.

It started off with a few whacky conspiracies, it was quite funny to begin with. Flat Earth, 5G, anti-vax, moon landing, underground society in the arctic... you name it, she believed all of them. All. Of. Them.

In the UK, our most popular left wing party is called the Labour Party. She has supported Labour all her life, but for some absolutely insane reason she is a believer in Trump and QAnon, which is the antithesis to what her political beliefs normally are.

She honestly believes that the USA is under military rule as part of the constitution, and that there is no current president. Just so everyone is aware, military rule is not mentioned in the constitution at all... anyway...

I have found that restricting access to any and all social media - without her knowledge - via the router works to some degree. On one hand, my mum is now convinced that she is right and that she is being spied on, but on the other hand she is not exposed to it any more and can’t keep up with the latest news.

Her work laptop has a VPN that gets around blocking sites, but I ended up restricting internet access to it completely before and after her regular work hours and that seems to work.

I also managed to install Google Family Link on her phone and tablet and set myself as the parent. I set her account as the child, meaning she now can’t download any new confounded messaging apps that QAnon all congregate to whenever another one of their platforms gets shut down. I used an entirely new email with a similar name to hers. I named myself, the parent account, the same as her name, just to confuse her and make her think she’s done it to herself somehow.

This might only work in very rare cases, but it’s worth a try if you get the chance. If they believe they are right, then I can personally live with that and let it die out very slowly due to a lack of exposure. It has turned her into an almost unrecognisable person, but we have had a lot of talks with her and in combination with restricting her access I think we’re starting to get her back.",QAnonCasualties
1790,"Long post with dirty details, hope this will help deprogram some QAnon followers.","Hello, former Q-members and people who have lost friends and family to the Qult.

I'll start by saying this post will be fairly long, but worth your time. I hope what I share today can help deprogram Q-followers, and maybe shed some light on exactly what so many people have fallen for.

I'll come outright and say it - QAnon is a massively coordinated alt-right troll campaign, a psy-op practically 15 years in the making. It traces back to some pretty infamous hackers and neo-Nazi trolls. I know this because, I was there when they were growing and taking root in 4Chan culture in \~2005.

Let's start in the early 2000s, before social media as we know it. For social media, we only had blog communities like Xanga and LiveJournal. Basically online journals. We also had instant messaging like AIM, ICQ, Yahoo, and we had IRC, which is like a very oldschool Discord.

I'll skip all the boring bits. A group of friends who enjoyed trolling LiveJournal ended up making a website, you've probably heard of it - Encyclopedia Dramatica.

The original purpose of ED was to document LiveJournal trolling, Wiki-style. The troll group behind Encyclopedia Dramatica called themselves Bantown.

The original Bantown group were mostly cool people, just regular internet trolls. Some notable members are now legit veterans in greyhat security, or work for big tech companies. It was teenage cyberpunk culture, trolling the internet and getting a reaction out of people. Some of them don't even want to remember these old days of internet trolling, and I can't blame them.

But between 2005 \~ 2006, Encyclopedia Dramatica started focusing a lot more on 4chan culture. Instead of focusing on LiveJournal drama, Encyclopedia Dramatica started documenting every 4chan meme, every butthurt Youtube vlogger, etc.

ED basically became a Wiki for all things troll and meme related. This is actually why the original ED founder ended up shutting down the site. ED became a wiki for 4Chan culture.

Well anyway, ED had its own IRC channel. It was mostly lurkers and Wiki contributors, but there were a few legit blackhats to be found. Some of those blackhats went under the group name GNAA - Gay N\*\*\*ers from Outerspace.

The leader of GNAA was Andrew Auernheimer, aka Weev. You've probably heard of him, he is sadly a ""legend"" amongst trolls. He was also a giant neo-Nazi, even in those days he was always rambling about the Jews and conspiracy theories.

Weev's approach to trolling was the ultimate ""shock-humor"" style. Floodposting ASCII swastikas, gaping butthole images, etc. At the time, we all kind of thought his neo-Nazism was a schtick, an act, he was doing it for shock.

I'm not happy to say but in 2007, when Weev and GNAA launched ""JewsDidWTC.com"" and it was covered on CNN, we all thought it was the most hilarious thing because we didn't take it seriously.

CNN reporting on JewsDidWTC.com troll website (2007) [https://youtu.be/0ps2yKvn5Ng](https://youtu.be/0ps2yKvn5Ng)

Looking back, it really set the groundwork for the past 4 years.

So a lot of us started to realize that Weev's whole ""neo-Nazi schtick"" was actually real, he actually believed all this stuff about Jews being the inferior race, white supremacy, etc.

The GNAA's trolling campaigns started to get really bad, it wasn't about making people cry on the internet anymore, they were actually out to ruin journalists' lives and stuff.

For example, in 2007, Weev and GNAA crew doxxed programmer and developer Kathy Sierra. I don't even remember why, it was just a ""funny"" thing for them to do.

Kathy Sierra started getting death threats and stuff, she had to cancel public appearances at tech conferences. I was there in IRC channel when they were doing all this, they were lulzing about how this poor woman was literally afraid to go outside.

Most of the GNAA crew has pretty much dicked off into obscurity, maybe some of them still pal around with Weev. But Weev himself has been a pretty consistent face of alt-right neo-Nazi trolling even today.

Weev ended up going to prison in 2012 for a silly little script that exposed some flaws in AT&amp;T. Actually a lot of people defended him, even people that knew he was a major neo-Nazi douchebag, the charges against him were actually really stupid and flimsy.

Weev came out of prison a couple years later, with an actual swastika tattoo on his chest. He then dicked off to Ukraine and somehow became the webmaster for The Daily Stormer. If you haven't heard of The Daily Stormer, it's basically a neo-Nazi news board.

Weev, being the experienced alt-right troll he is, pretty much had a following at this point. If Weev breathed into a podcast mic, little alt-right peckers stood up around the internet. He was also highly familiar with 4Chan culture from the ED days, so The Dailer Stormer because like the neo-Nazi version of 4chan's /pol board and attracted all of those folks as well.

The owner of The Daily Stormer is Andrew Anglin. Imagine that, Andrew Anglin and Andrew Auernheimer. Couple of Andrews, trolling in the name of white supremacy!

Another notable contributor to The Daily Stormer? Fredrick Brennan, founder of 8Chan. Puzzle pieces starting to fit yet?

So anyway, The Daily Stormer (Weev + Anglin) had their own little troll army by this point. They were heavily involved in Gamergate, doxxing (""ruining"") journalists, they even trolled Alex Jones and Breitbart, even though they're sort of on the ""same side"".

Actually, Andrew Anglin loves Alex Jones - [https://revealnews.org/blog/the-hate-report-infowars-is-the-gateway-drug-for-white-supremacists/](https://revealnews.org/blog/the-hate-report-infowars-is-the-gateway-drug-for-white-supremacists/)

So you've got this huge alt-right troll army, and the 2016 Trump campaign. How did these two forces collide?

In Weev's own words: [http://alphavilleherald.com/2016/09/interview-with-alt-right-pepemancer-and-kektrump-supporter-weev.html](http://alphavilleherald.com/2016/09/interview-with-alt-right-pepemancer-and-kektrump-supporter-weev.html)

*""We took thousands of kids, trained them in basic graphics, got them bullying journalists with custom Pepes. There was this one girl that would constantly get Pepes raping her dismembered corpse every day. Basically we explicitly targeted journalists and Hillary campaign staffers relentlessly. We drove these people insane, a plague of frogs was upon them for a year, and suddenly they are screaming in public about a cartoon frog, and looking like fucking morons.""*

1793,Manic Q MIL on Conspiracy Bender,"As background, my MIL suffers from a personality disorder. She’s a totally functional person typically, but will occasionally have what we call “episodes”, during which she can pretty manic - usually just super hyper and high energy. She’s always been a super Trumper, so I suppose we could have foreseen what’s happening now. But, I guess we always thought “she’s not THAT kind of person, she knows better than that.” About five days ago she apparently went down a rabbit hole of conspiracy videos. Yesterday my MIL called my BIL in a manic craze, crying tears of joy talking about how the world is going to change, she kept saying “remember what I’m telling you, my son.” Super weird, and not like her. So, my wife was concerned and decided to check on my MIL. When she arrived my MIL was napping (thankfully, after apparently being up 3 days straight binging videos). My MIL woke up and immediately started in - March 4th Trump will be King of the world, there will be no CIA or IRS, everyone will get 10k/month, the inauguration didn’t happen on the 20th, Pelosi eats babies, all Democrats (which we are) are devil worshipers , Trump is Jesus, etc. Crazy/scary shit. My wife was in shock, she said she sat there and just said calmly “you can’t believe this stuff. You’re going to lose everyone”. My MIL just laughed and said she doesn’t have anyone any way, and she’s just so happy her kids and grandkids will be in a new world soon. 

My FIL is distraught, he tried to suggest she go with him to a doctor to talk, and she told him to “fuck off”. My MIL went to her therapist today, who she now calls the devil because she doesn’t believe in Q. The therapist told us that she’s not capable of being committed because she’s not a danger to herself or others, and she just needs us all to “listen quietly”. 

We’re at a loss. The way my wife describes it, it’s almost scary to hear my MIL talk now - it’s as if she’s on Ecstacy or cocaine, she smacks her lips and needs water constantly. Keeps talking about how she’s seen the light and is the happiest she’s ever been. We think she needs a psychiatrist and potentially medication, but there’s absolutely no way she will be open to either (she’s the happiest she’s ever been, according to her). 

Does anyone have any tips for dealing with someone with a personality disorder (borderline and narcissistic) that’s fallen prey to Q? I want to be empathetic, and I don’t want to make her worse, but I also don’t want to be around her when she’s like this.  

It’s heartbreaking to watch my wife and BIL try to navigate their mom right now. I keep hearing to just let her say these things and not to react, but I don’t see how that’s possible from a mental health standpoint, how do we just listen to her say this stuff? And act this way? At this point I don’t even trust her to be around my kids without supervision. 

I can’t believe I’m even posting here. If you had asked me a week ago, I would have laughed thinking there’s no way someone in my life who I love would be someone who is all about Q. Yet, here I am. Dumbfounded and pretty worried about my MIL, my wife, and our relationship with her. 

Thanks in advance for the input, and for just letting me vent.",QAnonCasualties
1794,I hate this.,"I just need to vent. 

I live in a rural part of the US and no matter where I turn, there’s someone who believes Q lies. Maybe they aren’t all in, but they’re heading there. 

I have friends who I’ve lost to this Qult, close family friends that I respected and trusted, gone and replaced by this new person I don’t know. I feel like I’m in some horror/sci-fi movie where half the people are zombies and the rest of us just have to watch on in terror. 

The worst part for me is seeing church leaders fall for this. My spouse and I left our church over different issues but I remained friends on social media with many of the pastors or their family, close friends and spouses - most of them believe in some aspect of Q and some subtly or outright post about it. This is especially horrifying to me as they’re leading vulnerable congregations who trust them - just churning out more little Q robots ready to die at the altar.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how we as a society get out of this place, how to help these people. And I’m deeply saddened that we will almost certainly lose so many more before it’s all said and done.",QAnonCasualties

1796,My thoughts from someone who supports Trump and semi-likes Q,"I'm not going to say I'm the more hardcore Q person in the world but I have been reading the Q forums since Jan 6th since it became clear probably the only way Trump could win was Q being real and he had a plan involving the military.

I don't think Q people are crazy. They are analytical research driven people who may have been taken for a ride by a sophisticated operation. There are connections between Q posts and Trump's tweets like typos or references to storms that match the earlier Q posts. There appear to be times where Q and Trump posted within a minute of each other. To the point where I'm not ruling out Q being created by Trump and his team. He may have just made it for other reasons such as thinking it would help his voting base. It's believable that with enough of these connections people thought there was something to it. A lot of Q people are mostly harmless nerds who've collected all these references. The leap was always that they would reveal their epic military plan on anon forums. The official explanation was ""When the world finds out about this people's reality will be so broken that they will need friends and family members to help make the transition"". Which is a stretch but ok, I can see it's better than no explanation at least.

For the satanic pedos thing, well Epstein and Maxwell did exist so the idea of rich pedos being out there isn't totally crazy, and I do believe it's possible many politicians are corrupt and really under control of the billionaire power brokers out there, war profiteers, big pharma, etc.. The potential explanation for why pedophilia would be that it's a way to sell your soul. By agreeing to make a video where you do pedo stuff, whoever has that video owns you from now on. So the person sells out for fortune and power but in return they have to make pedo videos so they are now under control. Again I'm not sure if this is real or not but that would be one way to explain it rather than just all the most powerful people being coincidentally into kids.

Especially since Nov 3rd a lot of Q people are driven by hope that their guy Trump is going to win and latching onto the chance. I don't think people who want corrupt politicians and pedos to be brought to justice are the problem. Yes there may be some gullibility but their intentions are decent in my opinion.",QAnonCasualties
1797,"guilt, anger, empathy"," I'm so fucking mixed up right now. My dad is so deeply invested in Trump and QAnon that he has completely fucked everything his father worked for til the day he died. Forced his mother, my complete saint of a grandmother, to sell their house and income property in one of the most desirable cities to live in and move out to BFE Oklahoma. She and my Uncle, his brother, both have heart conditions and now 0 infrastructure to manage them. My germaphobe Uncle is being forced to attend medical visits where he is regularly in contact with unmasked people. They feel unsafe and disconnected where they live, though they love the new house itself. I got the you-told-us-so call a few days ago, and I feel more upset than before. I managed to get my grandmother to stop actively propagating Q material on facebook, and my impression is that she just doesn't know what to believe at this point and is trying to avoid politics. I can understand that, at least. She is an extremely kind woman who was taken in on the child-trafficking claims and nothing else, it wasn't too hard to talk to her.

My dad is so fucking sick now. He's in recovery and has now taken up gambling for fun, and has been going to the casinos and coming home (endangering the remainder of the at-risk household) since they reopened. He openly brags about being at bars, smoking and singing maskless. He voted for Trump in 2016 because he hated Hillary and the libertarian candidate wasn't going to win (or so he told me). Now he's so far gone he can do nothing but post on Twitter about HCQ and how he refuses to bend to ""covid fascist edicts"" and won't allow himself to be ""reprogrammed"" by the government. He railroaded my whole family into tearing up their roots and starting anew in a brand new place and now he isn't even unpacking because he plans to move to Texas with his girlfriend. My Uncle gave up the business he built for over a decade, and the relationship he'd been in for nearly as long. All of my grandma's comfort and independence have been stripped away. I kept begging them not to do it, I kept telling them it wasn't safe, but they were constantly being manipulated with my dad in the house and everyone screaming about the stupid governor trying to destroy everyone's livelihoods with shutdowns. So many people are dead, and all he could be assed to think about was his own freedom. I begged and begged, but my grandma just won't think of herself or her wellbeing. They used her for her money so that they could afford to move, and they are already priced out of the market they just left. My childhood home, lemon trees, rose vines, ugly old tile and all is being rented out to randoms now. The thought of picking up and moving again sounds horrific but less horrific than the consequences of staying where they are and in a home with him.

I found out the day after the Capitol riot that he had traveled all the way to DC to take part when a friend I had at my last job sent me a news article with his extremely unique name in it. There he was, in front of God and everybody, disgracing the family name and making us look like a bunch of hateful lunatics. I wonder if I'll ever be able to get a job again. I was planning on changing my name when I get married, I might have to do it sooner. That day I discovered the extent of his issues (3200 tweets in 3 months) and how awful the things he was saying had become. When I found out he was one of the people joining 'militias"" to ""keep the peace"" during the George Floyd protests, I knew he was gone. I didn't understand how deeply he had bitten into the conspiracies until now. Being someone who has frequented 4chan from much too young an age, it was so hard to fucking explain to these people that the things they were sharing (literal photos of computer screens showing 4chan posts!!! I'm not even making this shit up) came from a place with complete anonymity and less vetting for posts than any of their social media platforms, let alone wikipedia. An actual forum full of gore, porn, and memes. I could not get through to them, but now even my Uncle who voted for Trump thinks he has gone too far. 

This week has been a fucking mess for me. This is the man I used to call my hero. He used to be an avid musician, a gentle hand on my shoulder when I was wound up and tense, a patriot in the military who served and strove to better himself. There were several times in my life when it was us, and just us. I have been neglected or abused by most of my family, including him. My conflicted feelings go back further than when he started to openly oppose women's rights, back before QAnon even existed. But he is a different person now. He is not the man who spent all the cash in his wallet to win me the biggest dog at the booth in the fair, nor the man who brought me a copy of our favorite book when I was hospitalized for making an attempt on my life, nor the man who took me to see snow, stars, and the countryside in thousand-mile-trips cross country. He's gone. I am crying here with the letter he slipped me when I was in the mental hospital with instructions to read it when I was hurting. Here it is, the final sentence, a quote older than both of us. ""You have been, and always shall be, my best friend."" 

I reported him to the FBI the day before the inauguration. You won't see me on the news being called a hero, I am here in my home unable to sleep or eat, existing in obscurity. I have no parents anymore, though my chosen family is wiser than me to say I never really did. When I found out he had not returned home after the riot, and had a weapon with him, the choice was made for me. None of the adults in my family have the strength to even stand up to him, they certainly aren't going to grow up now.

I don't know where he is, or what's going to happen. I don't think he can go back to being that person, he is as invested in avoiding admitting he is wrong as he is in getting his way. His actions are those of a bitter man who feels wronged by the world and is trying to extract what he can for himself from society. It saddens me to say that I am not his only child, which makes that outlook even more disturbing. I started treatment for PTSD a couple months ago, and I am barely functioning. Today, I had to email my landlord and go to the post office. I have already broken down three times, and drank until I could pass out for a few hours this afternoon. The nightmares are intense. The shaking is intense. I keep remembering things he did and said, good and bad. I wish I knew how to get through to him. He calls me a fucking libtard. The last safe space I had is gone because of him. He just doesn't care, about his kids, his mother, nothing. My grandfather is rotting in a grave miles from the product of his life's achievements, and the family is slowly going broke now. I stopped thinking of him as family years ago, but going through this with his mother is really difficult.

I am sorry for being all over the place. I feel like I'm barely surviving right now, for a combination of reasons that reach far beyond my parents.",QAnonCasualties
1798,My dad is baby steps away from being a Q follower. Can I stop it?,"I'm kind of at my wits end and thought I'd reach out here to people who have gone through it.
Forgive the long explanation  its hard for me to unpack it all without a bit of a narrative.

I'm not even American, so it goes to show this stuff is globally pervasive.

I should preface this by saying, my dad has a limited education, only to about grade 8. So alot of the conventional advice I've been given doesn't really stick. I can't counter his conspiracies with credible sources, because he never learned what that means, so it doesn't even register to him.

My dad... has always been a racist. I'm not excusing that at all. I got my fair share of childhood trauma from it. It is painfully ironic because he is biracial himself and faced racism in his life too. He's always been racist in a way that he's the centrist passive racist. In my childhood I remember that he would use slurs, and be uncomfortable with other cultures, but he always insisted he didn't want any harm, and he could be civil in public, he just wanted them out of his business. At family gatherings he would say his racism like jokes, probably to seek validation. It always stayed in the home, is what I'm saying.

Still awful and just as bad. Not excusing that. This is just for context to show that he's gotten very used to that being his normal.  Alot of our family and neighbors and family friends would roll their eyes at his jokes or tell him to shut up, that kind of thing. But what I'm saying is I don't recall anyone, even my mother, ever taking him to task for it. And now he's worse and I fear its too late.


When I talk to him now, its like talking to a bot. Its like auto-generated slogans he just repeats. I do attempt to argue with him. Im probably the only one out of my family to raise my voice at him. That started as soon as I left home, and I was out of that weird dynamic. But now its like no matter how much I tell him its dangerous,infuriating, hurtful, hypocritical, outright fake. No matter how evidently angry I am, if I don't pick up the bait he's putting down, he just carries on the conversation as if he didn't say anything odd. And thats the unsettling thing to me. He can go from saying some bullshit like "" Justin Trudeau is a puppet for the kabal  backed UN to let muslim jihadists take over and kill Christians for one world power like Hitler wanted"" And I'll tell him the site he sent me is fake, and he never was a Christian ever, so where is this all coming from?

And then he will just flip a switch and go back to talking about his dog, or a movie he saw, or ask me about my car. Something ain't right even for him.


Of course I'll always care for my dad, but over the last 2 years I've really distanced myself from him. I'm not even sure he realizes and that's the weirdest part. It just made me depressed and exhausted to talk to him that I really wondered why I was even doing it anymore, so I stopped. But then that makes me anxious because I wonder if I'm just being like my mother and everyone else who enabled him for so long. The only times I talk to him is if he hops on the line when I call someone else's phone. I live on the opposite coast from him so its not like I see him in person. ( almost a year now with the pandemic)

Now my dad has not ever mentioned anything about Q, thank God. But I think its only a matter of time. He's obviously obsessed with Facebook, he knows about kabal stuff, but I think he wouldn't be tech savvy enough to get into 4chan or sketchy discords or anything.

But the building blocks are there. His ways have hurt my family for long enough. Is there any strategy to put the brakes on him once and for all?",QAnonCasualties

Google was hard to understand and the websites for them seem to want information that I am unwilling to give in order to learn more.

Her husband was a sheriff and went down the deep dark QAnon rabbit hole and took her with him. When the BLM marches broke out in March, I came out in support of them, and denounced Proud Boys and QAnon. 

She immediately deleted me on FB and Instagram and blocked my messages. I texted her to see what was up and she responded that I was a pedo lover who wanted her husband dead and she had to end the friendship for the safety of her family.

The MIL is a sweet lady, and raised my wife to be a very loving, patient woman, but she doesn't seem to have a mind of her own these days. She actually converted to Mormonism when she met her husband. The FIL is just a couch potato, who is an expert in everything that he watches on TV. It's really pathetic to listen to him. Dude was a roofer for 40 years, but yet knows more about the vaccines than scientists for example. What he actually is an expert in is conspiracy theories and Qanon.

We had a baby awhile back, and they were over to visit once. We don't have cable TV, or any TV really, and so he just wandered around the place like a lost puppy looking for something to do. His anxiety about not having cable TV was a huge bummer. He came downstairs from a 3 hour nap, and sits on the couch, and MIL is like, ""Are you ok?"", and he's like, ""Well, I'm depressed."" At that point, I am not even kidding here, we all just had to walk away, including MIL. I mean, the dude has a beautiful new grand daughter, who is seems to be completely unaware of, and I personally don't coddle SOB's like that. It was the most visceral display of pathetic loserishness, that I had ever witnessed in my life.

I was about to step in there and put him in his place, but he's not my dad so... He refuses to acknowledge his daughter's success (our success) in business.

1814,Was anyone’s loved one largely apolitical before Trump/conspiracy/Qanon?,"My dad was always “Republican-ish.” He even voted for a few local democratic politicians. He does have a high income and definitely benefits from conservative tax cuts. Other than that, he’s always been accepting of LGBTQ+ and pro-choice. And now....he’s a complete Qanon freak. 

It started with Trump, who he oddly supported for reasons unknown to me. My father is educated and lives in a liberal area...the whole thing was so odd to me. He had a defense for ALL of Trump’s actions, even got a Yeti cup engraved with “I Stand,” in response to NFL players kneeling. 

Covid has completely kicked him off the deep end. He says it’s a “fake pandemic.” This is after my mother and sister ( both of whom he lives with) got COVID and were practically bedridden/exhausted for a month. My mom now uses an inhaler. Yet he says “It’s the flu, it’s not a global pandemic.” He sends me all kinds of very fake articles with non-medical doctors or public health experts. I told my dad, “Do you really think every Doctor, Nurse, EMT, coroner in the WORLD has conspired to create this virus?” He basically said yes, so they would get more funding. 

And now he’s completely into Q Theories. I literally worked for the Sex Trafficking Task Force in my home county (where he lives, I have moved). Basically, I know all the key players where he lives the fact that nearly all the supporters WERE DEMOCRATS. When telling him, “I have personally met everyone in the human trafficking task force where you live, and they all pretty much leaned blue, even the police officer involved,” we just didn’t listen to me. He said that immigrants were sex trafficking people in with COVID. I am like WTF?? Where are you getting that information??! 

The biggest issue I have is how weird he has become about race. He is vehemently against affirmative action, think BLM was all Antifa, and talks about Black-on-Black crime *in Chicago* whenever you bring up police brutality. Mind you, he lives no where near Chicago. 

My concern now is that my fiancé is Jewish. While my Dad has never said a bad word about Jewish people, what he’s aligning himself with is incredibly anti-Semitic. He is supportive of my relationship, but then again Trump was also supportive of Jared Kushner.

I want to be assertive but still polite, and I don't know how. I don't know how honest I should be because I want them to get out of the qult, but at the same time they might be a lost cause anyway. I don't know what the best approach is.

Also, I live in the same house as them so it's going to get really uncomfortable IRL. I'm also worried for my other parent being convinced into the conspiracies.

My husband and I just got news that his sister and her husband are quitting their jobs and moving to Oklahoma within the next few weeks. We found out after the election that they have been ""Q pilled""  when we kept getting lot's of strange texts about Biden stealing the election, links to 'The Great Awakening', and further spinning out in regards to blackouts, child sex rings and baby killers.

1819,How do I make the final push to kick him out and quit my job?,"Okay so, I'm surrounded by conspiracy theorists. I live with my boss/mentor-figure. I had no idea how nuts he was until the COVID vaccine started being talked about. It's really gotten out of hand. I can't do this anymore. I can't hear about how the vaccine has a microchip and something something Bill Gates cannibalism advocating for violence. Somehow Elon Musk is okay though.  


We share a common New Age religion (completely decentralized) and most people in it are completely on the Qoolaid. Being isolated with him, only interacting with others in this community, in a new city where I don't know anyone (COVID struck as soon as I came here) has brought us really close together. It's disorganized attachment, I know. He's always making me feel like I'm not good enough. He's always saying terribly homophobic/transphobic things (I'm trans) –– he sees me as ""one of the good ones"" and although I've MADE lots of progress with him on that front, everything else just keeps getting worse. He doesn't want me to engage in critical analysis of anything. He doesn't want me to stand up for myself. And the other coworkers/members of this community are worse. When I presented my grievances to him, he said he won't change.  


I'm aware that I'm describing a cult. It's just austere to the point of toxicity.  


I told him and the others in the community that I'm thinking of leaving. He said I'm either in or out, no in-betweens. So fuck it, out I choose. He wants me to hurry up and make a decision so he can take his crap and leave, but i've been stalling. I am leaving. I know I need to. But he says this is my last chance and there's no going back from this.  


I will be losing a family overnight, 2 days before my birthday. I do love him, despite all of this. I love our conversations on what we relate to but it caused me to go on a huge drinking binge to the point where I ended up in the hospital for dehydration...so now I won't even be able to drink on my birthday.

1820,Oh boy.... of all things why did my mom believe in these crazy conspiracies? I've lost her and now just want to move out when i turn 18.,"Hey guys I've been reading your posts and feel so happy I'm not alone with family believing this stupid conspiracy... i'm just done and idk what to do. I am 16 and I live with my single mother who is 53 that believes everything from everybody in power is Satanists, 7 days of darkness (whatever the hell that is) and ""demonic pedophiles"" to adrenochrome and that Covid is a lie, to even having dreams of ""saving the kids in the tunnels"" and of-course treating (and even saying MULTIPLE TIMES in PUBLIC) Trump as if he is the best president in the world and treats him like a god. At least cult members don't force you to wear ad robe and drag you along with it. It all started after my biological father and her went to court and she lost unjustly (he works in the courthouse and we had a scammy lawyer.. 2 and 2 together lol) and she just spiraled since. She was always spiritual and always a little ""out there"" with beliefs, and we got rid of cable for a Roku since it was cheaper (something I regret so much). She calls me ""close minded"" but I never really believed in any of it. She continued watching Youtube spiritual videos until she somehow stumbled on a Q video... thinking nothing of it I just nodded along and left her be not giving it any thought nor care. One video turned to two, to three, and now that is ALL her rec youtube, Twitter and personality is. I left her alone never caring, however she even started watchign it while I was downstairs instead of our usual Family Guy Bobs Burgers etc... that's when I realized that is ALL she watches, and ALL she does on her free time, even when we're together. These ""influencers"" are just as CRAZY as she is making her SO ANTIVAX THAT SHE WON'T EVEN ALLOW ME TO GET ANY NOT EVEN THE COVID SCARED OF THE FUCKING ""TRACKER"" LIKE SHES DOES NOT HAVE A PHONE! They believe every STUPID conspiracy you can think of and now my mom believes them to to the point shes scared to send me to school so im stuck online. Every time i try to talk to her she brings up another crazy theory like Michelle Obama and even (laugh w/ me now) Megan thee MOTHERFUCKING stallion is a man too! She gets all this information from other crazy ppl that I am sometimes FORCED TO WATCH w/ her that uses such deceptive language making US sound like the crazy ppl and that we are ""sheeple unaware,"" and Im worried cause this stupd info is actually making her scared to go out sometimes and hoard food. It has gotten SO BAD that when we were looking for a car, the poor car salesman had to hear her talk about getting prepared when ""shit hits the fan"" and when Hillary gets locked up and the nation go crazy (she litterally, not even exagerating, went on a tangeant for 10 minutes talking about this on the test ride) and all he could do was nod along to her disolusions just worried about the sale, and I was so embarrased. Worst part is this isn't the only time, but just one of MANY situations that I was forced to be there begging ppl don't think im associated with this Karen. I call her Karen because despte smoking like 6 ciggaretes a day and has heart problems she somehow beleives Covid is a ""myth"" and EVERYTIME were in public she ALWAYS complain ot the poor employees that ""this is fake Plandemic"" and again goes on tangeants whenever asked to put on her mask. In aldi one time she YELLED at the poor lady cleaning the carts and the cashier because she said you can't enter w/out a mask. I apologized to her when my mom wasn't looking but the insults thrown at her saying Dr. Fauchi is an idiot and said masks weren't necessary blah, blah, blah... she even got a poor cashier fired because he made an offhanded remark about wearing masks to keep others safe and... u guess it... called the manager pulling the ""Disability"" and ""problem breathing"" card. Its to a point im embarrassed to go in public w/ her as i dont want ppl to think her stupid and groundless delusions are mine especially when shes not even wearing a mask nad actually TOOK MINE AWAY so i'm FORCED to enter some stores without a mask. Everytime I try to change the channel she would make sure to finish her Q livestream or whatever first and save any videos to watch later (which she does for HOURS ALL NIGHT... I SWEAR I'M GONNA CUT SOMEBODY IF I HEAR THAT GODDAMN ""IM PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN"" SONG OR TRUMP RALLEY ONE MORE TIME) and when something else is on shes glued to her ipad reading tweets or watching the videos on their instead. shes slowly spreading this to her only friend and anybody she meets and i'm done. my mom was once a hipster, but now I just want to get away from her ASAP but i feel bad cause i'm the only person she has thats close to her (but wonder why). I'll miss the woman before Q and hope there's a cure for this ""red pill"" cult.:(  Thx for letting me vent and feel so much better i'm not dealing with these crazy ppl alone.",QAnonCasualties

She’s generally very much a saint to my friends, and is a sweet person, who would do anything to help someone else. Her giant downfall? She’s so utterly gullible. She’s always been on the republican side of politics, but she’s never really listened to conspiracies till recently. I don’t even know how she got into it honestly. Just, sometimes she’d start babbling stuff that made no sense. It started when Trump became president, and it just kept getting worse. I assume she fell in due to her being really gullible, as it’s so easy to get her to believe something. It took one video from some non-dietician that oranges were bad for the diet. One video. 

Now this whole QAnon BS is the only thing we disagree on, other than our political views. She gets all her sources from Facebook, and honestly, I don’t really know when it got so bad. Nowadays though she’s all in on it, saying they’re going to stop pedophilia, Epstein is still alive, Trump is going to go back into office, the Vatican is paying our politicians?? Basically anything that fits QAnon she believes. Just today she was mumbling something about Area 51, no doubt another Facebook thing, and I don’t think I can ever get her out?? It’s really straining me mentally, because I’m not a legal age I can move out, and she guilts me because I don’t want to listen to her.

She’s got a history of trauma, so everything she reads can be pretty harmful to her mental health and she’s withdrawn completely from so many people.

1824,After months I've finally said something,"Hi all. I've lurked in this community since it's inception pretty muc. Reading your stories and advice has been a massive comfort, so I really am grateful for this sub.

My Qdad got into all this in 2016. If you're from the UK like we are, you may be familiar with Operation Midland, otherwise known as the VIP Pedo ring with all information coming from a mysterious figure and 'survivor' of the child abuse, 'Nick'. 'Nick' accused many politicians and high up members of British society of being part of a VIP Pedo ring when he was a boy. 

Now in 2020, we know that after thousands put into police work for Operation Midland and countless innocent individuals lives turned upside down, Nick (Carl Beech) was a liar and fraud, who made all of these stories up and is in fact a pedophile himself. But that doesn't matter, the damage was done and my dad got hooked in. Pizzagate followed in 2017, and shortly after Q entered. 

My dad got progressively worse and worse. He wasn't taking care of himself, not sleeping or eating properly and was admitted into hospital for pneumonia. After that, his consumption did go down some, only to shoot back up during Covid. I love him so much, but I hate the way he speaks to me, how he thinks so little of me sometimes. Its just small remarks these days, but it's a constant reminder he's still in it.

Today, he informed me over text that I should use caution with the vaccine because it will make me infertile and can cause anaphylactic shock and he won't take it. I broke down on my partner crying while drafting a reply. My dad is a front line worker, old and has respiratory problems and asthma. He's primed for it. And I can't stop thinking he is going to die from it and all I'll say to myself for the rest of my life is 'why didn't you try and reach him? Now he is gone'. I have sent him a long message trying to reach him using love and worry I have, but I don't know. At least if he dies of this, I know I tried.",QAnonCasualties

Only they aren’t dead, they’re alive and well.  Just down the street or across town or maybe a few states away. But alive all the same.  

Eating and drinking, working and shopping, going on about their lives and we are left mourning the loss of what they were. 

At some point they were our loved ones, they made us laugh and feel comfort.  They cheered us at our games and celebrated our life’s big moments. But now, anything longer than 5 minutes together have us terrified and heartbroken.

My dad became a citizen when he joined the Navy. I am a first generation and I grew up here. I met my husband when I was at the peak of my life and we have been enjoying life since we met. We have been on countless adventures and have loved the life we have built. It hasn't always been cupcakes and roses, but we have worked our way through it all. I love that he has always tried to work through anything. He is from the south. I knew going into this relations over a decade ago that we would have very different views, but we could work out anything. 

I have always shied away from politics because it make me uncomfortable (my dad was a republican and mom democract). My husband voted for Trump. It was uncomfortable, but I could make my way through this. Forward to the 2020 election. He became increasingly erratic and started to quote Bible versus. I didn't think anything of it until it became an obsession. January rolls by and he gone. I didn't realize the extent of his involvement until someone told me about Anon and every Bible verse and quote and what he has been saying is directly in-line with what they are all about. He is adamant that Qanon is weird and that isn't him, but almost daily he comes up with fear mongering, conspiracy theories, and lies. He has been isolating himself, secretly talks to people in the bathroom, uses Telegram, and always has this far-a-way stare. He says that he is doing his research and just to give him some time.

1830,Falling down the rabbit hole and coming back,"I got into a 9/11 truther movement several years ago. I had never heard of conspiracy theory. I'm grateful I joined the group and even more grateful to leave...it was definitely a learning experience! I learned that cabal, global, media, bankers, new world order, NASA, elites, and any word with 3 parentheses...(((***)))... around it means Jewish. The antisemitism flew under my radar till I learned their code. I associated The Protocols of the Elders of Zion with the KKK and Nazi propaganda. I had no idea people still believed this! And then I met the flat earthers and heard about alien lizards. Being part of a conspiracy theory group is fun and addictive. Within a week I got about 1,000 new friends, and so many more likes and shares.  We all told each other about being ""woke"" and trying to inform the sheeple. I noticed that dissent from the party line is frowned on severely. 

I was in the group for a couple years. The social acceptance was so nice (I think its known as love-bombing in cults), and I met cool people from all over the world. (Many of us had the same experience and remained friends.) I was openminded at first, but the conspiracy theories stopped making sense. Not EVERYTHING can be a conspiracy, that's ludicrous. Several people posted a pic of first responders changing into protective gear, and claimed it was evidence they were ""crisis actors"".  

I had questions about the Iraq invasion and war on terror, but learned Bill Gates was injecting us with microchips instead.🙄 

They called everything a ""false flag"". A Palestinian friend posted that he was leaving the group over a Syrian ""false flag"" attack...that he had family in Syria and the group was lying, it was not a false flag with crisis actors. I texted him...told him I was confused. He explained the situation thoroughly (starting in the 70s...I got a history lesson!)  and I took notes and Googled it afterwards. My friend was 100% correct. 

I got tired of the nonsense and deleted most of them
We all had ""9/11 truther group"" frames on our profile pics. It was embarrassing to delete the frame and admitting I was fooled. I had no idea that silly theory was going to morph into QAnon.

Then QAnon came out and friends I've known for years started falling down the rabbit hole. I tried to explain how old these theories are and they just kept sending me videos. I started blocked everyone who posted this nonsense and noticed a correlation between wearing masks and concerns about evil cabals kidnapping kids. The 9/11 conspiracy theorists posted about everything from microchips to chemtrails to 9/11 fakery. (And the Rothschilds of course.😜) But the  Q theorists posted about masks being bad, and child trafficking. Over and over. No jokes, no cat memes, just masks and global pedophilia. I tried to explain how old this propaganda is, and how I had fallen for it too.  

I'm not sure why I chose to stop going down the rabbit hole. It just got too absurd. I never got to the point where I rejected science, but I got the feeling that rejecting science was part of the attraction. I think people want to believe it. Maybe it's the sense of intellectual superiority. They talk about being ""woke"" and not being enslaved by the elites like that means they don't have to pay taxes anymore. I'm amazed that the Facebook group with the profile pic frames could be probably some of the people who stormed the Capitol. I didn't see that coming!

What helped me leave was questioning their view of reality, and asking myself if it was valid. You really have to believe an incredible amount of nonsense to come to the conclusions of QAnon. 

Best of luck to everyone and their Qpeople!

1833,Qanon friends sound like stories from Jonestown,"


Five years ago when Trump began his campaign I was concerned immediately. Having read stories from Jonestown survivors and family members of lost loved ones, and being old enough to vividly remember Waco I asked my younger brother (who is a licensed psychologist) if this was cult behavior. His immediate response was yes. As time went by and actions got more and more frantic and the stories got more outrageous and unbelievable I would often need to him explain to me how and why these people could be such fervent believers. Now, after watching some people (friends and family) that I have known for years continue to carry this banner of conspiracy and fear, and seeing the reports and of violence I've made the decision to cut communication entirely until (hopefully one day) these people can get some kind of help. 
I don't know if that's the right thing to do but what I do know is that a lot of these people are honestly terrified right now because nothing that they believed would happen happened, and terrified people are dangerous people, as many of you know all too well now. It just seems right now and for I don't know how long in the future, that cutting communication off completely is the safest route.

1835,I want to cut contact to my brother,"Who is, of course, a Qanon believer.

We were never really close. We have a 3 year age gap and grew up together, I (28M) think my parents preferred me, and treated my brother unfairly sometimes. I don't think we had an awful childhood, but the tension between my brother and our father and our parents alcohol usage gave us plenty of bad memories. My brother was also bullied at school.

 I always thought i had to be careful with my words around him, but he got to be insensitive to me. Not to say i haven't been my fair share of asshole to him, but he never really took no for an answer. I also feel like all of my good memories of him have disappeared and everything is in a new, bad light and i'm feeling very sad for that - is there anything to be salvaged, really?

In our adult years we often argued especially over how to train pets. I vividly remember him kicking his dog and me getting a rush of adrenaline to run in and stop him. (He stopped before i got to pushing distance luckily, bc if we fought he would've probably kicked my ass) This is the most extreme memory of how he handles pets - but true. I've always been more of a softie, and I could've trained my dog better but they are not dangerous.

For a couple of years now, we've been mostly fighting at least every other time we see about Qanon stuff. It's gotten to the point I am really starting to truly hate him. I dread every time I see him, because he can be either calm-ish (probably smoked weed) or go spiraling raging about conspiracy theories. And I don't really even mind the theories - speculate all i care - but the way he talks is offensive to my core.

&gt;Example scenario;   
I am watching news with parents. He walks in, greets us.   
&gt;  
&gt;""Oh I see you're watching \*brand\* news! getting brainwashed nicely there?"" he says in an obviously mocking voice.   
&gt;  
&gt;""yeah"", i say, and i'm sure my tone gives off how much i was offended off that lol.   
&gt;  
&gt;Then he starts talking about how we are sheeps, we'll see and so on. 

I've tried arguing with him, but it is obviously useless because we no longer have any news outlet we both trust. There is zero common foundation. I've tried nodding and going ""yeah yeah"", but he can obviously hear i'm pretty pissed off and talks more. One time we talked for long and were really emotional. I thought we were making a pretty big breakthrough. He said that he just wanted someone to listen. Then he started talking about Michelle Obama, and how she is playing a man and that is somehow sick and pedophilic that she's playing a man. Well, I don't always feel comfortable with my gender, so that hit me pretty hard. I told him even if she was a man, i don't care, she can do what she wants and it means nothing. Well, my brother got angry, but he had to leave so the conversation kinda ended. But it still bothers me.

I've tried being silent as well, but i get to hear about ""no one listens, no one cares about me, open your eyes and stop believing the propaganda"" etc. 

Last time we saw, he came in and was obviously getting more and more agitated with what he was talking to our mom. I tried talking to him again (last time was calm and i was feeling hopeful) And yet, we ended up arguing about being a leader to the pets again. I admit, I was making assumptions about what being a leader meant based by what I did not agree with his pet keeping and therefore dismissed what he said. He then said i was delusional to think my dog liked me or we were friends. It was just last straw for me. (I know, after all those years of talking shit about everything I believe in, dissing me and my dog's relationship was the last straw lmao) 

I told him it really hurt that he said that.  
""well it hurt me too, when you said i'm crazy."" He said.  
I asked when was this, bc I don't remember. He didn't say but fair, i must have said that at some point bc i've been frustrated for years now. I apologized and said i did not believe so, but he did not believe me. As he didn't apologize to me at all, i think I just mentally said fuck it and started making really salty comments. We argued some before he left shouting he was the black sheep of the family, always causing shame, but we sheeps will have to wake up eventually etc.   
""shame never really slowed you down"", I said (unnecessary, i know...)

Afterwards I decided to cut contact immediately. But It's been a month and I've been sleeping bad just thinking about him. I think I have to confront him once more, because I know he is depressed and lonely. He's been self-harming before and talked about suicide. I want try to say once more, that I don't want to hate him, but I just get angry at the stuff he says. From now on I will leave immediately if I get angry at what he says, because I have no other way to handle it. And of course, I want to apologize for hurting him before. 

Even though I feel like i'd be better off and our relationship is hardly salvageable. I'm just so conflicted.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the main points you would say in a situation like this? So he doesn't get more agitated that I don't hate him, but what he says? Or advice for me, so I can persevere the comments he will probably make when i go see him? Or idk just some peer support i'm just so exhausted

1838,My aunt’s husband,"Hi there. I believe my aunt’s husband may be into QAnon and this is unsettling for me and other members of my family. If it matters, I’m thirteen (F). My aunt recently remarried to a man whom I’ll call J, and he seemed like a nice guy—he is a nice guy, just maybe not as nice as I thought he was.   


The majority of my family are conservative mormons (me, my mom, my dad, and my siblings are not along with a few others. they’re atheists and I’m a “closeted” pagan)  and they share beliefs like “all these kids are saying they’re gay for a trend” (which hurts a bit as I’m bisexual and I struggle with this a lot), “BLM is stupid and doesn’t make sense. White privilege doesn’t exist.”, “if girls wear certain clothing they’re asking for it. How can they expect men to control themselves?” And a lot of other really nasty things.   


Despite this, almost everyone in my family (I have a trump supporter aunt in America) dislikes trump. Even my extremely conservative grandparents (my grandma calls him evil). I wasn’t there during this but this is the scenario it was revealed J believes in conspiracy theories and trump;

&amp;#x200B;

J, my aunt, and my grandparents went out to dinner (along with my other aunt) and were having a nice time. Eventually, somehow, COVID-19 was brought up and randomly J (like completely unexpected) started going off about how the “media” is lying, the virus isn’t fake/doesn’t do this much harm, the election was fucked, trump is good, etc., and no one was expecting it. He’s never said anything like this before and it surprised everyone a lot (my grandma told him to ask god and she said god will tell him trump is a vile, evil man) but J was genuinely really riled about this. My conservative family members often talk about “”the left”” and how intolerable “”the snowflake left”” and this even shocked them.   


I’m scared he’s gotten into conspiracy theories about the government and such, and I’m worried he’s going to take my aunt with him. I can’t say anything to her about this because she’ll take my concern as an insult and I don’t won’t to be rude, especially as a kid. My aunt is kinda susceptible to conspiracy theories (she believed in the mcdonalds nuggets being made of pink goo) and things and I don’t want to lose her to this—and I don’t want her husband to lose himself to this. I think my aunt’s husband is a QAnon supporter and a conspiracy theorist, what do I do?   


He just kept going on and on about trump and how great he is. and how the “media” is spreading lies about it and all this really weird stuff. I don’t know what to do. It feels like the world is falling apart. I’m not in the US but I’m really prone to stressing about this stuff (mental illness unfortunately) and I can’t help but feel things are being torn apart and that J is going to poison my family with his conspiracies. Sorry for venting a little.",QAnonCasualties
1839,Qanon Ruined my Family,"I've been seeing a lot of stories on here and there seems to be a large community of people all sharing my situation, so here it goes. 

My mom is only 53 years old and has always been family focused. I am the oldest with 3 sisters (12,16, and 23). She has always been involved and super overprotective of her kids. When the Covid lockdown happened she found herself browsing facebook way more than usual with the free time, and thats when she was exposed to Q by some of her FB friends. Within two weeks of her discovery of Q she was getting even deeper into the child trafficking aspect of it and thats when things started to crumble.                     

She lost her drivers license somehow and was convinced someone from the ""Trafficking ring"" was targeting our house using the license because we were labeled as Trump Supporters. This was around Easter time of 2020, and it got so bad she was convinced there was going to be an event on Easter involving mass kidnappings of children and we were on the list. When she reveled these thoughts to me she even made me leave my phone inside because it could be used to listen to our conversation. I know my mom better than anyone and had no idea of any of the Q information, so I told her that in my opinion this was all false and after Easter she should feel better and we can move on. She even looked at me and said ""Danny, you know im not crazy"", and there really was nothing off in her personality she was just scared.. She then told me shes going to send my three sisters to my oldest sisters boyfriends house for Easter night and then she would feel better. Obviously making the biggest mistake of my life i went with it in hopes this would pass as quickly as it came, but I was very wrong.

Easter weekend comes my sisters are all together at the boyfriends house leaving my mother and step-dad left at the house. My step-dad informs me that she didnt even feel comfortable for them to be at the house for the same reasons, so they went and got a hotel nearby. The next morning i got a call from my step dad saying that my mom was gone from the hotel with her bag but the car was still in the parking lot. He already called the police before calling me. When i arrive at the hotel after promptly leaving work to begin helping look for her my step dad says a detective called back and wants to meet with us in the hotel lobby. 

The detective showed up and gave me life changing news. He told me my mother inflicting wounds on her wrists and neck, and was running from the police that were trying to help her. She ran into an apartment complex and dove into the lake to avoid the police. She then passed out due to blood loss and submerged into the water for a few minutes. She is now in a coma with devastating brain damage and is only alive because of the officer that dove in after her. She is still in the coma while i'm typing this today, and it has been very tough especially for my younger sisters.

My reason for sharing: Please learn from this story and realize mental heath is a serious issue and can spring up in people even if they have no history or show no signs up until its too late. Obviously a lot of people will comment on this and say many thing i should have done differently, but this was in a span on a week or so and I had no reason not to trust my mom or just believe its a quick phase during all the tough times going on in the world. If someone you know is hurting from any mental heath issues or is being overwhelmed with the lies of QANON, please dont just dismiss them from  your life, but see if theres anything you can do to bring them back to us.

1841,Separating from my husband,"Yesterday I told my husband he needed to move out. He has become increasingly hostile with me the past few weeks because I “don’t and won’t listen” to these theories. 

He started getting into conspiracies years ago through Project Camelot (is anyone else familiar with this?) but after losing his job last year the conspiracies have consumed him. It really blew up over the holidays when my parents asked us to get a covid test before visiting (my brother has been chronically ill for twelve years). Our marriage has just completely deteriorated since then.

He is so cold and unkind to me and also tries to blame me for his behavior because I haven’t woken up and he can’t talk to me about his beliefs, that he is worried about these things to protect us and he is concerned about the well-being of the world.

They can cause permanent brain altering effects and damage on people.

1843,When to cut off qarents?,"Hi everyone, loved finding this sub because no one else understands what this is like. 

My dad has completely lost it. He spends hours a day ""researching,"" and he comes up with all sorts of crazy shit. He was at the capitol riot and was definitely near the front even during the major pushes forward, even though he claims that he never went inside. I know what he does on social media, and it's all the usual Q shit, racist, antisemitic, vile. Even though my dad's grandkids (my kids) are both jewish and biracial. He thinks the world is ending, the new world order is coming, that he'll be ""genocided,"""" none of it makes sense and it's all frantic and bizarre. 

My problem is that no boundary is firm enough. Even if I hang up when he starts talking crazy about Biden being CGI and communist, a Chinese spy, part of the cabal- he'll do it again next time. Or he'll text me about it. I can't figure out if it's all he can think about (probably true) or if he's trolling me (probably also true), but either way it's so upsetting and terrible. I don't want my kids around him. I don't want my husband around him! But we used to be so close, he was a single dad and I was his oldest kid and we spent truly hours each day talking to each other. Even now he'll kind of mournfully ask when I'll visit next, even though I told him I'm being safe with covid and that I very deeply disagree with all the Q shit and he got mad.

1846,MIL stopped paying taxes; what will happen next?,"My mother-in-law fell into the QAnon umbrella right along with flat earth and a bunch of other things a few years ago. Long story short she is so far gone that if Jesus himself came down here and told her she's an idiot she'd call him a lizard person and tell him to do some research. 

She let everyone know that she stopped paying income taxes on her *state-provided job* (works for the department of traffic) lol. The irony is obviously lost on her. It was nice at Christmas because with all that extra dough she bought some really cool presents, but that's not the point. 

I just wonder whats gonna happen next. How long will it take for the IRS to pound down her door? How long will she eventually end up spending in jail? I 100% for a fact know she won't concede anything in court as she can be very argumentative and her first court cases will end with her being in contempt, I'm sure. I don't think she's violent as she's so damn sure of herself that she thinks she will win in court. 

She already had a court hearing recently where she spouted her sovereign citizen BS so the judge set up a new court date. Can't wait to see how that speeding ticket plays out after you've wasted the court's time.

1848,My Dad,"My brother and I both are extremely angry with my Dad for his QAnon beliefs.  Angry because we have lost so much respect for him, that he would be duped into following such utter nonsense, and then try to suck us into it.  Angry because he's poisoned two other siblings, my mom, and a brother in-law.  Angry because he wholeheartedly believes in ""the plan"" which includes the execution of thousands of people who are supposed enemies of America.  Angry and sad over the loss of a relationship that was built on mutual respect and admiration.  Sad that he spends his days watching video after video of conspiracy bullshit, falling into a deeper and deeper depression.

I am trying to remind myself though, that at the end of the day, the only person that I can control and be responsible for is myself.  No one has the power over my emotions but me, someone can't ""make"" me angry or sad, it is always a choice.  Being responsible for my own emotions means I can't be the victim here.  I feel like the alanon serenity prayer here is really important: "" God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, *courage to change the things I can*, and wisdom to know the difference.""  That's a hard pill to swallow for me, because I don't want my dad to be deluded idiot, I want us to have a ""normal"" relationship, and it feels very personal that he would choose to follow this stuff over a relationship with me.  I want to feel like I can trust him to be there for me when times are rough, but I don't trust his judgement anymore.  

I've been to counseling over this, and the most important thing I took away from it was that we have to mourn and grieve over these relationships if we want to see healing for ourselves.  We have to understand and come to terms with what we have lost.  My counselor has suggested that I make a list of the good things about my Dad, and also the things I've lost to grieve over.  Without apologizing for his behaviors and thought processes, I am trying to remember that he is just a person, flawed just like me, with a complicated life history.  

So here are some of the things I've lost (apart from anything above):  I can't call him with lifeprotip questions on how to fix something or figure out how something words, he is not there to share in my accomplishments and my struggles, I no longer feel comfortable to lean on him for guidance, family gatherings are a life sucking instead of life giving, there is a sense that I have lost some of my grounding or comfort in a crazy world, while my wife and I do well there is a fear about the loss of a safety net, he doesn't laugh anymore, joke around, or really enjoy life at all.  

Somewhere in that deluded mind though is the person that used to be my dad.  He laughed readily, was loud and boisterous, he can fix anything and has an amazing problem solving mind, he is like me in that he enjoys new experiences and is constantly tinkering with something new that is interesting to him, he enjoys food and drink a little too much just like me, he has comforted me in really hard times, he has been proud of my accomplishments and almost always supported my decisions.  He provided a safe home for me to grow up, put a roof over my head and food on the table.  He looked for ways to connect with me through shared experiences even when I knew they didn't interest him, that let me know I was important to him.

There's a lot more I could say good and bad about my dad, but thats a really good start.  I have to come to terms with the fact that I may never get my dad back from this.  I have to recognize that I cannot control him, and in some regards, the person I though he was is just an illusion in my mind.  I have to learn to accept who he really is while at the same time create boundaries for me and my family to stay healthy.  It is my sincere hope that each of you does the work to bring about personal healing and that you find peace, I certainly could use some too.  Please understand that I am not preaching to anyone but myself, these things are hard and maybe posting to this page will bring some sort of catharsis.  If this subreddit is something like QAnon-Anonymous, then consider this my first time sharing.  If I find healing, Ill let you all know.

1849,My father is pushing me towards suicide,"   **I should through a trigger warning here, I discuss self-harm and suicidal ideation, if you are struggling please don't read any further than this.**

&amp;#x200B;

   I (19F)  have been lurking here for about a week or so now and I think my dad has fallen for a lot of Qanon conspiracy theories. To make everything worse, in march I was forced to leave my job and stay in the house because of covid. My partner is now trapped with me as well as its the only way we can see each other is if we both are in my parents house. I can't see any of my friends, I can't go to college, I can't do anything anymore... I have been trapped here for so long. All the time my dad will pressure me to go onto hour long walks where he'll tell me the world is going to end and how Its not worth living anymore because of his theories. 

   He'd insist that I was so optimistic, I made him feel better. So I felt obligated to always go. Even though every time I got back it took every fiber in me not to plan a suicide method. It hurts to talk to him about all this Qanon bullshit so much. I hate hearing it, no matter how many times I told him to stop he'd just get all defensive and call me selfish for not wanting to hear it. He'll relate politics to absolutely everything, its nearly impossible to talk to him at all without him mentioning it.

   I guess to get a better context of this I should tell you I have OCD, my dad doesn't believe in mental illness and told my brother when he opened up about his depression that ""That's just an excuse liberals use to not do anything, get over it"". So I have never told him anything in this regard. If I do anything considered ""amoral"" in my mind I will never not feel guilty about it, it usually results in me starving myself and burning my self with a lighter and hot glue to punish myself. Recently I have been given advice for treating my OCD was to do more stuff for myself over time and stop taking responsibility for other people, so I thought it would be a good idea to go for a walk with just me and my partner.....

  So I am doing really bad now, on the day of the inauguration I went for a walk with my partner by ourselves just to try and get away and talk about other things. We had to ask my dad before we left that we are going for a walk. He insisted on coming but I knew it would be bad for me if he came so I kinda insisted in an assholish way that I just wanted to go with my partner this time... He took it really personally and afterwards he started telling my partner what a selfish horrible person I was for doing this. I feel so guilty but I can't listen to his crazy conspiracy theories any more, its killing me. Idk what to do anymore... moving out isn't an option as I ran out of money from not having a job and I can't get back my old job rn.

What do I do? I'm so lost and guilty its eating me from the inside out... He keeps guilting me about all sorts of things and its really hard to keep myself together... Sorry that was probably a lot to read but if you have any advice I would really be grateful.",QAnonCasualties

1853,"Out of nowhere, my QAnon parents called me to tell me that they’re “done with me”","My parents are lifelong conservatives, but that didn’t mean anything to me when I was a kid. When you’re a kid, your parents are always right. It wasn’t until I went to college in 2014 that I actually started to pay attention and form my own religious and political beliefs. When Trump ran for president in 2015, I was disgusted by him, but I didn’t take him very seriously. My parents, though, were all in. Whatever. I was disappointed but not surprised. After all, they’ve always disliked the Clintons.

But this wasn’t just simple partisanship. My parents basically worship Trump. Years back, when I still saw them regularly, we would get into arguments because I couldn’t understand how they thought that Trump represented Christian values. It was a waste of time. It was like talking to a wall. Things got worse.

At some point, my mom got into QAnon. I never talked about it with her, so I don’t know exactly how this came about or what her descent into this cult actually looked like. All I know is that she started sharing a lot of stuff online about “cabals” and the “deep state,” and how the Clintons are pedophiles and the “MSM is fake news.” Our relationship has been disintegrating ever since, although I’ve generally tried to keep things civil wherever possible. They’re my parents, you know?

But then the election happened, and the other shoe dropped. My parents knew for a fact that Biden stole the election. My mom replied to something Trump shared on Facebook, “Please keep fighting—martial law, perhaps?” My parents were in DC for Trump’s rally that led to the Capitol attack, although they didn’t participate in the attack itself. Still, they were sure to point out that it wasn’t MAGA people storming the building—it was “Antifa.”

I don’t talk to my parents about this stuff. It’s pointless. I do, however, share my opinions online. I tweeted/retweeted some anti-Trump/anti-GOP stuff, and my parents didn’t like that.

About two weeks ago (give or take) I got a call out of the blue. The last time I’d talked to my parents was around Christmas and things seemed fine. They sent me and my fiancé presents. But it was my dad on the phone. He said, “Hi. Mom is with me. We just got back from DC. We’ve seen the stuff you’ve been tweeting, and we’re done with you. You’re not getting another fucking cent from us.” I got mad and told them they’re in a cult, and they hung up on me. Then they immediately cut off my cell phone service.

I found out after that they lied to my siblings about what happened. Apparently all they told my brother was that they called me and I cursed them out so they hung up on me. Now my only contact with them is lurking their Facebook pages, where my mom is posting stuff about how Kamala’s inauguration outfit is a sign of Revelation.",QAnonCasualties

1856,No where else to turn,"Hi Guys, 

I’ve never even used reddit before but while searching for Q anon support this is all I was able to access.

My husband is a republican and I am a Democrat. Has never been an issue in our lives until a few months ago. We just don’t talk politics much. We both agree with things on both sides most of the time. 

2 months before the election my husband began coming home, leaning against the kitchen sink and drinking 20-25 beers in a 2-3 hour span while “researching” on his phone. At this point he is not “voting for trump but 3rd party” and does not agree with Q. It became a major issue with the drinking and obsession. We made a deal on the new year he wouldn’t drink at all in January and stop “researching”. Things were going great, until the capitol went down 🤦‍♀️ Then he started drinking again and is now full blown admitting hes a Q member and continues to just tell me to “wait and see”. The date in which I “will see” has been extended multiple times. It’s taken over our life, relationship, and relationship with his children. I can’t go on like this.

Members that were apart of Q and realized it was not a true or healthy situation, what finally changed your mind? What helped you release yourself from this situation? Any advice is welcome. He is truly such a smart and amazing human but is struggling hard and completely brain washed.

1864,Has anyone considered getting professional help for their qPerson?,"If my dad woke up one morning and declared himself the king of england and was unable to perform basic daily functions or go to work because of this dellusion, I would call and have him committed on an involuntary psychiatric hold.  No one would accuse me of ""trying to silence him"" or think I was being vengeful or had some other ulterior motive.   Its clear that he can no longer care for himself, maintain a job, form social connections and could possibly be dangerous if confronted about these delusions.

Why are we treating qPeople differently? 
If their dellusions about baby eating satanic cabals are interefering in their ability to fucntion in society (and in some instances care for dependents), work or care for themselves - they need help. 
Maybe people need to consider (with non Q fanily members &amp; friends) if its in their loved ones best interest to have them evaluated.

Im not saying we should lock up everyone who believes in Q in the crazy house.  Im specifically concerned about the ones whose beliefs in Q are so extreme they are no longer able to care for their kids, care for themselves, hold down a job, pay their bills or are a danger to themselves or others (stopped paying mortgages, taking medication, neglecting their kids etc).  And Im just suggesting an evaluation and temporary hold.  

At the very least it gets them off the internet and cable news for a few days, so they can reflect on things away from the feedback loop and under supervision.  

Its not something Im suggesting lightly.  I think people should really sit down with other family &amp; friends and make the decision together, so no one person is to blame.  Not an intervention with the person bur sort of like you would when considering what to do about an alcoholic or drug addict &amp; the family gets together and decides whether or not they think their qPerson needs help. And then get that person help.

Ive read a few stories about people who got out of it on their own, do we know if anyone has tried getting professional help for their qPerson, what kind of help it was and if it worked? If enough people are sent to get evaluated or treated, psychiatrists can find what works best and maybe offer better solutions that wouldnt require committing them.  Or maybe committing them works by just getting them off the internet for a few days.  

We seek professional help for our loved ones all the time for addiction and mental illness, how is this different? If their delusion was anything else we'd have called for help.  We can all agree the guy running around the wal mart parking lot naked with an eye patch that thinks he's a pirate and confronts people about ""stealing his treasure"" is mentally unstable and needs an evaluation.  Why don't we think people neglecting their kids (or losing their jobs) in lieu of spending hours online because they think its the only way to get their country back from the satanic baby eating cabal deserves the same help as naked walmart pirate? 

They're unable to tell the difference between reality and their delusion and in doing so fail to understand the real world consequences of their action resulting in harm to themselves &amp; their loved ones.

We haven't found it beneficial to go down the rabbit holes with her because there is an explanation for everything. Full quote below:

""The madman's explanation of a thing is always complete, and often in a purely rational sense satisfactory. Or, to speak more strictly, the insane explanation, if not conclusive, is at least unanswerable; this may be observed specially in the two or three commonest kinds of madness. If a man says (for instance) that men have a conspiracy against him, you cannot dispute it except by saying that all the men deny that they are conspirators; which is exactly what conspirators would do. His explanation covers the facts as much as yours. Or if a man says that he is the rightful King of England, it is no complete answer to say that the existing authorities call him mad; for if he were King of England that might be the wisest thing for the existing authorities to do. Or if a man says that he is Jesus Christ, it is no answer to tell him that the world denies his divinity; for the world denied Christ's.""

I broke with my fiance of 10 years (we were living together since 8 years) almost 4 years ago because basically he was already showing the Q-mindset, believing all the ridiculous propagandas, whatever it was.

Even tho my feelings for him (tenderness, care, deep affection, love) didn't change at all, i started questioning my life with him, as i was slowly realizing we didn't have anything in common, that i was feeling ashamed of letting him talk in public about his brand new beliefs, that i was constantly bored of listening and watching that stuff, that it wasn't possible to debate anything based on science, because ""official science is part of the deep state""...well, you know all of that shit.

We've been away for just 1 year, then the affection we have for each other kept getting us closer again. The problem is that he's worsened, he's obsessed, watches and talks about conspiracy theories 24/7, he says we are enemies now (calling me after half an hour like if anything happened), he's a Trump supporter (we are Europeans...), he's against 5G, he's antivax, he's sure of the ""great reset"", he hates masks (but when we go out together he uses it) etc.

My question is: my love for him really isn't affected by his fucked up mind, he's more than family to me, he's sweet, cute, adorable, he cares about me lots, he's always treated me like a princess, but my attraction for him is long gone because i really am afraid he's not intelligent, he's an easy prey for those cults, he wanna feel more intelligent than others that's why he's prone to believe in ANYTHING different, without questioning it, because he can't, he doesn't have the tools nor the mental resources to do it.

1871,My Daughter,"My daughter was sexually abused by her father when she was a teen. This past year she found out he did the same thing to her step sister. She has been on a downward spiral since. 
She had already been talking about how high power people in music, Hollywood and politics were part of a sexual abuse and trafficking ring. She mentioned the use of pizza imagery used by those involved. She said that the guys at work had shown her videos as proof. 
Before the election, when Hunter Biden's laptop was allegedly turned over by some computer repair guy, she called me about videos that were on it that allegedly showed Hunter Biden  and Joe Biden sexually abusing Joe Biden's grand daughter. She was flipping out while telling me that she watched the videos and that it was true. She said that anyone not believing it were,also the same people that did not believe her about her dad. 
I have believed her about her dad &amp; have been there for her and supported her this whole time. Her dad's wife denies it, blames the girls and went as far as to go tell my daughter to fuck herself with a cactus. Her dad and his wife are QAnon supporters, go figure.
My daughter has also become extremely absorbed with this guy she has been seeing. He plays head games with her and every time she does something he doesn't like or gets pissed off at her, he eitjer ghosts her or breaks up with her (the last time he went as far as to tell her he hates her). She has attempted suicide twice when he has done this and once she called the sexual abuse hotline because of everything with the sexual abuse and her boyfriend leaving her. Things she told the representative on the hotline made them want to send someone out for a welfare check. Her boyfriend went to jail over the summer for 3 months. Since he's been out, he hasn't gotten a job and my daughter has depleted her savings supporting him. Unfortunately this is also affecting my 7 year old grandson since he has been home with her twice during these episodes. She is going to counseling now but I'm worried that if she brings up the QAnon stuff and they try to debunk it, she will stop going. I'm not sure what part her boyfriend plays in encouraging her belief in the QAnon stuff or how deep it goes. We don't see much of her anymore because of how wrapped up she is with this guy. The only time I hear from her is if she needs something or he broke up with her for the umpteenth time. I haven't seen my grandson since Christmas. Luckily he does spend a lot of time with his dad during the day and on weekends so his exposure to the chaos is slightly limited. Unfortunately when my grandson is with my daughter, her boyfriend is always present and takes priority over him. My grandson spends most of his time with her on his room playing on his Xbox. He acts out and has said he is angry with my daughter. 
My son has also told me that he has witnessed them using lots of coke when he has hung out with them and he thinks that their drug abuse is also contributing to my daughter's decline.",QAnonCasualties

1873,Found out my brother and his wife are expecting their first baby and are deep into QAnon all on the same day,"Literally coming out of Reddit hibernation to post this (my first post in two years!)

Yesterday morning my brother called me to tell me that he and his wife are expecting a baby. I was ecstatic! He is my only sibling, and this will be my first niece/nephew. It was a happy phone call, and I spent most of the day happily texting my parents and talking with my husband about the new baby.

Then around 8 PM, I got a text from my cousin. This cousin and I aren't especially close as he's quite a bit older than me, but we've always gotten along well. He and my brother were very close growing up, and my brother was the best man at my cousin's wedding.

The text just said ""Did you know [brother] is deep into QAnon????""

I was shocked. I've always known that my brother and his wife swung more conservative than me, which I was fine with, though I did think it was a little weird based on our upbringing (our parents are old hippies - our mom hasn't watched TV in about 25 years and only listens to NPR and Bob Dylan, and our dad only watches nature documentaries on PBS). I didn't know it ran this deep, though.

In talking more with my cousin, I discovered that my brother and his wife and very deep into the QAnon/Breitbart/Fox News world. They support the insurrection on the White House and believe the election was stolen. I also learned that my cousin and my brother haven't spoken to each other in almost a year, as my cousin went no contact with my brother after a previous conversation about this stuff.

My brother and I aren't super close either, but we do chat occasionally and I love him very much. There's a big age gap between us, and he moved out of the house when I was in early middle school. When we do talk, it's never about politics. We mostly talk about shared interests, like video games and science fiction books.

Mostly I just feel sad. I love my brother, but he's always been very impressionable. I feel sad that he has been lied to and tricked. I feel sad that this is marring how I feel about the upcoming birth of my niece/nephew. 

My husband asked what I was going to do, and I decided that for right now, nothing. My brother has not brought up these beliefs to me or our parents. If it remains that way, I think that we can still have an ok relationship. I'm mostly just going to do my best to love this baby even more, and try even harder to be a part of their life.

1875,Embarrassed to be seen in public with my husband,"Who else here has this issue?

My husband believes in pretty much all of the conspiracies promoted by Q, but not Q itself because Q isn't extreme enough. His issue with Q is that Q supported Trump, but he believes Trump is part of the deep state due to his support of the COVID vaccine. 

For months I have been doing my best to avoid going anywhere with my husband. He is strongly anti-mask, and will deliberately break the rules. I live in Germany where people (and the law) take this very seriously, so it is particularly embarrassing. I'm also of course concerned about him getting a fine or getting into legal trouble. 

I refuse to go anywhere with him unless he wears a mask where required. Until recently he used a bandana in place of a mask, but now that is no longer legal here, so the issue will probably get worse. Even with the bandana, he would do stuff like deliberately pull it down when he thinks I'm not looking. He will also make comments about my mask wearing (saying that I don't look good in it, or trying to convince me to take it off), and will also bother our teenage son about it. 

 I feel like I am babysitting a toddler rather than interacting with my spouse. In addition to the mask stuff, he has talked about conspiracies publicly when I have asked him to stop. He will also sometimes point to ads and try to describe some nonsensical hidden agenda he thinks they are promoting. It is really embarrassing for me, and I don't want to be associated with it. At this point I am even refusing to talk about this shit in private, so hopefully it won't be an issue in public either, but I'm concerned that it will still come up sometimes.

The problem is that he feels like he is being a hero by standing up to tyranny. I keep trying to explain to him that the people who observe him will not realize that he he is trying to protest, and instead just think that he is being a selfish asshole, but he just doesn't get it.",QAnonCasualties
1876,Today I have to tell my Qdaughter that she and our grandson are no longer welcome in our home. I'm devastated.

She's mentioned before that she's an anti masker and can't wear masks because of childhood trauma (we adopted her later in her life). She's been willing to compromise with us up to now.

We are Canadians living in Canada if that matters to the story. Currently under lockdown.

She's firmly entrenched in the Q beliefs and the more stress she's under the more she digs in. As a single mom she is under a lot of stress. We try to be there for her and approach her ideas with love and compassion.

During most of last year we participated as grandparents remotely and encouraged her to have a social bubble that included our grandson's best friends. That seemed to work out well. 

At Christmas we relented after they both tested negative and we've been their bubble. It's been good for them to have us in their lives. She has a new job where she works a lot of nights so we have our grandson four or five nights a week. 

I am unwilling to put myself or my husband at risk so today when she comes to pick up her son    I have to tell her she's not welcome, and because she's not welcome, neither is her son. Husband is willing to go no contact over this and is one step away from filing for custody or calling Children's Aid.

1882,Qanon has effectively discredited every ‘conspiracy theorist’ for the foreseeable future,"I found out about Q a few years back before it gained the traction it has now.

I’ve read many posts here and I sympathize you all, I get it, but a kind and humble word of advice going forward;

There are people out there who have experienced things that most people will dismiss as crazy, and those things are very difficult to talk about and open up to someone with if they are actually genuine experiences.

1884,My church is trying to red pill people,"Second situation - this one involving the church I go to. 


((TL;DR (for my last post):  Uncle is subscribed to Q-theories (most likely) without realizing it, is quite argumentative towards me even when I try to seem uninterested or say things as gently as possible. Also, he basically thinks Covid is less lethal than the flu. ))


I have been attending this church since I was ten-years-old, and while I never really truly believed what they were telling me, I felt like everyone was a close-knit family. Besides me being an occasional smart-ass in the youth group, I didn’t act-up in church. People believe in different things, that’s totally fine, and it was a church, so really it was expected. That was until about five years ago.


We had an amazing children’s pastor, who I’ll call “C”. C was my pastor when I attended Sunday school, he had this level of excited energy that made all the repetitive, boring stories in the Bible bearable. He was very approachable, very personable, and was creative with each and every lesson he taught us.


Then he came out as gay. And, because my main pastor (who will be referred to as P) wanted to remain on good terms with the missionary church, fired C from his position as the children’s pastor, but allowed him to remain as a church member if he wanted. He (understandably) didn’t.


At the time, I (I was probably around 14, at the time) was deeply saddened but it never really struck me how homophobic that action was. Other people soon left the church because of said decision. Last I heard C has a boyfriend and is living his best life.


Skip to four years later, a couple of months before the election, P started a sermon series on Revelation. Which, on its own, is manageable to listen to. Expect he kept adding in little phrases like unbelievers will be left here to suffer with such glee in his voice that it made me feel very, very sick. I am an unbeliever and I can put up with a lot, but I really started feeling attacked. But I rationalized that this is their religion and remained quiet. 


Skip to a few weeks ago. P went full Q. He started the sermon off by talking about John the Baptist (totally normal), then it quickly diverted into an ad for Q-anon. If I remember correctly the entire sermon went something like this:

- Normal sermon
-Showed us a  clearly edited video of Black Lives Matter protesters rioting with overlapping audio of various news channels saying that they are peaceful protestors. 
-Tried to imply that those protestors and Antifa were responsible for the Capitol riot. (I said it wasn’t Antifa under my breath and T got super pissy with me for the week afterward).
- Basically said that Covid wasn’t a threat. (I and a handful of people are the only ones who wear a mask.)
- Went on a twenty-minute tirade about the impending blackout. And kept going on-and-on about how Trump is trying to save us all.


This Sunday:

- Normal sermon
-The WHO and the World Financial something is in bed together.
 - Christians are so oppressed in the US.
- Antifa is bad :( And is being paid for by George Soros (why haven’t I got my paycheck yet, George?)
- Fact-checkers are, of course, paid for by the CCP and Soros. 
- Whined about Parler being shut down.
- Said that scientists now say the big bang never happened.
- Covid is being used to take away the freedom of speech.
- Said the Paris Climate Accord includes forced abortion (or something to that affect). 
- Repeatedly mispronounced snopes as snipes. I know it’s minor but it drove me insane.
- Said he wouldn’t discuss any of this with us unless we did our research/homework (with the smuggest smile). 
- Said the PCR (and the rapid) test for covid is 75 percent false positive. (Which I found no evidence of)
- Mentioned project Mocking Bird and tied that to Covid coverage.

My uncle, t, hangs onto every word. Believes that all of it is true (he’s believed in it before P brought it up). I’m expected to remain respectful, but if I bring up how the sermons make me feel I’m shut down.

I’m 18 (senior in high school) and I usually go to help my aunt with my cousins. But even when they don’t come with us or only one of them does, I still have to go and no amount of begging will change their minds. I have tried instituting a family game night in place of church, but my aunt still won’t budge. Apparently my thoughts and feelings on anything don’t matter. Me and my aunt use to be so close, but in the last year or so she rarely takes my side on things, is quick to blame me, and won’t really listen to me or will tell T what I tell her.

1885,My Uncle is slowly getting worse,"I am so happy I found this group! I have two separate, but intertwined, situations involving Q conspiracy theories.


The first involves my uncle, who I will refer to as “T”. Now, I have lived with my aunt for years before she met and eventually married “T”. Besides me being a little uneasy (due to previous negative experiences during my early childhood), I thought “T” was a good guy. And, for the most part, he is. He got me into the Marvel-extended Universe, and we bonded over half-formed theories. I knew from the beginning that our views were drastically different. I’m a leftist atheist, while he (along with my aunt) is a staunchly-conservative Christian with a very fundamental view of the world. 


This wasn’t really a problem until a couple of years ago. We had a mutual understanding that we don’t discuss politics or religion with one another. Then something switched. Every so often it’s like he can’t control himself properly when conserving with me - and it usually comes out of left-field. 


For instance, one time I told “T” and my aunt that we shouldn’t be eating out during the pandemic (I’ll explain more at the bottom), and my aunt just brushed me off. But my uncle started getting irrationally angry. Our conservation went something like this:

T: So, do you just want all the small businesses to go out of business?

Me: No, but-

T: Let. Me. Talk.

Me: But...over 200,000 people have died. 

T: Those numbers are inflated, it’s been proven.

Me (starting to shutdown emotionally): No.

T: You are so brainwashed, you need to stop watching CNN so much-

Me (trying not to cry): I don’t-

T: Yes you do. You are so brainwashed. God, (my name), you are so smart I don’t understand how you fell for all of it. 


My aunt stepped in then. I pointedly ignored him for the rest of the meal, even making a point of putting my mask back on after I was done eating. He texted me an apology awhile after we got home, I told him it was okay because I felt like it was expected of me.


Meanwhile, I disagree with him on something minor. For example, if anyone remembers that picture of three native Americans (I can’t remember if their tribe(s) were mentioned) flipping off Mount Rushmore. He got all huffy one day saying that if “they” (clearly thinking that they were Mexican) didn’t like it here then they should leave. When I (gently) pointed out that they were natives, he got super angry. Saying that they should respect our founding fathers. Telling him that they had every right to flip off the mountain did very little to assuage his anger, and after mumbling under his breath he went outside. Of course, according to my aunt and uncle, it was all my fault. 


And, it’s not always like this. Before he quit his job he paid my phone bill, which I really, really appreciated. But as I get older, more opinionated, it feels like he’s starting to grow resentful of me.


I know I said had two (intertwined) situations, but this post is already long. Not that anyone cares, but I’ll post the other situation separately. 


((Quick explanation about why on earth we were eating out during the pandemic: so, my aunt wanted us to get family pictures taken. We just got custody of my little cousins (aunt’s sister’s kids) and she wanted to get some nice photos taken. Everything was socially distanced, not busy at all, and masks were worn when not having pictures taken. Afterward, “T” mentioned that he was hungry and (after a long while) came to the conclusion that he wanted to eat at this one restaurant in Lapeer, Michigan (can’t remember the name). They were packed. I tried to keep my thoughts to myself, but upon seeing everyone (including staff) either not wearing masks or wearing them in a way that makes them useless, I couldn’t keep it to myself.))

The description:

&gt;This event was recorded on October 21, 2020. As part of our ongoing series on defending democracy from unethical manipulation, we are honored to bring you a very special 90 minute program explaining what's behind the QAnon movement. We looked at where it came from, its true nature, and how it might end safely.    
&gt;  
&gt;At its root, the scheme functions as an authoritarian cult. Through that lens, it can be properly understood as being based in a crisis of connection. During this pandemic, when so many people are feeling disconnected and off-balance, we are all more susceptible than ever to undue influence and unethical manipulation. We'll look at ways we can become more resilient against it.    
&gt;  
&gt;This program, featuring alternate reality gaming expert Jim Stewartson, cult expert Steven Hassan, multimedia journalist Desiree Kane, in conversation with TEDxMidAtlantic co-curator (and disifnformation specialist) Dave Troy offers a broad overview of the networks involved — with clear-headed ideas about how this destructive movement can be ended safely.

&gt;Among the areas covered: QAnon has its roots in the internet puzzle ""Cicada 3301""; that a network of former disgruntled military and intelligence professionals has collaborated to lend the scheme legitimacy; that various people involved are connected to a 1930's cult called ""I AM""; that many people involved with QAnon were also involved in the 2011 ""Occupy"" protests and NODAPL protests at Standing Rock in 2016-2017 — and even connected to the makers of the 2020 disinformation film, ""Plandemic.""

The video is around an hour and a half. The discussion talks about how to help people caught in Q starts at around the 1:13:00 mark, but it is definitely worth watching the preceding hour to give important context to the advice.",QAnonCasualties
1887,"This is the place I never thought existed, but I needed.","This will be long, but this is the story of how I've seen my mother deteriorate throughout the years. 

I'm a female, 19 years old and hispanic so to speak. 

My mother has always been a kind person, and I believe she still is, but in the wrong places. 

She was somehow normal when I was a kid, until I was 5 and my 3 year old brother got diagnosed with Autism (SEVERELY) which means he can't talk and acts like a child. Of course he got better, but the situation has gotten more difficult now that he's a big 17 year old teenager. 

I remember her feeling dread and blame for not noticing earlier and since then, I've lost my mother for most things, my normal life was over. 

She was still there for like making me good grades (despite the verbal abuse), but when it came to being with me at school with other parents, I was the only one responsible kid with no parents present. (My dad worked on the day, and he as well stopped caring about me when I grew up more, and became a verbal/emotional abuser.) 

So from now then, everything I did about myself besides schoolwork was all taught by myself and even if it did (and still does hurt!) I'm grateful for it, because otherwise I would be a brainless inmature set into millions of cults. 

As I was saying, my mother seemed normal and I think she deteriorated a bit because of my father's verbal abuse, but I believe she held it together because of us. 

(Note: Religion has made left her brain rot enough for her to marry the first fuckboy she found. NEVER DO THAT) 

My brother got diagnosed with autism and everything fell apart. No more normal family reunions, and no more family shared attention ans my mother's future as a social worker... crushed.

I remember that when I was like 10 or 11 (at that time we got our first laptop) and she found this thing called MMS. A ""Miracle"" Mineral Solution (It also goes by other names in order to avoid law) ... 
It's industrial bleach. (If not to say the whole name of that crap since I don't remember it) 

The way this shit is described it's like a fucking utopia, like finding a 4 leaf clover or a third testicle on  a dog. It even says that solves depression! (Which is like, y'know... A mental disorder! That at rare times it's genetic! So... Wtf!!!) And to be honest, at first I believed it (I was young, I had naive mind!) But this thing set her up for a belief that vaccines only cause illnesses and that the pharmacy is only a business. (Which it is, but not like how they paint it!) 

Guys... You need to know how easy this shit gets spread. My mother was the first, now most of my maternal family believes this bullcrap. 

Imagine the pain, when I realized that this thing only did harm. That the ""parasytes"" my brother was leaving on the toilet were actually his guts. That the times I saw him scream weren't normal gastric reactions, but him in pain... My heart shattered. (My mom doesn't give it to him because of the pain, but still believes in it!) 

Autism is not a sickness. It cannot be cured. It's a neurological condition that it still doesn't have any explanation of how it appears. (but I have a theory that it might be related to genetics) Autism cannot be caused by vaccines by that simple statement if we want to keep it simple.

She believes in those things... Out of desperation. And that's the thing of cults, they take the most desperate and turns them into monsters. They're villians that think they're doing good, that they're heroes. Just like in fictional media. Art tends to reflect reality. 

And what's all that for? For an actual evil profit that does exist unlike the ones they believe, but they choose to ignore it because their brains have been so washed that they could even suck their cult leader's dick if asked to. 

My mother is a hardcore christian, daughter of a pastor, most of her young days as a kid and a teenager were on a church. ALMOST EVERY DAY and even in the most ridiculous times like... STAYING ALL NIGHT DOING RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES WHEN THE KIDS HAD SCHOOL!

So... by that you get the idea of how my maternal family is. 

I was 12, many questions were rising in my mind. Questions that I did ask before but no logical answer has been giving to me, like that one time when I was 6 and asked my mother for the creator of god. (I eventually found my answer when growing up, and she won't like it when she finds out I'm an atheist.) 

2011-2012 was a good but weird era on the internet. Especially by all those conspiracies about the world ending. Back then a huge conspiracy was out and it was the one about the rapture, that Obama was going to microchip us with a rice sized chip, because he was the antichrist.  

There was also a rumor related about where I live that a tsunami was coming. 
Never happened.

In the middle of my questioning, I knew that was it. I tried to excuse the misogyny and homophobia of the bible, the lack of humanity and empathy that is deep thrown into most hardcore christian minds. This whole thing was just sounding crazy to me. 

That was the end of it, and by then... I realized I was an atheist and a bisexual... Seven years later and it's still the same. 

My mother, still a conspiranoic, was still somehow NORMAL, and that's talking like a fucking ton, because... Jesus Christ. 

My mother went crazier and crazier... Donald Trump was elected president and things got worse, but not completely. 

I'm from Puerto Rico, and I still remember that day where a hurricane struck us by, leaving all of us without water and electricity. It was September 21, 2017 and I remember that everything shut down at like 5:00 PM. 

I knew my mother liked Trump because of his beliefs, and I didn't care because the cult wasn't as big back then and tbh I didn't like Hillary either. (And I still don't, I think her whole thing was a facade to appeal millenials, but she's a Clinton nevertheless. A woman that got cheated on by her husband and is still married with him and that's a feminist figure? Bitch please!) 

It was until after so many weeks of our island pleading for help (as much as USA hates it, we still are a colony to them so we better get some treatment too) and Trump came by... said some bullshit and mocked us by throwing a roll of napkins at us. (Which it was like a very wanted thing back then because the supermarkets were empty.) 

He didn't do anything responsible, he just threw that at us. As if we were monkeys on a cell and he was throwing peanuts at us. From that day I never liked him.

People died from this! 

My mother excused his behavior as him trying to be funny. 

Señorita, this is a president we're talking about, if I wanted some cheap bad jokes, I could've just asked for a clown. Even so, this is a serious situation, people are dying... We don't need insensitive jokes of ""dark humor"". We needed help.

And he failed us. 

Also he tried to sell us to another country (I believe it was Greenland) because we were ✨disgusting✨.

... It's 2020, march... Coronavirus is confirmed as a pandemic. From that moment I just knew... That my mother would engulf herself into conspiracy theories out of desperation.

I wasn't wrong. 
The anti-vaxx and msm bullcrap came back. The whole JFK JR being alive too... (And a republican!? Him!? The son of one of the most iconic democrat presidents ever!? PLEASE...) Pizzagate... The whole Adrenochrome thing... 

Yes, I believe there are some weird ass people that drink blood. I know some things from pizzagate were accurate (but those were basically common knowledge?) 

And even if so, if those were real, I can't do anything against it. I'm an ant in a big colony with the rest of them. Worrying and getting in depth into that it's stupid. 

They call us sheep, when in reality they're the sheep that don't like when the mass majority are normal people living in reality. 

She then came to say that the election was a fraud, and that Trump was about to apply Martial Law. 

And... well... it's so stupid? These bitches are really scared of socialism or communism, but making such movement is a dictator one! (I wouldn't be surprised if it was Trump, the guy who is besties with Putin and Kim... THANK GOD HE'S GONE)

My mom stopped watching normal things, to watch YT videos of boomers talking about politics, even streams... Going to the living room is intolerable now. 

I'm scared for my little sister, she's 11... And she's being plugged in with all of this bullcrap... Children shouldn't have any idea of politics... Back then I was just idk... watching My Little Pony and scratching my boogers? 

I really hope she doesn't grow up to be a fascist... 

My father (besides me) even though he's a homophobic misogynistic piece of crap, he still has some braincells, and unlike my mother, he believes in masks and is willing to get the vaccine. When he tries to tell her otherwise, she just screams at him and insults him. 

I even remember him saying: ""You just always think that you're right! That you're so woken up! When you're not! You believe into everything this guys say without any evidence!"" 

I never thought in my life, to trust more my beliefs with the man that has mentally and verbally abused me in my life. Yes, she has gotten THAT toxic, and probably this might be something I could probably finally have in common with my father.

The fact that now... I am more scared of sharing my beliefs to my mother, the one that has almost defended me most of her life than my father, the man who had abused me mentally, never apologized for it and is now my sudden trigger when I hear his voice louder than usual is... baffling. 

It's scary how manipulative and convincing my mother is... How she spreads easily this information onto anyone and they just eat it up so easily (unless they pretend) It's ironic, how she's a latina black woman that believes in Trump. (And of course, dislikes BLM, ANTIFA... And even had the nerve to say that the whole ""I Can't Breath"" movement was fake and that the guy was actually arrested for drugs, and even still did deserved it because he has porn videos on pornhub and he's ""disgusting"". 

(It's also funny that when I explain a movement without saying it's name, she actually believes in it! It happened when I explained her ACAB without context) 

Many people from the right wing are dumb, many of them are there because it only benefits them, many of them are there because they think that's the right thing... and contrary to popular belief, they're highly intelligent... but use the brain for the wrong stuff.

My mother thinks that she's doing good, but she's a bad person in her beliefs that do more harm and good. 

It makes me somehow glad she didn't had an opportunity to be a social worker. 

These people are lawyers, doctors, engineers... people that believe so blindly something such as trivial as QAnon (To be honest, that sounds like something out of 4chan, and if it was, I wouldn't be surprised.) 

My mother, the one who once said: ""Don't believe anything on the internet."" Now believes anything that doesn't come from actual good sources thanks to how Trump has poisoned.

My mother, who once said: ""It's okay to believe in some conspiracy theories"" now says ""All conspiracy theories are real, and them calling us conspiranoics is a way to downgrade our preachings.""

As a last thing to say, even though maybe some more will come later, but this has been for two long and I think I have been typing this from like 2 hours... 

These people... have always been there in our society, but they were hiding. Trump came in and opened their doors. It's time (and it's something that Biden cannot fix, just time and good choices in future elections and years) to close those doors again, to normalize, shaming these people for their behavior. 

All of them, despite their good intentions that they think they're actually great, are all deep hatred ones, selfish. They're showing more now, because the world is evolving from those beliefs, they're desperate, and they're scared and they believe in these cults because it makes them feel validated, with a purpose and actually intelligent. (I know this from experience) that's why most of them are cunts! 

I can't wait to get out of this house, whether is voluntarily or they get me kicked out of my beliefs. I just know, that once my feet touches the ground of outside and never comes back ""home"", it'll be the happiest day of my life. I'll be free to express myself, not being shamed of how I dress, of how I love, or what I believe in. 

Instead of caring of problems that most likely are fake, and unreachable... We should all care into the things that we can actually make an impact, like slowing the process of global warming or preventing  death penalties to innocent people! 

And now, the most recent dumb thing that I've heard she's done, is not using Chrome, because that is related to Adrenochrome... When in reality Chrome is related to Chromium... Something related with cars, speed and also color... Lmao

But yes, after realizing so many things in my life and society... It made me have a conclusion of wanting to be a psychologist.",QAnonCasualties
1888,Brother is delusional HELP!,"Sorry I’ve never posted anything before so I don’t know how this works and it’s long, but I recently came upon this guy on Twitter talking about a popular thread on here. 

My 27 year old brother believes in Q and sits on Reddit and 4chan literally all day long. When he first moved back home(to my moms after battling addiction and homelessness across the country), he would rant for hours to me about Q, elite pedo rings, and pizza gate amongst other things. (I believed him for awhile but it never really stuck) He has given me incredibly racist, anti-Semitic, anti-COVID rants and spiels and I just feel so bad for him. 

Out of four kids all raised by our mom, he’s the only fully white child and the fact that he has 3 half-black siblings clearly doesn’t phase him whatsoever because he has had no problems ranting to me about BLM and “race mixing”. He doesn’t believe that the Holocaust even happened and hates Jewish people. 


I love my brother and because I came across the thread I thought maybe someone could give me some advice as to how to help him?? I don’t know if it’s too late and I need to just cut ties with him because of his racist views and conspiracy beliefs, and let him figure things out on his own or if there’s anything I can do.. 

I’m nearly 10 years younger than him but I can’t help but seeing him as just helpless. I feel for him because he deals with severe depression and anxiety like me, and he’s had to deal with terrible drug addiction and homelessness which is why he came home. He’s never had a girlfriend and doesn’t have any friends. He still lives at home at 27 after being back for probably close to 2-3 years and all he does is smoke, go to work, and then sit on Reddit and deeeeep 4chan all day long reading conspiracies and watching disgusting graphic videos, and reading racist posts. I see no drive in him. He’s incredibly smart but he has no clue what kind of job he wants or just has no desire.

I want him to do better so badly but it breaks my heart thinking about how he probably secretly hates me and my siblings because of our skin color.(I know for a fact he hates my mom and blames her for everything wrong in his life.) 

I want to help him but I cry every time I really to start to think about how he probably hates me and how he thinks these terrible things about people and is just feeding his brain absolute garbage and the king his life away. Is there anything I can do to help him or should I cut him out from my life when I move out of my moms house?",QAnonCasualties
1889,I believe my mother is falling into the QAnon cult. How do I stop her from going all-in?,"My mother over the past few months has said some extremely concerning things over the past few months. Her opinions on many things have been swinging far-right. She’s showing signs of a cult-like mentality; us-versus-them thinking, only listening to extremely specific sources, shutting down when I try to offer a rebuttal to some of the (clearly edited) videos she’s shown me, claiming she’s done her research (but only looking at links provided by her “sources”), taking people’s word without question, claiming that some of the more ridiculous things that Q has said wasn’t actually Q, echoing word-for-word what some extremist pastors have said in regards to the election, refusing to acknowledge what the media (she believes it to be under control of the deep state or whatever), and saying that I’m uneducated on the subject when she brings up something so absurd that I can’t even begin to fathom where she found it. It doesn’t help that she doesn’t tell me her sources - she claims that they’re too dark for me (I’m 18.)

I’m not really sure what to do at this point. She doesn’t seem to comprehend my reasoning as to why some of the things she says/believes are absurd. When something conflicts with her views (such as some of Q’s more extreme statements) she claims that it’s faked. She shuts down the conversation when conflicting information is presented, or simply denies its validity. She won’t tell me why her beliefs are valid when I call into question their ability to be proven or faked. don’t even know what she believes because she won’t tell me her sources or elaborate in detail on what she knows or thinks. 

I’m really not sure how to help her at this point. I need help.",QAnonCasualties
1890,I am losing my best friend. Is it Q?,"I really don't know any more how to communicate with him and his right wing ideas are getting more and more invasive. We know each other for over 20 years. Until 2 years ago everything was fine and suddenly he became very religious. He cut the ties to all his family becase differences in religious views.
At first it seamed like all His talk is religion and Bible. But as of last six months it got more and more political and I am getting every day right wing propaganda, videos from YouTube of great reset, oppressive democrats, Bill gates and ati vaxers stuff, masks that don't work, Jesus will come and end it all - he can't wait, Trump as a good guy... He never mention Q but I am starting to doubt if that's the rabbit hole he has dived into? So many times I have bit my lip when he ranted about it, but... Truth is... That's not the same person I became best friend with. Is this Q or just a Bible? Is there a hope for him?
I noticed similar pattern with coworker who is also a pastor at some protestant church. Very similar views, similar rants.... He defended resurgence attempt with BLM rioting. So strange to hear that from pastor.
My buddy is very smart guy. He Has a family, one kid. I tried to recommend social dilemma movie so he could see that he fell into some weird echo chamber but it didn't work.
I guess I need to just ask him straight up and forget about his feelings.
Rant off.",QAnonCasualties
1891,How did this spread so much?,"So I'm fortunate enough not to have any QAnons (that I know of) in my social circles, but I'm just dumbfounded at how far this thing has spread. I say this as someone who was there at the first Q thread back when I was deep in conspiracies and even then it reeked deeply of bullshit, and yet here we are.

Fringe beliefs a few years ago are being parroted left and right, even within my own family most think the election was stolen, some are anti-vax, others think masks are bullshit, some think COVID or death numbers are being faked, some acquaintances even turned into flat earthers. These people that were vehemently anti-Trump in 2016, and mostly all-round reasonable people, did a full 180 on their views seemingly out of nowhere. Though thankfully they're not far gone enough to be full blown Q cultists to my knowledge, but it still sucks seeing people I used to respect try to get me into this, some even regularly try dragging me into pyramid schemes.

I spent several depressing and paranoid years following shit like this and it's just exhausting, it makes you lose sight of what's real and what matters. You sit there believing you are doing something significant, but you're just chasing your own tail making connections between jack shit because of some shitty half-truths you heard about from some teenager on an anonymous forum. If there is something actually bad going on these movements only serve to detract from the real issues that actually need the attention.

I'll admit I was never really anti-Trump or pro-Trump, he seemed pretty unremarkable to me up until this past year when my opinion of him soured considerably. People have idolized him into this all important, highly intelligent figure that is anti-establishment and will fix all of our institutions, even though he hasn't even come close to doing anything along those lines. It's so ridiculous that there's Q and pro-Trump groups popping up in other countries, where the US president has 0 influence over their lives. I was not enthusiastic about Biden but the sheer absurdity of the situation pushed me to vote for him.

So here I am trying to pick up the pieces. What pushed so many people to these beliefs? Lack of purpose? Boredom? Social media algorithms? The lockdown? A combination of these things and more?",QAnonCasualties
1892,Curious,"Anyway,

1893,Q Autoethnography of an incest survivor,"CW: sexual abuse/incest

I’ve been studying QAnon since 2017. I went to every primary source I could find in some weird/dark places online. I did this as an odd hobby mostly, like many of us here, bc of my own family. 

See, Trumpism, and militia/white supremacist groups , particularly the Three Percenters/Proud Boys, were appealing to the ppl I grew up around on my mother’s side. 

The same ppl who enabled and hid incest/sexual abuse of the girl children in my family - they liked Trump...*religiously*...and they liked the idea of forming a militia to help him stay in power forever. Seriously. Back in 2015-16. 

Needless to say, this made me instantly anti-Trump. I mean, I grew up in the 80’s/90’s - he was a swindler joke pig already, but...

He was also my family’s new Rush Limbaugh. The fact that Trump was so openly racist and sexist made their own ideas about the world feel right. I guess I’d like to say my family had been radicalized slowly by other right wing voices...but...in reality I think my family values were just affirmed by these voices. And it helped them feel ok. 

Because then came QAnon. And I was asked to believe that the very ppl who did not mind that I and my sister and girl cousins had been groomed and molested literally before we could speak were somehow fighting to save children from this very experience??? That the reason they hated liberals and POC and LGBT ppl and Hillary Clinton was that they were righteously anti-pedophilia??? I was instantly incredulous and curious about QAnon in equal measure. 

Q news stories sent me into memories I hate reliving and episodes of dissociation in the middle of my otherwise happy life. And so I got to work finding out everything I could about it (I’m a researcher/academic, so this is my approach to process things that make me angry and perplexed). 

Tbh it’s been an odd and traumatic few years as an intellectual who LOVES researching and studying. And as a survivor of child sexual abuse in a conservative white family. 

I’ve curiously read everything about Q. I’ve read Q. I’ve read about ppl who’ve lost their loved ones to this cult. And how, for some of us, white nationalism and misogyny had always been unspoken family values...as given as Christ and casseroles and Sunday school. 

I’ve read every secondary think piece and summary on Q. Like - every single one for a few years now. I’ve read and gained strength and comfort from your posts and replies here, everyone. Just trying to wrap my mind around it all. And trying to reckon with the hiccups in remembering my own experiences of sexual abuse as a child at the hands of the very ppl now claiming Q. 

I even called my militia uncle (not the one who molested us) and my Proud Boy cousin to maybe see if they’re ok. (They’re so not). But I knew that anyway. They’re trying to atone for something in new and vicious ways: I assume they’re feeling some kinda anger at themselves for watching, for lying. 

Because after all my living and studying and reading I think America *does* have a very insidious child abuse problem. And I think powerful ppl enable and hide it. But...

Duh, it’s within families like mine. The very families wrecked by Q. By cults. By evangelical and dissociated and toxic views of living and dying, sex and family. Gender and race. Love and trauma. 

QAnon and Trump’s role in it did not wreck my mother’s family: misogyny and white supremacy and violence did. Q and Trump and the three percenters just made the t shirts. 

Now, I’m lucky: I was raised by a father who was atheist. A US army veteran. A feminist. A man too genuine and too humble for racism and misogyny. And my mother, unlike her family, knew how to love better than she knew how to lie. 

So my boomer folks aren’t Q. And my mom hasn’t had contact with her family since her brother got out of prison (for lewd acts with minors) and her sexually/verbally/physically abusive mother died in 2016.

But growing up, incest/child abuse was a way of life in my mom’s family. So was violence. White men got to do whatever they wanted to those less powerful. White women fell in line and became abused by men/abusers of children. And everyone was openly racist. Many of the men in my family were USAF and LAPD. Military and law enforcement. 

I was terrified of and unsurprised by January 6th - from my research and my living with white Christian conservative ppl. 

I count myself as lucky because my actual parents value anti-racism, kindness, and education (neither went to college but made sure my sister and I did) and they’re alive (both at high risk and taking Covid seriously) and both VERY anti-Trump/Q/Fox News. 

But all my research and studying has brought me to thinking of my extended family a lot. The family I loved a lot growing up and from whom I learned a very twisted idea of the world - one that I needed to heal/exorcise. The family I cut off contact with in 2017. Those people for whom the Storm - the overthrowing of Biden’s inauguration - truly meant some kinda rapture that was never gonna come. People looking in ugly, desperate, confused ways for their own redemption, I guess. 

How could I not, these days, reflect on and wonder about all the people who bought guns to hunt evil pedophiles - only to find themselves staring down their own barrels and looking in long mirrors...? 


*Footnote: some of the girl cousins who were abuse victims in my family are also now passionate Q followers. The mirrors they are looking in are the hardest and the journey to their healing is one I know by heart. About their motives for taking up with this cult I was never curious...only generous. May they see that white supremacy won’t save them. Or the children they were. ♥️",QAnonCasualties
1894,I’m scared my Qfather will (inadvertently) kill my mother...,"I will try to make this as short as possible but, as many of the posts on here, there are so many layers to this so please excuse me if something doesn’t connect...

January 6th was an awful day for everyone to experience but for myself, it was especially terrible as my mother called from the hospital to let me know that she had been diagnosed with cancer. I live approximately 3 hours from my hometown where I’m currently earning my masters degree in higher education. On top of attending 9 hours worth of class every week, I’m working remotely 30+ hours week (but only getting paid for 20), and job searching in a job market that is extremely saturated. All of this to say - finding out that my mom has cancer was the straw that broke the camels back. Not because of the added stress that brings but because after the initial shock wore off, I came to realize that I am the only one in my immediate family capable, competent, and *caring* enough to get my mother through this. 

This realization comes from the fact that my father is a devout tr*mp worshipper, to the point where the house I grew up in has upsetting it enough become a shrine to the twice impeached former president. Between the two custom 8’x6’, posted into the ground signs with sayings such as “LOVE THE USA, THE FLAG, OR GET THE HELL OUT”, the 7 trump flags, the handmade “refund the police” yard sign, the multiple “got fraud?” yard signs and the blue bulbs in every outdoor light along with pointed lighting that illuminates EVERYTHING at night, I am nauseated just pulling into the driveway...

Going into how/why I think my father will end up killing my mom — I can’t say anything to him without him constantly insulting my intelligence, my partner, or my ability to do essentially anything. Example - today, I cleaned out two rooms in the house that were basically spare bedrooms turned hoarding situation. The amount of literal garbage that I was able to throw away equated to about 6-7 large garbage bins full along with the 4-5 trips that were taken to the local goodwill. I was talking to my mother about how I wanted to sort through some boxes before storing the things that we were going to keep back into the rooms - SOMEHOW he took this conversation (that he wasn’t even in the room for) as me saying that he doesn’t know how to clean (even though the state of the house prior to me starting this massive effort supports that statement. This also somehow ended with him calling me “a stupid fucking democrat who isn’t worth shit”. 

As you can imagine, actual conversations with him regarding the food that he brings into the house, washing his hands regularly, and not being around other people if he can avoid have gone very similarly if not worse. He is also still so enraged at Biden being inaugurated and believes that his bff Donnie has a plan to somehow get back into the White House this year. And to even bring up covid is just asking to be called an idiot or sheep or many of the other names he has for people who think differently than him. 

With all of this and his actions and behaviors, I am deeply afraid that my immunocompromised mother (as of tomorrow when she starts chemotherapy), is going to be exposed to so many things that are going to make her sick, make her treatment even harder in her, or even worse... just straight up kill her. I arrived to my hometown this most previous Friday and the last 55-ish hours have been so exhausting between cleaning a house that hasn’t really been taken care of since I left for college in 2015 and having emotional breakdowns every time my Qfather berates me or the thought of him exacerbating my mother’s condition comes up in to my head. 

To make this situation even more unfortunate, no one I talk to knows what to do. Even people who know my father suggest “just staying out of his way” or “ignore what he says” and the thing is, I’m perfectly capable of both those things. But what I can’t do I just sit back and watch as he plays with my mother’s health and ultimately life because he’s too prideful to admit that he needs to wear a mask around other people and wash his hands regularly. 

My partners father was diagnosed and happy to say beat stage 4 throat cancer. Unfortunately, my mothers type of cancer is one that will be with her for the rest of her days. However, my partner’s experience with his fathers cancer has been invaluable information as I do as much as possible to prepare my family for what is to come. But if I can’t even have a conversation with my father without him thinking I’m trying to “tell him what to do” what good is having this information if he isn’t going to listen, internalize and adhere to it? 

Additionally, I just can’t pick up all my things and move back home permanently. I have a partner I desperately love and am missing greatly along with three pets, and the opportunity at full time employment within the next 3-6 months. As well as where I’m located there is an excellent cancer center where more than likely my mother will also have to visit to receive treatment so it only makes sense to keep my housing situation going as to not have to worry about having to pay for hotels or lodging while my mother is sick. But this leaves me in a situation where I have to leave my mother for two weeks at a time in between her treatments in my hometown. I really do not trust my father (nor my 17 y/o younger brother with a negative sense of responsibility and behavioral issues) to be able to care for my mother in the way that she is going to desperately need here in the coming months, which could result in her condition worsening. 

I guess I’m asking for advice by posting this to this community but honestly... I feel so very hopeless about this situation. I’m not sure anything can be done other than my father waking up to the lies he has been perpetuating and taking all the time, energy, effort, and money that he sinks into worshipping a man who wouldn’t know who the fuck my father was even if he walked into this house right now, and putting it towards my mom who truly needs it. My mother has always been a selfless woman - supporting my father through multiple years of employment, cocaine and alcohol addiction, and verbal, emotional, and physical abuse. She said she always did it for us because she wanted my brother and I to have a family but I’m really wishing she would have chosen herself and gotten out when she had the chance (my parents were separated on and off for basically my 8th - 12th grade year). 

Tl;dr - my mom is about to begin chemotherapy treatment for a type of cancer that she will have for the rest of her life and my dad is incapable of thinking about anyone else but himself and I’m worried my mother will suffer, even more than she already has in their 26 year marriage, and even more than just dealing with cancer will already bring. And worst of all, I’m scared he will have zero regard for the precautions surrounding the care for an extremely  immunocompromised individual. 

Ps - I am not one to pray but I am currently taking all the prayers, chants, vibes, positive intentions and/or anything one may do to wish another well. If you wouldn’t mind adding my mother to your list, I would greatly appreciate it.",QAnonCasualties
1895,I've lost my boyfriend,"Hi everyone.  I just wanted to vent my sadness with people who might understand.  My boyfriend and I are both in our 50s and we've been together for just over 2 years. Late last year, after the American election, he started taking a interest in the outcome. He spent hours researching things online and now believes all the stuff that Qanon believes. I don't know why he developed an interest because we live in Australia and can't even vote in America.  All of the depressing crap he's read has made him depressed, fearful and mistrusting.  I've tried to remain open-minded but I refuse to research all the 'evidence' that he does. I don't want to follow him down the deep, dark hole. His moodiness has affected our relationship.  It effects our relationship in other ways,  eg. When we were required to wear masks in public, he wouldn't come out with me because it was against his principles (he won't be controlled by the govt) and he refuses to sign-in with personal details at cafes and pubs, as we're required to. He said it'd be all over on 20 Jan, when inauguration took place but no,  it's not. Now the goal posts have moved to early March. He's so far gone that I fear he'll keep coming up with excuses why the predictions didn't happen and the goal posts keep moving. 
I don't want to live my life in anger, fear and mistrust and for that reason, I'm not seeing him anymore. I gave him the choice of forgetting this bs or losing me. He said he's a true believer and can't give it up.  I feel very sorry for him and I feel guilty for not being able to tolerate his beliefs. I don't know what benefit he gets from it. He says it's ""biblical"". Have I done the right thing by calling it off?",QAnonCasualties
1896,Brother in law is total wackjob; took my dad and sister with him,"I met my sister’s now-husband about three years ago at a lunch. When we first met, he was an extremely cool guy — a recently unemployed advertising executive who was burning time in LA. He drove a nice car, lived in a nice apartment, extremely well-educated, charming and a convincing communicator. I introduced him to my sister because, well shit, he was awesome.

From the start, his ideas were a little weird, but it made for interesting conversation. We would smoke some weed and chat for hours. He would present some conservative views and I would counter with some liberal views; the type of civil discourse you would aim for in a modern clavier society. He almost always won the conversation but it never changed my mind because losing an argument doesn’t mean you’re necessarily wrong. 

As time went on, he married my sister (who was a classical California liberal), becoming more religious and more avowedly pro-Trump. Every conversation was about how Trump was making America great again, Hunter Biden’s laptop, Hillary’s emails... nothing truly substantive from a policy perspective. Just delusions of an American decline and Trump’s ability to restore our greatness. When did America stop being great? Fucked if I’d know.

Anyways, he and my sister showed up to my house on the 4th of July without masks and refusing to wear them. My family had already made a strict MASKS REQUIRED rule in the house for anybody who came in. Long story short, they started a fight in my house because they refused to wear masks and tried turning it around on me to get me arrested. It didn’t work, and now we have a new tile in the house: when they try to come over, call the cops on them. Needless to say, I don’t speak with them anymore.

Around that time, my dad was on the way out of the house after a divorce. He started spending more time with my sister and her husband, and even got my piece of shit brother in law a Porsche. My dad and me stopped talking for a while, but i decided to to breakfast with him and my girlfriend a few months ago to acquaint the two. Big mistake — the conversation was generally pleasant until he he brought up how masks didn’t work and the pandemic was fake. The rest of the breakfast was awkward, and we went it separate ways. I haven’t spoken to him since.

I was surprised to hear that type of stuff from my dad’s mouth. And then it hit me: my brother in law nibbled at the glia in my dads brain like a mouse chews on the wires in a home — the same way he did with my sister — and took him off the ledge. A hurricane of QAnon, election fraud conspiracies, fascists wet dreams, COVID conspiracies and general global delusion (and the occasional Soros association) made me lose my sister, once-best friend and most recently, my father.

I’m living in a different country to my family- they’re in Australia. 
In the last year, my aunt who is such a sweet funny person, has become a full on q believer. 
I’m so heartbroken. She’s not taking care of herself, eating properly and spending a lot of time alone and online. She will stop people on the street to rant at them. 
Her kids- my cousins have had to cut off contact with her because she just rambles all the time about awful q theories and drinking babies blood etc 
My mum also had to stop talking to her because she just couldn’t take it anymore and they’re very close. 
I think about it a lot and I can’t do anything being so far away. 
I even called my mum and dad yesterday and talked to them for a couple of hours about what Q was and why they have to be careful. If they have any questions about weird news articles they’d found online, or any weird theories, I hoped they’d call me for a chat about it.  ( a lot of our parents aren’t the most internet savvy people )
They both assured me they’re not into q and they too are worried about my aunt but at a loss about what to do. 
I just feel sick. I’m not sleeping well and I’m so anxious. There’s a lot going on this year without extra stress but I almost feel like I need to cut back internet time as well because now it’s affecting me. 
I’m out of work at the moment and it’s been a bit of a rough last 6 months for anxiety and depression and being so far away from my family. I know there’s not much I can do for my aunt, and I feel like I’ve done my best here to protect my Mum and Dad, as well as confident for now that they’re ok.
Any support for how you can de stress a bit and find a bit of peace of mind would be greatly appreciated.

1900,"My mom died of alcoholism but blamed our estrangement on ""political differences""","TL; DR: After supporting my mom through rehab, I had to kick her out of my house due to her abusive behavior. She claimed it was political differences.

I'm 38 and my Sister is 36. My mom (59) died last summer after 40+ years of very hard drinking. The official cause of death was an upper GI bleed. I'm in a very small town in rural Kansas. Even though she died alone, it was blatantly obvious to the coroner (also the last doctor that saw her 4 days before her death). No autopsy was performed, at my and Sister's request, as it was not needed, according to her doctor. After looking through her apartment on the day she died, it was obvious to both of us that she was very sick for some time. 


A couple of months before she died, I finally had the courage to kick her out of my house. She had been staying with me and my husband for about 4 months, after getting kicked out of her friend's house and ending nearly all other relationships, mostly due to her drinking and abusive behavior. She was destitute and I felt sorry for her. 


She had been growing increasingly conservative for the past few years, with multiple political arguments started for no reason. She was also vocally racist towards.Blacks and Hispanics. She referred to my Sister's husband as ""that fucking Mexican"" and used the n-word when Obama's name was even mentioned. She casually referred to my Sister's newborn, half White and half Hispanic, as ""the cutest little beamer"". She had told me more than once how she loves her three grandchildren, but wished they were ""just White.""


She was horrible towards my husband, starting stupid fights while he was watching TV. At one point while he was watching a YouTube video on our TV about gardening, she muttered ""Liberal gardners"" and then goes on a rant about how dumb it is not to know how to grow tomatoes. 


The final straw broke when, after sending her to rehab once during her stay, she was drunk by 4PM and started ranting about how my husband needed to ""get off his fat fucking ass and do something around the house"". I gave her three days to get her shit out of my house. I didn't care where she went. 


After she died, my Sister and I found her journal from her last stint in rehab during the month after she left my house and the month before she died. I was hoping that maybe she was working through some deep childhood trauma and was trying to forgive herself for so many wrongs. Instead, I found a questionnaire where she was asked why she was in rehab. She answered that it was because her Son (me) and her had ""political differences"". She also had an entire section of a journal dedicated to Q and all the bullshit that comes with that. 


I write this because I firmly believe that many of those susceptible to Q are deeply traumatized and often have a physical dependency, possibly leading to substance abuse. If you have someone in your life that is totally in on Q and you want to help, see if there is something you can do to break down an underlying trauma.",QAnonCasualties
1901,Update about crazy qanon MIL,"So she bought an American flag to hang on their empty flag pole that has been empty for over the past 2 years. It's hung upside down because that means the country is in distress when only she and other q people are in distress.

She argued for 10 minutes who the commander in chief is. She's saying Trump controls the military so Biden can't control them currently and we're running with two governments right now (Trump's military and Bidens presidency). My boyfriend and his dad argued that Biden is the commander in chief. His dad even raised his voice a little, most of the time he doesn't care and never comments, but he was arguing on this one. She refused to accept Biden as the commander in chief.

She showed me a picture of an oval office with film equipment in it. The whole thing that Bidens not in the White House and is being recorded somewhere else. Anyways the room was entirely white (looked quick didn't  really care) and I know for sure Biden's rug in the oval office is blue. Also, Trump had to show off his signature every time he signed something, but we're well aware here that facts don't matter.

Covid didn't exist when Trump was president but now it's Biden the Dems are just trying to kill everybody (not sure if it's the virus or vaccine doing the killing, but we're killing people). They're rushing the country open and going to kill us all.

This is a very republican family, just their mom is like this and my bf, his brother, and dad will argue with her about the crap she says.

Now my bf does believe Biden committed a crime or something and kind of in response to his mom's crazy he said ‘why would they wait to get Biden in trouble now he's president?’ (because the FBI was going to arrest him at the inauguration) so I told him that either Bidens did nothing wrong, or, to appeal to his republicanism, he has done something but other people know and are covering it up for him.

I do want to mention since the elections, he was a little mad Trump lost, but in the end, he says he doesn't care, there's not a reason his mom should care, he says there's nothing he can do now and the government is going to do whatever they want (because their corrupt which I'm sure is true).

The entire family seemed weird at times because they're very republican but now his mom is qanon crazy, the rest of the family seems normal.

Note: my brother said some qanon people believe Biden and Trump are working this conspiracy together trying to expose the corrupt government so be on the lookout for people accepting Biden but for the wrong reasons I guess.

They seem to take everything they say as the truth and “they do so much research” and “they’re so connected” they think they can’t be wrong.

That was intriguing to me how is my mom into this stuff. Well I'll give some back round. My mom has always been into apocalypticism and Catholicism. She had the basement stocked and ready to go to prepare for Y2K. Shes always been that type of person but it wasn't until recently I heard her talking about the cabal and the deep state. When she told me about project looking glass I laughed. I said the military has more than one mind ya know. I doubt the entire military asked trump to run for president.

Shes catholic very religious and I'm unsure who she talks to about this stuff if they're roping her in. Religion is cool having spirituality is cool and she has every right to have that but it's how do I have a conversation that can separate Q and church. Like she's following a false prophet or something. Youd think all the prophecies Q had conjured that havent come true would be enough to turn someone away but shes still on. I am someone who doesnt buy into conspiracy theories because I cant prove it I've also seen friends lose thier minds over it and fall into deep depression. I think we all collectively have questions about the world and how it works and with those questions opens a market of answers and where to find the ""truth"". I just think it's easier looking at conspiracies bullshit first and how it maybe interesting second like how you can read Tolkien or marvel and know it's just a convincing story. Anyway its been tough I fear for the future of those still convinced Q is the all knowing answer to what's going on in a confusing world but I would love for my mom to drop it go back to church back to praying reach out to old friends who arent caught up with Qanon put this stuff behind her. The only thing I think that could be challenging is her life long belief in the second coming and the end of times that would be hard for her to give up since that's been such a  identity of hers for much longer and how she got into Q.

1913,The politics of unhappiness? The surprising link between conspiracy theories and mental health,"From  ""pizzagate"" to 9/11, conspiracy theories are everywhere—and research  shows they could be linked to things like stress or isolation

by [James McMahon](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/author/james-mcmahon) / August 9, 2018 / [Leave a comment](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/the-politics-of-unhappiness-the-surprising-link-between-conspiracy-theories-and-mental-health#respond)

If  you’ve suffered with a mental illness for long enough, chances are that  at some point, you’ll begin to recognise patterns to your health.

When I am well, I am enthusiastic about the world. I like the world. I like myself.

When  I’m not, I want to know everything there is to know about Chemtrails.  The suspicious death of Kurt Cobain. I fear my extensive knowledge of  Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 would *not* be a hit at parties, even if I felt well enough to attend them.

Over  twenty-plus years of zigzagging between relative happiness and  obsessively Googling “why did the third tower collapse?,” I’ve come to  wonder whether there’s a link between the two states of mind.

A  recent study suggests that may be so. Early last year, the Journal of  Experimental Social Psychology published a report that suggests such  interests, as well as superstition, may well be caused by ostracization.

A  study was conducted in which subjects were asked to write about a  falling out with a friend, as well as their search for meaning within  their life. They were also asked to rate how excluded they felt.

Then,  the participants were asked to rate their belief in two conspiracies:  that drug companies withhold cures and that subliminal messages were  used by the government to control its population.

Subjects  were also asked if they believed in the pseudo-scientific theory that  paranormal activity was rife in the western area of the north Atlantic  Ocean known as the Bermuda Triangle.

The  results showed that the more lonely people felt, the more they believed  in both the conspiracies and in the idea of the supernatural.

\*\*\*

In  recent years it’s been suggested that stress plays its part in leading  people to fringe beliefs, too. Professor Viren Swami, from Anglia Ruskin  University, performed studies in 2016 that took 400 participants  between 20 and 78 and asked whether they believed the 1969 moon landings  had been faked.

Professor Swami  also polled subjects as to whether they believed that Martin Luther  King, Jr. had been assassinated by the American government. He then  assessed subjects’ stress levels—most significantly, stressful  situations that might have occurred within their lives in the last six  months.

The results showed that the more stressed a person was, the more likely they were to believe in conspiracy.

“Stressful  situations increase the tendency to think less analytically,” says  Professor Swami. “An individual experiencing a stressful life event may  begin to engage in a particular way of thinking, such as seeing patterns  that don’t exist.”

“In the  aftermath of distressing events,” he continued, “it is possible that  some individuals may seek out conspiracist explanations that reinstall a  sense of order or control.”

\*\*\*

Last  year, the Collins dictionary declared ‘Fake News’ their word of the  year, thanks to its “ubiquitous presence” within the preceding twelve  months. We unquestionably live in times of mass distrust. And here’s  where things get dangerous.

If  you’re unlucky enough to be aware of the now comprehensively debunked  conspiracy theory known as ‘Pizzagate’, you will know that during the  2016 United States presidential election cycle, the personal email of  Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta, was hacked. The  contents were then released to the public via WikiLeaks.

Turns out that John really likes pizza. He orders a lot of it.

Yet  on the forums of 4chan, the internet’s notorious meeting point for  conspiracy theory, it was decided that these pizza orders were actually  code for not only human-trafficking but a child-sex ring run by members  of the Democratic Party.

A  Washington DC pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong was implicated. A man from  North Carolina went there and fired three rounds into the shop with a  semi-automatic rifle.

Incredibly, nobody was hurt.

\*\*\*

It’s  fair to say that scientific studies establishing connectivity between  mental health and belief in conspiracy is a developing field. More  plentiful are a variety of surveys which seek to establish links between  various social and psychological factors and a belief in conspiracy.

One  of the most significant of these, reported by Psychology Today in April  2017, involved mining data from one of the largest surveys of mental [health](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/basics/health) ever carried out: the US National Comorbidity Survey-Replication conducted between 2001 and 2003.

Subjects  were asked the consider the statement; “I’m convinced there’s a  conspiracy behind many things in the world.” More than a quarter of  subjects believed that to be true.

Digging  into the data, there were a number of commonalities. Those who agreed  with that statement tended to be male, unmarried, with above-average  levels of social disadvantages, such as having relatively low income and  education levels. They were more likely to be from an ethnic minority.  They were more likely to carry a weapon. And they tended to report lower  levels of physical and psychological wellbeing. Many had considered  suicide.

Think of the mass murders  committed by ‘Incels’ just this year—young, heterosexual men who  through a combination of isolation and misanthropy believe their lack of  sexual activity is in fact a conspiracy.

“\[More\]  psychological models of conspiracy theories need testing” concludes  Psychology Today. ”Indeed, we don’t know enough about conspiracy  theories full stop. But given the current socio-political climate has  this kind of research ever been more necessary?”

Conspiracy  theories aren’t a creation of modern times. Within the medieval era,  the anti-semitic belief that Jews were poisoning water supplies in order  to kill Christians was rife. The term “conspiracy theory” itself  appears as early as 1909, in an article published in [*The American Historical Review*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Historical_Review).

There’s  some dispute as to whether the term always held negative connotations.  Some, like Bob Blaskiewicz, Professor of Critical Thinking at Stockton  University, believe so. Others, like the lexicographer John Ayto,  suggest that the phrase only really became a slur in the 1960’s.

This  view is backed up by Lance deHaven-Smith, professor of public  administration and policy at Florida State University, who believes the  term was adopted and popularized by the CIA to discredit [John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories).

Either way, the word is now so tainted by association that few who *do*  believe in fringe theories would ever describe themselves thus.  Instead, they prefer the term “Truth Seeker.” (Case in point: you can’t  get this twitter handle now unless you want to add *a lot* of digits to the end.)

We  know conspiracy theorists. They’re silly. They wear tinfoil hats in  movies to protect them against alien death rays. But “truth seekers”?  That’s a hell of a rebrand.",QAnonCasualties
1914,Forgiving those that followed Q?,"Hello,

  I am writing to see how I could possibly get my father to comprehend he has totally lost it into this conspiracy world. I noticed years ago he was posting shit on a fake Craigslist account in LA, even though we live 2,000 miles from there, talking about conspiracies regarding Obama's birth certificate. I should have said something then, but I did not. 

  Prior to Thanksgiving of 2019, we would debate things to which he always provided some shady .ee.pr.eidn.dnfinf website and I brought the actual paperwork that contained no biases. During Thanksgiving, I just lost my shit listening to him ramble on and on and told him he was a dumb fuck. Well, that did not end well. This man hates being wrong so much when I was a kid I remember hearing air come from a small hole in the tire, which I pointed out to him. He swore the hole was elsewhere and once I put my finger over it to show him the noise stops he lost his shit and ripped my shirt off trying to fight me like a man. He's big, but I've been just as big since middle-school and just brushed it off. 

  Anyways, he swore me off ""for good"" and ""never wants to see my worthless ass again"". I had hoped he would get past this Q shit after Trump was given the boot, but he seems to be going deeper. I could probably spark up a conversation with him and maybe get things going again. But is it worth it? 

  My issue is he knows growing up I dealt with their swinging, meth, crack, verbal, sexual (not by them, but mom's crack dealer), and physical abuse. He also knows that I do not follow any (wo)man as I find that all people are corruptable and flawed in some way. I've never been a political person, but have formed opinions on who would do a better job during the last couple of cycles (Obama, Trump, and Bernie). Yet, he still believes some stranger online over his own son that has stuck by him throughout all the shit? WTF, I do not understand how he lost sight of how much I crave truth and facts. I do not like being lied to and he knows that. 

  My mom died years ago after battling brain cancer for 13 years and he denies she ever had it... I literally have the pics and witnessed her getting Morphine, Oxy, and Chemo. Not to mention the 3 massive brain operations that left her bald and with dozens of stapled in an X pattern. I finally forgave my mom for everything after not seeing her for the last 5 years of her life. Should I try to do the same with my dad? Our family has a history of dying at 62 and, well, he is 62 this year. It is coming up on 14 months or so of not speaking in any way, shape, or form. I have been going to college and seeing a counselor to fix my broken life and I'm not sure if I should add him back into it or not. I have 2 daughters that would love to see their grandpa again and I'm unsure if it is too selfish for me to keep them away. I care more about what's best for them than me or him.

Sorry for the long post. I've never actually ""vented"" like this online and it felt good.",QAnonCasualties
1915,Qgrandparents Make My Life Hell,"I've been staying with my grandparents for about 2 years. I moved in with them because, at the time, I was highly suicidal and needed some time away from my mom &amp; siblings (long story short, my father passed away when I was 7 and fighting got worse over the years as well as mental illnesses). I got my much-needed break, and healed enough where my chronic depression was in remission and I was able to actually enjoy life.

Enter QAnon.

My grandfather started listening to people like Alex Jones and Dan Bongino (if that's how you spell his name). He had already been a far-right conservative for many years, and believed in quite a few conspiracies, especially when it came to Obama.

As time went on, he would stop participating in activities he used to look forward to, and consume more and more QAnon content. He stopped meeting people, stopped going to breakfast with my grandma, etc. He'd only go to church on Wednesday and Sunday (family is Christian but I'm atheist).

Then he started lecturing me and my grandmother, and trying to spread his conspiracies. At first I was open to it because at the time I still held some conservative views, but as time went on and my political leanings shifted, I got tired of the lectures fairly quickly. 

Every night I would be bombarded with hateful statements about celebrities and liberal politicians, and I got so tired of it I finally snapped and told him that I would prefer to not discuss these matters with him anymore.

All was fine for a few months, but then the election happened. By now I am fully liberal and have come to realize how harmful trump is, so I watch the news and election with some level of fear and optimism. 

Because I turned 18 this year I voted for Biden. I didn't tell my grandparents, but eventually they figured out my political leanings after overhearing conversations with friends, and they threaten to kick me out for my political views. They spew pure hate and anger at me and I end up leaving, not to come back for 2 weeks.

I only stay there at night to sleep, but the rest of the day I spend at my mom's. I refuse to speak with them about politics, and avoid talking to them if I can help it. If politics are brought up, it is by them, and it always ends in shouting matches, guilt tripping, hateful statements, etc.

1916,"""Am *I* the crazy one?"" Losing a Brother to Death &amp; Losing Family to Trump/Q","The last five years have been very hard, but the last year has been especially difficult. Part of this story I have to kind of blank out family members because they're on Social Media.

I am a W/F... I grew up the first 13 years of my life in a small city, and was exposed to people of all races and religions. I am SO thankful, looking back now, that this was the case. Right around my 13th birthday, my family moved to a rural town you couldn't find on a map at the time. It definitely felt strange to me to be in such a white town.

When I was around the age of 6/7, my aunt found out that my boyfriend was black (we dated from kindergarten thru 5th grade) and gave me my first introduction to racism by calling me a ""N-lover."" 

That sparked my curiosity, so of course I ran to my mom to ask what it meant. It didn't really make an impact on me then other than that kind of waking me up to people being \*different\*, but about 8 years ago I started to realize just how vile and hateful she really was... and how that one question was such a deep look into her soul.

Fast forward to 2015, and I can see the nightmare that is Trump building. I can see how it's affecting my family... I have several in my own household, plus my aunt, who have fallen pray to this aggressive, hateful and paranoid philosophy. I can see it spreading thru to my grandfather, even.

These people who - aside from my aunt - I had never heard a singly solitary racist comment from were suddenly slinging them brazenly. They will throw out racist comments and linger with silence expecting me to laugh or agree, but it'll go right over my head until I realize what they're doing. I get so disgusted with it that now I've just started playing even stupider until they either give up or feel stupid themselves.

Then, February of 2020... my little brother was very ill and suffered over 40 days in the hospital/hospice before he died at home at the age of 23.  


Way back then... the DAY AFTER HE DIED... way back then... BEFORE VOTER FRAUD WAS EVEN BEING TALKED ABOUT... these people were in my house talking about ""If Trump loses the election, it was rigged and we're going to have to arm ourselves and get ready for a civil war."" Yes, February 2020.  


And that's why January 6th was so horrific for me. I've seen this coming for years, and I'm sure many of you feel the same way - and we were all gaslit or told that \*we\* were the crazy ones. It's all in our heads. We're blowing it out of proportion.  


When they said that, I was so appalled... I left and went off somewhere else. How the hell could you say this after your own grandchild, son, nephew, brother, (anything) has just died? How is this what you are talking about right now? As if the timing alone isn't appalling, what they were saying was just so surreal to me. These are people clearly not rooted in reality.  


I have to hear things from my own family such as:

""You kids are brainwashed by public school..."" how am I brainwashed, but your kids who agree with you and went thru the same school system as me arent?""

""Just wait, if Biden is inaugurated... we're going to lose all of our personal property and be just like China. We're going to have to wear mandatory masks and it'll be a specific kind frim China.""

""Welfare is for white people."" ""This is our land.""

""Guess who will still be your friend no matter who you voted for? Not me, because I'm not friends with communists.""  


My aunt is the only one whose fallen down the Q rabbit hole, but I'm very worried about the others who are clearly all prone to these lies and propaganda.  


When the pandemic started I would ask myself if I was crazy or if this was real life from time to time, in my own head... but now I can tell that it's really taking a toll on me because I'm verbally asking those questions all day every day.  


I feel hopeless. I feel those feelings of grief and mourning that I felt when my brother died... because not only did I lose him, I cant even run to the only people who are supposed to be able to comfort me because they're batshit crazy. I feel isolated and alone. The pandemic is killing mental health... and to make matters worse, my two siblings were overseas in South Korea from December 2019 until December 2020, so that made the grieving process hard as well. They are stateside now, but still far.  


I don't know where to even begin with how to appeal to these individuals in my own family, and pull them back from this insanity. It just sucks because so many people feel isolated right now all because their family chose to elevate a politician above their loved one.  


I still have to grapple with the fact that my own \_\_\_\_ registered to vote just to spite me. Like, don't get me wrong, I'm all for everyone voting, but this was intentional. I finally put my foot down and said ""I am no longer going to debate with people who don't even vote..."" and so they went on to register as soon as they could just to spite me and trying to mentally exhaust me. 55 years on this earth and you had to do it just to spite your own \_\_\_\_.

So my brother let it slip.  I don't know what he said.  Neither does he.  But he let it slip that we know Mom joined QAnon.  Except he didn't say QAnon because he couldn't remember the name.  He said *cult*.

I arrive home earlier than my family.  Suddenly as I'm settling down I get a text saying ""Get out of there now. I let it slip. Mom's pissed."" So I take all my things and leave, making it look like I was never there.

Now I'm sitting in a church parking lot figuring out what to do.  I just got back from a friend's house (she needed help at home) and she said I can come back, but she lives like an hour away.  I asked my brother how mad she is, and he said ""Somewhere between 'shouting at you' and 'kicking you out'.""

Good to know.

""And she said that next time she won't bother hiding the gun.""

1921,Q view from across the water,"  

Over the past few weeks I have looked into all this Q stuff, only really because it became so prominent in the media. All I ever heard about it before was #Pizzagate and then I passed it off as a small fringe of nutters. Bear in mind that I am not in America so don’t see all the day in day out news. Anyway, when I started to look into it, all I can say is that I was shocked and saddened, even more saddened reading some of the stories as to how Q has destroyed so many families. Q is a game, a game which unfortunately has been used to steer many to one political agenda.  It has been used by the powers that be in politics to further divide people for their own gain. But it has gone too far, unfortunately I don’t think that some care, they will continue to post Q drops to keep many in the loop or rather their loop and they will lap it up behind the scenes as they watch the carnage.  

Too many people’s lives have been destroyed by this and I really do feel sorry for them and their families, they truly believed, they were so far down the rabbit hole. They deserve all the help and sympathy one can offer to bring them back.  They believed a lie though no real fault of their own, they were preyed upon. 

Now as I have said, I have only been looking into this for the past few weeks but one person that I find as being fundamental is a guy called Lin Wood. Now don’t get me wrong, I do believe that Trump has played a significant role in this, as has the likes of Cruz, Cawley, Beobert, Geetz, Green, Guiliani, the junior Trumps &amp; their partners, and many many more but Lin Wood is like bait as people buy into everything he says, after all he is such a clever guy, a distinguished guy, earning mega bucks, big law practice, why would he risk his career or his money on something that is not true. He is highly educated, of course he knows what he is talking about?  That is what confused me after I listened to a conference call with a University who was considering taking his name off a court room, a conference call which he had signed in under a false name and only revealing himself after the Dean had explained to the facility all the issues she had regarding him and his behaviour. But he was calm and articulated. Was all weird to me, how could this calm, articulated man be the man that was saying all these things regarding the election, the Q conspiracies, referencing the firing squad for VP Pence. It all did not compute.   

I googled Lin Wood and came upon a site who was hosting him as a guest. The site is called Rumble and they have been doing podcasts, called Fireside with Lin Wood for a number of weeks. I really only listened to the last one, episode 9. Briefly listened to a few before but not in any depth. In Episode 9, which is only a few days old, Wood is, in my opinion, in defence mode, deflecting, damage limitation. Now, I have to say, even after listening to this, I am not sure if he is deluded or very clever. He has, at the end of the day, set up fund raising which was promoted on that podcast. He suckers people in on the basis that he has found God.  Virtually all through the podcast the host, Clay Clark, responds to Wood’s comments as “exactly” or “you are right”. 

The host also asks people to text at a certain number and he will send you absolute proof that what they are discussing is 100% correct. They will send you links to all sorts including a 270 document from Sydney Powell which proves it all. They also talk about all the components  in the Dominion voting machines as being from China but if you actually read the 270 document it actually states that only one in five parts come from China based companies. There are so many holes but they claim all they are saying is the truth.  What is so disturbing about this host is that he consistently praises his guests with confirmation that what they are saying is correct even thought he really has not got a clue and has never actually looked into their claims. If there was ever a definition of Fake News, Rumble is up there at the top. 

When question Lin Wood on the fact that nothing happened on 20th of January, no arrests, no Trump getting back in power, Wood responded with “The Bible teaches us without question that if you follow Jesus Christ you shall be persecuted, not maybe, you shall be persecuted”. I don’t think the Bible teaches us this. So basically because what they thought was going to happen, as they have been told so many times that it would, actually did not happen, this is all part of the plan and you should be persecuted more and you should take the pain as being a loyal servant to Jesus. Would you give me a break, there is moving the goal posts and there is being totally led up the garden path following magical breadcrumbs.

He felt it would be resolved earlier but says that God does not work on our time. Basically, he is saying that all should wait, this is God’s plan, there will be arrests eventually, it is all part of God’s plan, his timing. 

We will find that Justice &amp; Truth prevails, believes there will be arrests, timing is not his forte,  it might take a little bit longer,  if Trumps takes over now it will be viewed that he is taking over by the BLM and Antifa funded by George Soros, he is buying time trying to avoid a civil war

When asked who is in charge, Biden? The Military? Trump? He responds God but in the real world it is an illegitimate Government &amp; that Trump has never broken any laws &amp; did not do anything against the Constitution but it is his belief that the Military are in charge right now. He backs that up by saying people should look at what happened, why was Biden sworn in almost 17 minutes early, why was Lady Gaga being introduced on one channel and on another finishing her song. Why does another man say that he saw the inauguration 10 hours before it was supposed to be starting? Suggests that it was a fake inauguration. He then goes on about a Colour Revolution, they will be coming after you next, they will be coming after you freedom of speech, then they will be taking your guns, then they will be taking you due process, that is how they do it in other countries.  Then reverts back to the Lord, people should keep believing, don’t let them do that to you, don’t stoop to their levels of treason.

The host then brings in a fledgling to “the Christian Team” came over when he heard about Dominion links with Soros (which there are none, already fact checked) and that one of the heads in Dominion was an “outspoken Antifa member” and that Sequoia Softmatics was founded by Communists in Venezuela, his head exploded.  Now if you look into the history of Sequoia you will find that Dominion bough some of their assets in 2010 but the company a few years later and Softmatics bough what was left in 2005 but after the election scandal in Venezuela, which Softmatics blamed on rigging by the Venezuela government, they put them up for sale in 2007and Domionion bought them. All separate transaction, no link in any company, in fact all companies are competitors.  Both Softmatics and Dominion have categorically stated that they are not connected and as we know Dominion is suing multiple people regarding their defamatory claims. Eric Coomer from Doninion is suing no less that 14 people including Trump for their allegations that he said that he would get Biden elected and that he is part of Antifa. Check out the case, awful lot of straw clutching going on in the Trump field on this one, absolutely despicable how they think they can just use someone for their own political gain. Oltmann has not got a leg to stand on. 

He then goes on to talk about the Federal Reserve, saying that it stemmed from Rothchild bank, established in 1913. Now here you have to consider when someone throws in something that is fact, do you believe all what is said. This is a prime example where you do not. He is factually incorrect in 90% of what he is saying but are you clever enough to research it to debunk what he is saying or even questions him. The premise of his argument is that Donald Trump will come back and to save the country is to bankrupt it, says that would be the smartest thing that Donald Trump would have ever done, and as the Federal Reserve is a private company, i.e. America Inc, it must therefore default on its loans, which he proclaims are China. Once they do this the US can basically start from scratch. He is also suggesting the China are interfering in the election to ensure that the US do not default on their debt. At this point I realised that he is either bonkers or he has skin in the game.  It is off the wall stuff but he is relying on those who are listening to him to believe every word he spouts as they are not educated in that field to question him. Now don’t get me wrong, I am not criticising anyone on their knowledge or their education, but if I have a problem with my car I take it to my mechanic not my dentist.

He claimed to have gotten covid and refused to get tested. We are trying to see if we can organize some kind of video call to try and get through to him but are too nervous to go see him in person. Because he may have gotten covid we really are not sure he might have just had a cold and claimed it was covid. Unfortunately he is under the impression that getting tested is what kills you despite knowing that several of us have gotten tested and someone we know has gotten the vaccine.

MONTREAL -- A Quebec man obsessed with COVID-19 conspiracy theories was found in a police raid this month allegedly amid a cache of weapons, including pipe bombs and a semi-automatic rifle.

Martin Clermont, a man in his 40s living in a small town about an hour north of Montreal, faces several charges laid over the course of two days.

But his family says they believe the danger he posed was mostly to himself. They were the ones who called for help, asking the police to intervene.

Clermont already struggled with mental illness, his brother told CTV News, and his family has watched with great concern as he spiralled downward in the last year, fuelled by online conspiracy videos.

“We didn't want him to go to jail but we wanted him to be safe and to have help,” said his brother, René Clermont. Both men live in Louiseville, just south of Trois-Rivieres.

Despite his brother’s stockpiling of weapons, René Clermont said the family believed the imminent danger was to his brother’s children. Clermont was interested in survivalism and he had talked about taking his son into the woods.

The idea of that, while he was in the midst of a serious mental-health breakdown, was troubling.

“We were afraid for him and his children, because he wanted to go into the woods with one of his children,” René Clermont said.

“We love him and we intervened out of love for him and his children. We don’t think he's dangerous, and he never made threats to us.”

Clermont changed a lot over the course of the last year, and specifically since the pandemic began, said his brother.

He was mostly captivated by French-language YouTube videos and social media channels that focused on outlandish conspiracy theories about the virus.

“Since the pandemic he had been watching a lot of things on the internet,” said his brother.

The videos he watched were often about how “the pandemic is about controlling people” or how there are “\[micro\]chips inside the vaccine,” he said.

Clermont’s Facebook page shows many posts along those lines, including a few about so-called “chem trails” and one claiming that syringes have “trackers.”

His brother says Clermont had previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and it was clear his health was suffering.

“He did drugs and was hardly sleeping anymore,” he told CTV.

Clermont faces two rounds of charges laid on Jan. 7 and Jan. 8. He was charged first with possession of explosives, then with possession of a prohibited weapon.

Christian LeBlanc, a spokesperson for the Quebec Crown prosecutors’ office, said the prohibited weapon in question was a CZ-858 tactical rifle, the same kind of semi-automatic that was reportedly used in the Quebec mosque shooting of 2017.

Clermont is also charged with storing firearms, possession of an Annex 1 substance and possession of cannabis, as well as making threats to family members.

He first appeared in court Jan. 9, returned for a bail hearing on Jan. 19 and was released on conditions that the Crown office didn’t disclose to CTV, though various Quebec media reported he’s ordered not to possess weapons, not to take drugs other than some prescribed medication, and not to harass certain people.

His family also told media that he believed a civil war was coming and was preparing for it, including his plan to take his son into the woods to protect him, saying the boy was the “chosen one.”

According to several reports, the explosives were a series of homemade pipe bombs. The Journal de Montreal reported that nearby neighbours were evacuated because of the threat of explosives.

Quebec provincial police didn't respond to a request for comment.

The day after his bail hearing, Clermont wrote angrily on Facebook, writing, in French, that media was sensationalizing the situation and that “nobody was put in danger.""

“To everyone who has something to say, come and say it to my face,"" he wrote.

He’s due back in court on March 19. None of the allegations have been tested in court.",QAnonCasualties
1934,Hung up on my mom because of Qanon (and cousin having a religious psychosis bc of Q),"I’m 22 F and growing up my parents were far from perfect; my first breakup was super hard because his family was the healthy family I always wanted, but I always loved my parents and couldn’t live without them. I’m super close to my mom as well, which is why this hurts so much, and I know there’s probably worse stories, but still.

I never see my mom because of covid and she lives too far away from me, the only way I can talk to her is by phone. Today I called her to talk about what’s up, until she brought up Qanon like usual. 

Everytime I called her in the past she always ended up bringing up Qanon and we would argue, but today was the last straw; being told unironically that the capitol was stormed by antifa, and that Fox News is the only reliable news source, and then being called brainwashed because I don’t believe this bullsh*t... 

I thought that seeing how nothing happened at the inauguration maybe she would’ve stepped down a little.. but seeing how it wasn’t the case just triggered me so much and without thinking I hung up, I was so mad. 

I’m scared of losing my mom, I already have abandonment issues... I don’t know what to do. I have a cousin who is having a religious psychosis over this and he thinks we’re all possessed by demons... his girlfriend told him to either get help or she will leave with their daughter and he called her Satan... I don’t want my mom to end up like this, if she does it’s over I’ve lost my mom. 

I just want to feel less alone in this, and maybe some advice.. I feel powerless 😞",QAnonCasualties

1936,I lost the love of my life to conspiracy,"I really don't know how to start this. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. My main reveals a lot more about my identity and because of the embarrassing and depressing nature of this - I really don't want people I know personally finding out about this. I found this subreddit's existence through a MAGA cope account on twitter. I was looking through to see if anyone else had been through the same thing I had been through, and kind of searching for some kind of comfort in other people's stories of losing parents, siblings, friends and lovers to Q anon and related conspiracies. 

I'll start with how it began. Me and my now ex partner met around exactly a year ago, and right from the get go it was love at first sight. They were everything I was looking for in a person. Rather intelligent, funny, charming, got my humor and we shared a lot of the same interests. He was attractive too, and we just got along like a house on fire. I always got excited to speak to or hang out with him, and little by little, as we got to know eachother, we fell in love. I woke up everyday, feeling amazing, and he was always on the forefront of my mind. I have had a really rough past. Filled with a lot of mental health calamities to say the least, and a lot of trauma that came from terrible experiences in my teenage years and he supported me through it. 

I noticed things started to go south a couple of months ago however. Over quarantine, I started to get more into leftism and really threw myself into activism work and a lot of things I never thought I would have the courage to get involved in. And it rocked my world. He however, fell down the opposite path. He started telling me how he was feeling depressed, and how he felt like his mental health was faltering. I, of course, started worrying about this, and tried to be as supportive as possible. 

He then went through a series of rather unfortunate events, but I assured him we would get through it and I would be there to help him. He started pushing me away, and refuting my help - and that's when arguments started to arise and he started to clash with me. I told him I was going to get the vaccine as soon as possible and he had a total meltdown, and started spewing antivaxx rhetoric at me, trying to convince me that he was right. He gas-lit me, put words in my mouth and tried to argue that he knew best, and I knew nothing, even though I provided him with sources and an overwhelming amount of logic. This freaked me out, because I had never seen him act out like that. 

Then when the election happened, he started arguing with me about the validity of it. Which again was odd. Before all of this, he was an avid progressive and supported people like Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang. He had another massive argument with me, where in which he totally blew up over the topic of Black Lives Matter and claimed it was all some government conspiracy, and how no black people actually supported it, and it was all white people who just wanted some kind of new world order. And then went on to talk about how Donald Trump only got a bad rep because of media and how he was seen as some kind of king and reality icon before his presidency. 

I remembered going to bed upset over it, and wondered how much worse this could get. He was fully invested in the Hunter Biden's laptop conspiracy and by this point, I was trying by best to ghost him and slowly push him away, but I kept taking him back, because, I loved him...deeply and there were times where he still seemed relatively sane, and I thought maybe it was just a difference in opinion. But I realized how much I was beginning to dread talking to him about anything. When the capitol riots came around, I knew I was going to deal with an onslaught of bullshit from him, so I tried to steer clear of the topic, but he started going off, all over social media about how it was a coordinated ANTIFA attack, and tried to justify it in every way. He went on a spree of shitting on BLM from a height, arguing with me using nazi rhetoric and other extreme alt right talking points and I found myself crying over it, completely decimated by this. 

It evolved into him being also critical of 5g and that worries me considering how the man who bombed Nashville was a 5G conspiracist. He also fully believes in some crazy elite pedo ring stories, and I'm pretty sure he now believes in the deep state shit. And I can't even bring myself to look at him anymore. We fell apart so quickly, that we went from being in love, to no longer talking. I don't even text him anymore but I worry about his health constantly, and sometimes I feel myself wanting to intervene. The hardest part is knowing he's so far gone, and he's no longer the person I once loved. He's no longer that witty, interesting person that donated to progressive campaigns and good causes, and it hurts knowing he was such an easy target due to circumstance. I think he was a victim of not only Qanon but a victim of his own mental instability and series of crappy events in his life. And it made him an easy target. Watching him fall farther and farther away from reality has been so difficult. 

I'm sorry this is so long. I just haven't got the chance to get this off my chest - and I feel guilty because I feel like I should have stepped in earlier or maybe my advice and knowledge wasn't good enough and didn't sink into his head.

1937,Having our first baby soon and just cut off Q parents,"Hello, 

I found great support and validation through this group and in need of some support at the moment. 

My husband and I have just mailed a letter to my parents informing them that we cannot be in their lives while they continue to support and engage in these values. Our first baby comes in a couple months and this was very difficult. I flip flop between if I have done the right thing but I can’t risk this being around my daughter. My parents have always been so close to me and I love them. I have tried to have a relationship with them while not getting involved with their beliefs but they have caused pain to my siblings and I can’t be complacent anymore. They have only gotten worse since the inauguration and continue to wait for the next big day. 
It hurts me to think of them reading this letter but I felt as though I had no choice...

1938,I see the light. Ex been messaging me this BS Q nonesense,"I have to admit I was once a Trump supporter, I am no longer.  I never subscribed to the Q nonsense. The events of the past few weeks have made me realize alot of things. Trump mislead, lied and lead people down a dangerous path. The events of Jan 6, made me realize how harmful and dangerous misinfo and conspiracies can be. Trump embraced conspiracies. He vilified the media which in turn caused people to search out alternative sources. This in turn caused Q to thrive and further the BS that the election was stolen and that Trump needs to be President to stop this ""Global Cabal"" It is dangerous how Trump didn't denounce this and only furthered it. I don't think the election was stolen or even think Trump won by a landslide. I identify myself as Moderate Conservative and it is dangerous for the Conservative movement to subscribe to Q. 

I am glad I broke up with this woman i was with years ago. As we know one of the tenants of Qanon is that it is highly Anti Sematic. It really is. It subscribes to this notion of the conspiracies that Jews control the world. I could not believe some of the stuff she was saying. It is that kind of thing that fuels white supremacy, fear and violence. That is what makes Q so dangerous is that it seeds violence and hatred for people who are completely innocent. I told her that Q and other conspiracies thrive on fear and hysteria with no real solutions. I cannot watch the videos she sends me. I won't share it. I said this is crap and I cannot further this mess. It does not solve anything.",QAnonCasualties

This is an article on medium.com by Reed Berkowitz. It’s a bit long but it’s incredibly interesting. 

This is a TLDR from a daily newsletter called Cup of Coffee written by Craig Calcaterra:

QAnon: an inverted game

Yesterday one of you forwarded me this fascinating article in which a game designer — one who designs games to be played in reality as opposed to computers, such as live action role-playing games (LARPs), alternate reality games (ARGs) escape rooms and things like that — analyzed the QAnon group. It seems like an odd combination, but as the author notes at the beginning, it makes a lot of sense:

When I saw QAnon, I knew exactly what it was and what it was doing. I had seen it before. I had almost built it before. It was gaming’s evil twin. A game that plays people . . .

The author notes that there are some differences — he describes QAnon as “the reflection of a game in a mirror” — but notes how QAnon “uses many of the same gaming mechanisms and rewards. It has a game-like feel to it that is evident to anyone who has ever played an ARG, online role-play (RP) or LARP before.”

Chief among them: the concept of apophenia, which is defined as “the tendency to perceive a connection or meaningful pattern between unrelated or random things (such as objects or ideas).” In games this tendency causes players to think that innocuous things are actually clues or plot points when they’re really not. This is a problem for game designers because it gets the players off the track the designers want them to be on.

With a conspiracy theory like QAnon, however, apophenia is intrinsic to the idea’s very existence. Those who first propagated the QAnon conspiracy did so specifically in such a way that almost anything could be seen as evidence bolstering the theory. That, in turn, has led to adherents adding their own mythology to it all, by “finding evidence” or “clues” backing their beliefs basically anywhere and everywhere. Whenever a “clue” is found, it reenergizes the “player” and makes them more invested in the “game.” Which makes it damn nigh impossible to get them to stop playing.",QAnonCasualties

1943,Their heartbreakingly grotesque happiness,"TBH it disturbs me that at some level, they're CHOOSING [their ugly, distorted view ](https://imgur.com/a/3txEx29) of the world and the people in it. 

I've never been able to tolerate the Calvinist vision of mankind as inherently fallen, or the Evangelical joy that one is saved (even if one's family and friends aren't).

In some ways the Q cult is worse, because this ""modern"" belief that MOST world leaders are pedophiles (or at least okay with pedophilia), and are harvesting blood from tortured children, and that soon all these people will be rounded up and executed before everyone's eyes, seems more direct and tangible somehow.

But even if I DID believe that, I would be filled with sorrow about it. I can't imagine gleefully waiting to watch even ""bad"" people be condemned and hung, shot or whatever. It's one thing to imagine the Trump family behind bars for life. It's another thing to feel excited to see Tom Hanks, Pope Francis and AOC literally hanging from the gallows. (Hell, I wouldn't want to see Trump hanging from the gallows!) 

It's just so dark and ugly and depressing.",QAnonCasualties
1944,Any other non-believer feel completely mentally fcked from the debunking?,"Not sure if this is the right forum, but here goes.. and apologies if this turns out to be quite long. 

I'd like to know, does anyone else feel completely mentally goofed from all of this Qanon shite? A bit of context about me, I came across Q randomly. I think one day last spring I checked out a random trending topic on Twitter, clicked on a link and it took me to this 'Steemit (?)' page or something like that. Well, the page was full of completely random garbage which I now know to be Q, all the deep state, Hollywood, blood libel bollocks. Now, at the time I'm mortified but quite amused with what I think to be this random woman's inane thoughts. Well, I go to debunking and my internet searches take me deeper and deeper. I've never believed it, but before I knew what 'Q' was and that it was a whole concentrated eco-system of millions of people, I tried to understand it. As many of you will know, there's no way to understand, and as I didn't know what it was, it wasn't like I could search Q and read about it in a mainstream publication as I can now. 

I've been through some absolute cess-pools, which I'm not afraid to say scared the shit out of me. I've watched the weirdest YouTube videos, come across the most horrid material from everyone from Alex Jones to Icke, basically, I went through the gauntlet. It's strange as I don't consider myself a 'victim', as I never believed it, what struck fear in me is the people who pushed Q. The strange Italian man on Youtube, all the antisemitic shit, demonic imagery, occultism, it just got too much for my brain. 

I went to private therapy here in the UK as I couldn't get the imagery and horrible stuff out of my brain, and I was diagnosed with OCD (Purely-Obsessional) with intense rumination and research being my main compulsion. I got a bit better but the strangest thing happened in the Autumn.. I live in Birmingham, UK, which is hardly Washington DC, but I saw #Savethechildren graffitied outside a small train station near my house (I didn't realise how big it was here until found this sub a few days ago). And weirder still, in an even smaller town north of Birmingham, I was in a post office in October, sending a parcel when this gentleman asks the cashier if she has any Venezuelan currency to exchange. Innocent enough, but my ears pricked up when he started informing her that whilst Biden might win the upcoming US election, he's a fake and the economy will crash until Trump is back in March this year. At this point I'm thinking Jesus Christ I can never get way from this shit and it's seeping into real life. I felt like finding him after and telling him it's all BS, but thought the better of it in case he doubled down and started showing me some weird stuff on his phone or something lol. Luckily, my therapist taught me a lot of anxiety control techniques so I left it, it still felt weird though. 

I've started using social media again and I can see there's so many anti-Q researchers and debunkers which is good, but I just wonder how they're able to  go through all data, horrific images, insane garbled prophecies, and sleep at night? I've always had a healthy disdain for conspiracy theories, but I felt like a firefighter constantly having to reassure my brain that no, this isn't real. 

Has anyone else been like this? I know me not believing it may sound unbelievable, as I've often asked myself if I don't believe it and was not taken in, why did it illicit such fear in me? The only answer I can think of is that I didn't tell anyone else, nor try to find people like those in this subreddit, equally confused. I spent 9 months thinking I'm going mad, scared to reach out to others in case I ended up I the wrong place and other rabbit holes. 

I'm not sure what the overall point of this post is and if it'll even be approved, it sounds dramatic but I genuinely feel that I've got some form of PTSD from this. I get horrid flashbacks, random names of the main Q pushers come back to me, and I just feel a general sense of dread.  

A warning: please do not get sucked down any rabbit holes yourself in trying to understand how people can believe this shit, though I know it's unlikely as you're already here and this community seems great.",QAnonCasualties
1945,I lost my stepmom to QAnon,"This is my first time posting. Discovering this group has really made me feel like I'm not alone. I'm a little nervous and I apologize for the length but here is my story.

I met my stepmom when I was six. I instantly loved her. We became close right away and she was my favorite person in the world. Although I had a big family of eight siblings, I felt like I never really fit in. All my siblings were half and much older than me. At my mom’s house things were tough I didn’t get along with stepdad. My brothers moved away and my mom had just had a baby, I felt pushed aside like my mom was creating this new family that I wasn’t a part of. My stepmom was there for me she would listen to me and make me feel loved. I felt like everyone else saw me as a nuisance, but she genuinely enjoyed spending time with me.

As I got older, I started to care about politics more. Whenever I would discuss my views with her, I could tell she leaned more conservative, but she still had an open mind. She would agree with policies on both sides. This changed over the last four years. I began to see her spending a ton of time on Facebook. Her beliefs became more radical and she started promoting QAnon conspiracies. If I would disagree with her she would get super aggressive and argumentative which was not like her. 

She had always been so kind and supportive and suddenly she was angry and hateful. In college, I majored in Biology. When I got my first internship at an environmental research facility, she made a point to tell me that climate change was not real and just a tool used by the government to control people. I felt heartbroken this was my field of study something important to me and she was dismissing it like it was nothing. I started seeing that she would post stuff about Jeffrey Epstein frequently. She was obsessed with the Clintons and their corruption. She was so angry with the government and politicians it's all she would talk about. Since the pandemic it's gotten worse she believes COVID-19 is a hoax. She joined Parler and her posts there were even more radical. I saw she followed all these Q people. She would post about how the Christians are under attack and are being censored but she does not go to church and never has. She stopped watching Fox news and switched to News Max. She's been pretty quiet since the capitol riot and the inauguration. However, I don't think she's come back to reality. My dad tells me in private that he thinks she's becoming more irrational but he's too afraid to talk to her about it. 

I cannot even have a conversation with her anymore without it turning into an argument. I try to avoid the conversation but she brings it up. I try to reason with her, but I cannot. Everything with her is a conspiracy. She just seems so angry and full of hate. It is sad because she has done so much for me. I'm still grateful for the relationship we used to have. As a kid, I loved her so much and now I cannot stand to be around her.",QAnonCasualties
1946,Does anyone have those people in their lives who are into qanon theories but don't know about qanon itself?,"Sorry for a bit of a long post, especially because other people might be experiencing something similar;

My father is not the brightest crayon in the box, and I mean this in the nicest way. I don't know if he's ever had a critical thought in his life (outside of carpentry, he's a great wood worker/artist). He's also diagnosed with pretty severe ADHD, and after drugs took over his life, he got worse. 

My dad used to be a liberal democrat, for context, he took me and my brother to punk shows and ""fuck the police"" was something we learned early on. Then my dad went to jail for drugs and came out sober and a Christian. It started a few years back, he was getting radicalized slowly I think by his then girlfriend, now wife, who is a conservative Christian. 

Basically I stopped talking to him for a while because he pissed me off, and then, as an adult, I got in contact with him again through Facebook after I learned he was sober and going to a new church, I thought, maybe this would be good for him. But I was disappointed at what I found. He spews nothing but Trumpisms and hatred. He's a Mexican man but I see him post white supremacy-lite things, that BLM is a terrorist organization as well as Antifa. Also constant Islamophobia as well as posts saying Christians are oppressed. Also, a weird one, suddenly he doesn't believe in climate change when he used too. It was when he posted transphobic things that I finally blocked him because I am a gay woman, married to a woman, and a lot of my friends are transgender. It was just so hurtful I couldn't take it, it was the straw that broke the camels back.

I finally talked to him and asked him point blank if he was into qanon and he says ""I don't even know what that is. I'm just telling the truth."" He posts things about democrats being pedophiles, and the covid virus being a lie (for context, he thinks its real but he thinks the flu is more deadly, despite the evidence. He thinks the government is using it to control us). He believes all the qonspiracies. The secret kabal, the 10 days of darkness coming, Trump being sent from God, you know all that shit. Apparently before the inauguration, he told my brother to stock up on supplies, like water and food. I finally looked back at his facebook, just to see how he was doing and he was just writing hateful things about Biden, and lies about the election fraud (saying facebook is trying to censor him). The thing that really scares me is that he mentioned on one of his posts that he goes to church on Saturday and Sunday and doesn't wear a mask. We are in California where it is mandated and in a county were the numbers are going up exponentially. We are at 90-100% capacity with hospital beds. This man just two years ago had a heart attack. I'm worried he's going to have to get it in a serious way to become a true believer, and I don't want that to happen. He's still my dad you know?

Anyway, sorry for that long post, but I needed to rant a bit. Also I was wondering if anyone else has people who have all the beliefs of qanon but without being into Q itself. Did that all just come from facebook? What's the deal?",QAnonCasualties
1947,My MIL is clearly Qanon and I don't know how much more patience I have.,"My wife and I are very far-left, and usually don't talk to our parents about our views.

1950,Venting. I’ve lost most of my respect.,"Me and my husband have been together for years. We don’t agree on everything but we agree on the important things. 

To me, this is important. This is a matter of recognizing reality and not. Honestly, this is bringing up a lot of things that were probably unhealthy before he started believing in Qanon conspiracies. So I guess that’s one positive. I just hope and pray we can find it within us to solve these issues. 

Our whole relationship he has asked me to conform to him in one way or another. Whether it’s where we live, what we do with our time, who we spend our time with. And I’ve followed him. Because I trust him. Because I admire him. He doesn’t ask these things explicitly. I can just feel the anxiety he has whenever I want to live outside of the box he has created for himself. And growing up in the home I grew up in, I craved stability. 

So To do this to me now feels like such a betrayal. Because to me I’ve squashed so much of who I feel I am to compromise with him. And while I continue to work hard to move towards our family’s future- he decides he would like to take a little mental break from reality. I wish I could do that. I wish I could for once, forget what I’ve learned as an adult with responsibilities and people depending on me- and be who I crave to be. He gets to do that now by believing in madness.

One thing that really messed me up is her  belief that global warming doesn’t exist and I care about global warming and the animals and plants that will die from it I know this is not the right sub Reddit but I don’t know where else to put it I’m just very emotional and depressed and need to let it out.,QAnonCasualties
1954,AP Research Student In Need Of Help!,"Hello! My name is Linda and I am currently enrolled in an AP Research course that revolves around finding gaps in topics of our choice and figuring out a way to bring attention to those gaps and potentially solve the issues with our own research. This year, I have decided to revolve my own research on Conspiracy theories specifically QAnon.

For my research, I am trying to figure out why people believe in the theory and what types of ideals have influenced them to engage with it.

Here are some of the questions I would like to ask anyone who has ever been influenced by the theory or an ex-believer:

* When and where was the first time you heard about QAnon?
* What types of documents or posts have you encountered about QAnon that have influenced you or someone you know to believe that the theory is true?
* What made you an ex-believer of the theory?
* Lastly, has someone ever influenced you, or have you influenced anyone into believing the theory? If so, what types of ideals did you/they bring up to make them believe?

I would really appreciate it if your answers were specific as possible. Feel free to either post your answers here or email them to me at [salazarlinda743@yahoo.com](mailto:salazarlinda743@yahoo.com)

I look forward to hearing from you! thanks (:",QAnonCasualties
1955,I’m hoping Q is labeled as a national threat and domestic terrorist by the FBI or a dangerous cult and members of Congress involved are arrested and charged with domestic terrorism. The FBI probably is tracking these criminals for subsequent future arrest,Conspiracy theorists and cults pose a national threat to all Americans,QAnonCasualties
1956,I live in canada and thought my fellows would be safe,"Qanon was always something ""going on down south"". For the last 5 years, I was worried about North America as a whole. Trump was always looking for conflicts. I thought that it could all be isolated in the US.

When Qanon arrived, things began to change around me. There’s now random people doing streams and talking about Q. It’s like this huge mystery in here since we don’t really know about  the chans. The people around me have their feet firmly on the ground, but Qanon made me realize that everything is possible if you give wicked people a dream. 

I don’t know what to do. I just see this community grow on our side of the border and thought that when Trump left it would be over, but it doesn’t do anything. People keep going on about all kinds of crazy alliances that makes no sense. We have people protesting the virus. Ignorance is scary with how contagious it is. 

I wish we could be left alone for once and have peace. Sure, Trudeau isn’t really competent, but he wouldn’t play parts in some big conspiracies,  except maybe the occasional corruption. I don’t understand why there are sympathizers in my homeland. It all feel so unreal. Now, I’m worried about my peers. What if there is a new Q that is Canadian and leeching of the original to gain a cult following? Now that people know how gullible honest and distressed people are, how many are going to take advantage of them?",QAnonCasualties
1957,What is this whole March 4th/5th thing that the Q followers are talking about now?,I'm confused. I know it's all gibberish but why are they saying March 4/5th is the real day that the inauguration is happening and Trump is still President (Funny considering he moved out). I have very normal friends repeating this crap now and I want to know where this is coming from so I can set them straight.,QAnonCasualties
1958,Dealing with an abusive evangelical christian QAnon mom," Sorry in advance for the long post, I just really needed to get everything out to try to make sense of it all. I recently left my home (20) because me trying to stop her red-pilling to my two sisters, dad, and me, ended up with me being called satanic, and accused of trying to kill my her. It was a good choice not just for my mental health, for her’s as well, not having to see my face and become full of hatred. 

What makes trying to rationalize with my mother about her QAnon beliefs extra difficult, is she doesn’t think she believes in QAnon and uses her religion as her reasoning instead. Yet all the corruption theories she believes is from QAnon. She was one of the early believers of QAnon theories, but the intensity of her beliefs and times she spends just on Facebook skyrocketed since COVID. To make matters even more confusing, we’re Canadian, never lived in the US or have any family there. 

My mom thinks she’s a prophet appointed by god (I’m refraining from using the Christian capital “God” because this god she is listening to I really want to believe is different from the Christian God, and I do not want to disrespect Christian members in this subreddit). She is actually a Reverend, studied theology, was a pastor at several churches in our community up until a couple years ago. Now, she thinks she is chosen to be one of the many shown by god all the corruption in the world and tasked to share it with others. 

She zoom calls her “friends” (aka other people who also believe they are prophets chosen by god, or are followers of her who listen to her every word, like Jesus’ disciples) about 2-3 times a week. Together they “ascend to the courts in Heaven and listen to all the things god is doing on earth, and all the sins of people he sees and is in the process of punishing” (Her own words). Afterwards they talk shit about their family members who are “blind” or “indoctrinated by MSM (which she also calls mainly satanic manipulation)”. 

While her and her group are in these “courts”, she says god gives them visions of everything happening in the deep state and what will happen in the future. Once they descend, to confirm their vision by “researching” - scrolling through Facebook hours on end every day hunched over their screens. She sees all these ridiculous theories that apparently match her visions, only strengthening her confirmation belief for this whole deep state theory. She believes all of it - cabal of Democratic pedophiles, Bill gates created COVID and the vaccine, election was stolen, Antifa caused the violence at the capital riots, and Trump is the saviour, but mixed in with some other ""christian beliefs"" like Obama was the antichrist. She thinks Trump is a representative Christian and was appointed by god to do god’s work. But the racist ones were worse - agreeing with Trump that Mexicans are evil, BLM was a movement to make American communist with black people trying to take power and she instead saying “all lives matter” (my sister’s boyfriend is black, I could just see the hurt and frustration in her eyes hearing all of our mom’s words). All of these theories she doesn’t think originated from her being in a social media rabbit hole, but from god first in her visions then only see that they QAnon are “coincidentally” doing the same thing. 

All of these beliefs she tries to push down our family’s throat, has put all of our relationships with her to the maximum strain. It’s not just the red-pilling, but it’s the abusive screaming and accusations she does when we say we don’t agree with her beliefs. In all honestly, both of my sisters and I already had poor relationship with her before Trump appeared in the picture, but she is taking what we did have and just ripping it apart into pieces. Growing up she has been a very emotionally abusive, delusional, narcissistic parent, and being caught up with the evangelical christian movement made it all worse. If we didn’t “pray in tongue” on her demand, she would think that we were possessed by a devil and try to exorcise them out of us - by screaming at our faces. 

This past week with Biden’s inauguration has done nothing to shake her beliefs. She’s been saying right now is the “Days of Elijah”, she is standing for the ""Truth"" like who Elijah in the Bible contested with “prophets of Baal” who were apparently blasphemies. Apparently those to go through fighting for the ""Truth"", will be rewarded greatly. I don’t know if any of this will ever end, I don’t how to balance trying to deal with her emotional needs with my life and goals. But in my past attempts to reconcile any relationship with her - she puts her beliefs before her own daughters. The only reason I haven't quite lost my sanity is I have the most awesomest Dad ever who has supported my sisters and I throughout our lives, and sisters where we support each other. Dad if you're reading this, I'm doing great here at my friend's and being very productive to finish my last semester!",QAnonCasualties
1959,Q as an addiction,"I just listened to Douglas Rushkoff (media theorist, author, genius) talk about QAnon in his Team Human podcast. He likens it more to an addiction than a cult or mental illness. People are in Q for the dopamine hit they get from solving puzzles and making connections (even when there are none, as in apophenia). But after the dopamine dies down they  are left with paranoia until they get another hit. They are more like addicts than cult members. And I think I can understand this quite a bit. I, too, am trying to make the connections that will solve the puzzle. Why are Q people the way they are, who is behind this, how much does it matter, what will happen next? These questions are, in a sense, unknowable, but in order to soothe my anxiety, I try to know it all anyway. But Q is not a logic we can deconstruct, it's an addiction. 

Rushkoff's solution is to replace the unsatisfying dopamine hits with ocytocin, the love drug that comes from genuine human connection. He tells people to get together in meatspace, solve problems, do mutual aid work. We do not have to include the people who ""see engagement itself as compromise, for whom inclusion feels like annihilation... It's okay to seek a compromised, unsatisfying middle ground... We don't have an easy solution for democracy or human civilization. It's a struggle, it happens way too slowly, and sensemaking will always leave us feeling incomplete. It's just too complex... Our brains are being trained to seek certain and totalizing answers, to be intolerant of the incomplete and unresolved state in which we actually live. The only choice, I feel, in such an environment, is to turn to your actual neighbors and address real problems, engage in mutual aid, do favors for people, take our eyes off the screens and feeds and back onto the other people in our world. The screens only show us what's wrong and turn any potential activism into some version of fan fiction through which we attempt to interact, en masse, with the mostly obsolete top-down systems of our society. No wonder we are so frustrated. But the real world is way more accessible... there's real service we can do today to relieve pressure, make us less angry and paranoid, demonstrate alternatives to addiction, and replace dopamine with ocytocin...""

1961,My uncle is Qanon hardcore and I kind of was as well,"Hey all,


I'll try to keep this short. I'm very much a Conservative and supporter Trump while he was in office, with a right leaning world view on Guns, personal freedom, etc. That said I am willing to listen to differing opinions and am not opposed to other ideas. That said my Uncle who raised me from age 12 to now I'm 29 has become a big time Qanon follower since about 2018 and I was in a small way more so because I see what has happened in this country with the media, the system, and the way things are so the idea of Q was appealing and wanted some sort of hope that something was being done and I believed it to a small extent but had my doubts and never really got into it that deep so getting out wasn't hard. 

Fast forward  to now every single Q prediction has been complete BS and I have tried explaining this to my uncle but he's ""done his research"" and so I'm wrong. The latest prediction is March 9th after January 20th or whatever didnt come through, I explained to my uncle that they cant keep making predictions and not following through and expect to still believe what they say, and they can't keep moving the goal posts as that's irrational.

He is/was the most rational, level headed man I've ever known and this Q garbage is putting a strain on our relationship as we've been very close all these years, and I hate it because I love him dearly and just want him to come back to reality, things like we're going to lose power, we're under martial law, USA inc., Trump is still president, the inauguration was fake etc absolutely make me furious because I know he truly believes it and I can ""do my research"" by using my fucking eyes and he still cant see.

I basically had to tell him I dont want to hear anything more about any of this Q shit as it's just as bad as conspiracies on the ""left"" in my eyes. I also said that if this March 9th thing doesnt go through that he needs to concede that it was bullshit and to let it go. I don't know if that's going to make a difference but I'm doing my best.


Anyway just needed to vent a bit and hope this doesnt violate any rules as this is my first post. I'm glad this sub exists and I hope that others in similar situations to mine will find peace.",QAnonCasualties
1962,I recently found out I had Q Brother and need some help.,"My F27 brother M24 believes in the conspiracy theory that there is a secret pedophilia group controlled by Hollywood and the CIA. He believes there is no integrity left in journalism and  thinks that everything we watch, listen or hear is all done with a hidden agenda. Now i understand his criticism on certain outlets and their political agenda however I am very fearful that with this way of thinking that he will change drastically and not for the good. I have tried to show him some legitimate sources that do not have a political stance and even asked about news outlets in other countries yet he is convinced that the big 5 corporations not only determine all that we see, hear or watch but he believes we are being brainwashed by the media. I want to help him so bad, I just want to be able to show him that there is still integrity left in journalism and that there is facts that are given to us and not just a made up story. Do i have a chance at being able to show him this, or is this a lost cause and a waste of time? 

TL;DR my brother basically believes the QAnon conspiracy theory and I need help with showing him that it is a conspiracy theory and not the truth.",QAnonCasualties

1964,"My husband isn't Q, but was a Trump lover","We've been on and off fighting and arguing about Trump and right/left politics since 2016, him being a Republican, and me being a Democrat at the time. Over the course of our relationship, I learned not to trust either side's biased media without doing research on both. And while my values are still Democratic, I felt a lot of left wing media was very pandering, and I decided to call myself an Independent instead, because I'm not very ""progressive"". I'm what being a Democrat USED to mean, with my large focuses on healthcare and women's rights to abortion. 

Anyway, my husband was a staunch Trump supporter, and whenever I tried to bring up ""omg, guess what Trump did/said this time"" he wild refute it. WHO, Paris Climate Agreement, things like that are all horrible to him. Even when Trump deferred SS tax and made it mandatory for military (which my husband is) he knew it was stupid, because it'll hurt his paychecks for the next four months. But that didn't a sway him. I could barely get him to admit that Trump was at least a buffoon when he spoke.

But after Jan 6th, he came home from work and said ""yeah, I can kinda actually believe that Trump incited the Capitol storming"" and it was such a breath of fresh air. To hear him, without me mentioning it, or a debate to convince him, to just come home and admit Trump did something horrible. No ""whataboutism"", no ""but Biden did...."", no ""yeah, but democrats are saying...."". 

We've been debating Trump since the first campaign. ""Hillary had a seizure, she's not well"" and ""Benghazi"" and ""the emails!"" And then during 2020 ""Biden is too old, he's unwell, he's only getting in so he can die and have Harris as president"". I think he's just happy that ""orange man bad"", as he would say, isn't plastered all over left wing news anymore. He listens to both to try to get a rounded approach, but always sides with the right anyway.

He's still a Republican, but at least he saw the light, for once, without a debate and with Biden in as president, I feel so much lighter in my heart.

1965,"I have a Qmom back in China. I love her, but there's nothing I can do.","I’m from China. Unfortunately, yes, we have people following QAnon in China. A lot.

When I was about 9, my parents divorced and I’ve been living with my mom since. She’s my one and only, we had a very close relationship and talked about almost everything. Movies, books, boyfriends. She’s a strong person, brought me to a large city on her own just to get me into a better middle school. It was tough, but happy. She’s very into philosophy, always getting those books and introducing them to me. I loved them as well. All was perfect, life was sweet.

About ten years ago, when I was in high school, my mom discovered this website called “Awakening”. Lizard people, 2012, Ascension, Spiritual Awakening, etc.. Those videos are from YouTube, and since we couldn’t access YouTube in China, staff of the website would download those videos, translate and re-upload them onto the website. She showed them to me, and I believed. They were interesting, like the novels I read and loved, and life seemed more exciting. But I was never obsessed - it was just fun to read and watch. Yet, yes, I was one of them. 

My college wasn’t far from home, so I lived with my mom until i graduated. She took me to some spiritual workshops, some “healing courses”, and met with some local believers. She looked that happy, meeting people “of our kind”, and gradually starting to say things like “I don’t think I can stay with people other than the ones who know the ‘truth’. “ She looked so happy and excited.

Then, I came to the US for my master’s degree. That’s where things changed.

I can’t remember exactly when I didn't care a bit about those stuffs anymore. It just faded from my life. Maybe because I became too busy studying, or that I loved my new career, or that I found the love of my life. Those things just disappeared from my life.

And it felt good.

When I video chat with my mom, we would still talk about those things sometimes. She’s still into it, and i thought it was good since she’s missing me so badly. It keeps her busy, and back then she was mostly into spiritual stuff like meditation and emotion-healing. She liked to talk to frustrated people to help them regain hope in life, and some of them really thanked her. It was all good, nothing too excessive.

Until she learnt about QAnon.

I mean, it’s okay to have some healthy beliefs - if you have a normal life and work, but believe in some “New Age” stuffs like “all is love and light” “trust yourself and be yourself” etc., it’s okay. So are other religions, as long as they do no harm to your life or your loved ones. But not conspiracy, no. It doesn’t help with anything. Meditation calms you down, but conspiracies don’t. Conspiracy is just some dark Gossips made up to make you feel noble. It devours your heart with scaring stories, fill you with anger, and then destroys your faith in humanity. In the end, either your friends/relatives leave you, or you consider them one of the ""demons"".

China is famous for blocking information from its people, but yet I'm telling you, there's a huge group of people following QAnon in China. CRAZILY.

From what I know, there are several Q's WeChat group chats  (like Facebook group chat) that delivers screenshots of latest Q's messages and his other famous followers' on twitter. Usually those group chats wouldn't last long because once WeChat administrators discovers it, it'll get banned. Unfortunately, the followers are so, so united. They've friended each other, and would soon form a new chat. They'll always get the latest news, and spreading it to their families' and friends' chats. 

From that day on, any chat that my mom's in, has been filled with things relating to Q's conspiracy.

I had made efforts. I said mom don't read those stories they aren't real, they're just scary. She said no they're all true. I said COVID is real and it is the reason I can't travel back now, she said no it's just something like a flue. I said mom don't look at those pictures of men dining with children's blood you'll have nightmares and those are just photoshopped. She said, no, we had to force ourselves to look at this, 'cause it's real, and the children need our help by spreading the message.

Did you hear her? She said ""WE"". The great Q's followers, they are a group, collective, a community who's saving the world by spreading bloody photoshopped pictures.

I've seen her getting sad, angry, or even mad when I tried to express my suspicion. I gave up, long ago. She's just too deep down the hole, there's no way for me to pull her up. I wasn't by her side when there were possibilities of getting her out of this. It's just too late. I gave up. I'd rather see her happily telling me those ""news"" she learnt, thinking that I was also interested. I know this is so wrong, but what can I do. I'm the one leaving her alone, can't be the one who also takes away her belief and hope.

She was once a very, very kind and shy person, but now very easy to be angered and aggressive. Anyone saying anything against her would make her mad instantly. She's been reading those aggressive words all-day everyday (like ""WE ARE FOOLED!"" ""F*ck THOSE LIARS!""), and I can't suppose anyone to stay in a normal mental situation in such a negative information environment.

Well, F*ck you, Q. I know my mom is the one who wanted to believe in you, and you didn't force her to, and I couldn't stop her. But F*CK YOU.

I can't remember since when I'm afraid to call her. The moment she picks up the phone, everything is about Q. How I wish she could ask me how my life had been, did my neighbor's cat come to my bedroom again, or did I eat junk food that week. Or sometimes she did, in the last five or three minutes, but I was too tired to say anything having listened to those stuff for over an hour. I started to use another phone or tablet when we call, reading some news or even playing a stupid game, because I just don't care about Q. At all. But what can I do? She needs to tell me this, I'm her closest daughter, the closest person on earth. She has no one to talk to about these stuff in real life, I'm her only one. ONLY ONE. My heart is filled with sorrow when thinking of this, but what can I do. When the call ends, I hang up with a deep, deep sigh, feeling glad that the next call would be a week later. And this thought would even hurt me more.

One day, my uncle (her brother) contacted me. He said, your mom keeps saying things about Qanon, deep states and all those nonsense, please keep an eye on her or I’m pretty worried about what she would become.

So that day I video chated with my mom, I told her again to stay away from those dark conspiracy, but focus more on the spiritual things. That’s all I could think of, because I know she wouldn’t be interested in any other things. If she’s living happily studying those meditation courses, learning how to live a calm life and help others, it’s good. There aren’t many practical uses, but does little harm.

Hours later, I received her message. She said: “Why did you ask me not to spread those messages? What do you mean by ‘spend more time on other spiritual things’? I’ve been studying spirituals all day, and just share some messages I think that’s useful and important. That’s all what my life is now.”

“That’s all what my life is.” This sentence hurt me so, so deeply. I love her, so very much. She was once that smart, that strong, that beautiful, that kind. Why would this sentence come out of my mom’s mouth, the most beloved person of my life? Do this all happened because I left her alone? Would things be a little better had I never leave her side? But no I just can’t go back to that life, not ever again.


I told her, mom I just wanted you to be happy. You do whatever you like. I’d always be on your side.

She answered, alright, I love you too. 

And the next day, I woke up with our chat full of “Q’s messages”. I replied to her some emojis, just like everyday I did before.",QAnonCasualties
1966,Trying Hard Not to Tell Q-Friend the Obvious: Q is the Chief Purveyor of Child-Porn Fantasies,"If there is a plus side to the pandemic, it has been that I have been given the luxury of watching a high school friend’s mind implode from afar—all thanks to Q. 

It is deeply annoying to read all of the rubbish he publishes online. While I have hoped that he would eventually snap out of it after the inauguration, he is doubling down, especially on the pedophilic cabal stuff.

What has come to anger me so much about this strand of the Q delusion is not only that Q members invent pedophilia where it does not exist, but they do NOTHING to stop actually-occurring child exploitation. 

This fact has led me to an uncomfortable conclusion: Q members actually ENJOY fantasizing about the most lurid forms of child abuse. They take great relish in elaborating the most twisted sexual fantasies, displacing them onto innocent bystanders, under the guise of militant piety. There is no sexual fantasy that is too lurid for them. They are perverts.

Though I have serious reservations about sharing these feelings with my friend, I am also having a hard time holding myself back from doing so. On the other hand, as someone who has nephews and nieces visit during the summer, I also have begun to feel that it is not safe to allow them around the kind of person whose entirely life is wrapped up in pedophilic fantasies. 

Is this last point too harsh? And when, if ever, would it be useful to point out that my friend is spending too much time engaging in sexually sadist fantasies?",QAnonCasualties
1967,We cut my parents off from their grandkids and they said we are being intolerant of their differing beliefs.,"We have tried to explain that it has crossed a line from differing beliefs to harmful beliefs. They said they would never cut off family like this with total alienation. That hopefully one day with the help of God they can heal from the wound we’ve made. 

Unfortunately my mom’s birthday was shortly after this. I decided to leave a card on her porch as we don’t live too far away. She sent me a text later that day saying it was the worst birthday she’d ever had and what could she ever have deserved to have done this. 

I am frustrated at myself bc I responded to her text to reinforce our boundaries when I think I should’ve just let it go. She used my reply as a door to inflict more hurt. Says the rift in creating in our family will be hard to recover from. 

It sucks enough that it’s my parents, who I’ve always been incredibly close to, but they also live close to 15 other family members who are all part of the Q belief system. My husband and I are the only ones on the outside. By setting this boundary with my parents of taking space and time apart we are essentially doing the same to my other 15 family members who unfortunately are probably aware of all of this even though it was a private conversation. 

My husband and I can handle it, but it’s so hard to cut our kids off from so many people they love. Any tips for managing and helping kids get through separations like this?

My dad is so angry bc he says they don’t do anything overtly or talk about Q in front of the kids. But as we all know here it becomes a way of life that infiltrates so many other elements.",QAnonCasualties

1969,[META] The state the sub right now (warning: long),"TL;DR – Sorry this is too important to summarise in a pithy one liner.
 
 
I've noticed a definite shift in the sub’s zeitgeist in the last couple weeks especially. We've experienced a massive increase in subscribers. At the start of this year, we had 56,000 subscribers. Just over 3 weeks later, we now have 98,000 subscribers. In three weeks, we've almost doubled in size. That's fine I'm glad people are finding this place, I really am, don’t think for one second I resent this or you because of what I’m about to say. If you're new, I'm glad you are here, it's nice to meet you, you are most welcome.
 

Many people are resentful of the idea of being nice or empathetic to Qultists, and on the surface of it, why wouldn’t you? The sub is full of Qultists behaving and acting in disgusting inhumane ways. Those are not the Qultists we are advocating empathy towards. It is the more vulnerable, more misguided, subsection of decent people who have been brainwashed by this doomsday cult. If the Qultist in your life did something bad to you, I am sorry. I truly am, but they did it to you. Not me, not the Qultists I’m referring to, they did. Blame them. Blame Q. Blame the rioters at the capital. Please do not blame all Qultists, past or present.
 
I also wanna make one thing clear. Qultists are not interchangeable with White Supremacists/Nazis. I am not white and was a Qultist and am not a white supremacist. Qanon is bad enough without them all out to be as cartoonishly evil as they make the Cabal out to be. Making a group “the other” is an old narrative, just like their blood libel narrative, just like their narrative. Old narratives with new attitudes. It's the same thing when Republicans act like all BLM protestors are the same as the ones who rioted and burned down businesses. 97% of the protests were peaceful, they cannot and should not be talked about as if they were part of one amorphous blob. This is a sub for Qanon Casualties, for victims, we are all victims of Q, and so are the Qultists. They are also victims. That doesn’t excuse their behaviour, that doesn’t free them from the consequences of their actions. But this is not a hate sub. this is not a political sub, this is not a rant sub. There are plenty of other places on reddit to do those things. This is a support group for the casualties of Qanon. Don't forget that.
 

In the coming weeks the Proud Boys, Neo Nazis and other fringe groups are going to recruit from disillusioned QAnon. Those confused, dejected souls whose ""Storm"" never came may be easily recruited into groups that preach that they can make it happen. They will [gravitate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_cult#Psychological_studies/) towards these groups. The Capitol Riots may serve as an example to push some QAnon down that path of action. Isolation, hopelessness, desperation
 

It's a national security issue, it's a widescale public mental health crisis. Q is like a coronavirus of the mind, highly infectious with a low mortality rate. Like any virus its mutating, with different countries having different strains. Some more infectious than others. Now its a race to find a cure before it mutates again into something much more lethal. If we add to their despair, if they think there is nowhere to go, everyone is against them and there is no peer group for them they will join these groups.
 

Q has taken some of their humanity, labelling them as QAnon, telling them they are part of a separate group, trained them to act like sheep (Where We Go One We Go All) and radicalized them with lurid tales of blood and vengeance. We have the power to give them some of their humanity back by forgiving the ones we can and who did little more than post on the internet and make fools of themselves at parties.
 
 
I know that many readers have hard feelings, as an XQ, trust me when I say I truly, deeply, from the bottom of my heart despise them. I know that family members have been relentlessly abused, stressed to the breaking point, so has mine. Something about QAnon appealed to them initially. For some it was the children. For others corruption. For others, the idea of an overarching cabal providing them an element of control they lack in their own lives. The world they see did not match that which they want to see. Many of these folks have taken no action outside words and speech.
 

Soon a subsection may be converted into a force for action. If we do not reconcile with them, reconcile with each other all will get pulled down. Cults and niche groups like the PB and Neo Nazis prey on the isolated, those who feel there is nowhere to go. One of the PB’s tactics is to shame Qultist’s for “trusting the plan” and not “doing something”. That may be highly effective on Qultist’s right now.
 
 
Those we convert back become a force able to help others ease back into the fold. Ask any cult expert, any, and the overwhelming academic opinion is that the best way to deprogram people is to hear from other former cult members. There’s barely a handful of us, we need more. If the community hadn’t responded to me with [open arms](https://reddit.com/r/Qult_Headquarters/comments/c045jw/you_guys_were_right/), I probably wouldn’t be here, and I don’t mean on reddit. This is a unique opportunity, the end of Trump’s term. This is the one natural endpoint that exists within Qanon. There is no other. We will not get another chance like this. Not like this. 
 

Thank you.

1970,Losing my wife,"My first post on Reddit so please bear with me

Wife and I have been married for 12 years and have 2 kids under 5.

Around December 2019 she started to get into the Q stuff and became paranoid someone was going to abduct the kids. After a few months she got over the abduction stuff but became VERY spiritual (Christianity of course). Everything is a spiritual battle and we are living in the end times. Joe Biden represents Satan and evil, and Trump is a good guy that is working very hard to expose corruption of the ""deep state"".

COVID is a weapon created by China and used by our government to exercise control over us. The only reason we wear masks is because the Illuminati wear masks when they meet.

She ""confirmed with God"" that Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau are Satan worshippers, the Pope is working with Satan, and Obama and Hillary are going to be hung. Almost everyone in Hollywood is part of the ""cabal"".

Witchcraft is in almost every movie (especially Disney), and there are secret pedophile symbols in some kids shows.

I am 99% sure there is some kind of mental illness happening here, but she refuses to get evaluated. We have done marriage counseling, but the only counseling she would agree to is through her church, and that has not been very helpful at all. I've been talking to a therapist on my own just to vent sometimes.

The only good thing out of this is that she has kept it away from the kids. She hasn't mentioned any of this stuff to them and I'm grateful for that, even if they are too young to understand anyway.

I feel stuck, if I try to separate I would only do so if I had custody of the kids. But I consulted with a lawyer, and he said that could be difficult to get custody at this point because even though she may say some wild things, she hasn't acted on anything or became dangerous. My best hope is that a judge may order a psychiatric evaluation, but by then it would be too late to salvage the marriage.

She was a great person before all this and I don't know how to get her back.",QAnonCasualties

1972,Does anyone else have hope that all this Qanon stuff will die out?,I think Qanons best tactic is to relate to people who doesn’t have good critical thinking and also people who dont know anything about technology. So my hope is that when the boomers die off its gonna be much better. I also believe that Joe’s presidency will literally just be too boring so people will lose interest in politics. Or atleast it wont be as intense as it was before the inauguration.,QAnonCasualties
1973,My brother has poisoned my family and my Qmom is an enabler,"So, honestly, I need to get this off my chest somehow. I have been dealing with this for years now, and it's been spreading in my family like a poison. The person who has injected this poison is my brother - and he has been becoming increasingly violent, especially towards me, and my family keeps gaslighting me on his behavior.  

Now that I've been moved out for a while with my partner, I'm realizing just how badly they gaslit me, and just how badly it affected my mental health throughout my childhood +  teenage years. For context though, I'm only 19 years old currently. 

My parents have always been very conspiratorial. From aliens and big foot, to deep state and evil democrats. I grew up with all of it.  My brother and I were told to question absolutely everything. To look for facts and to research for ourselves... even if we were told the facts by actual professionals.  

My older brother took this very, very far. And whenever he got older, he reached 4chan. Conspiracies, crazy shit, the works, he reveled in it. Loved it. He then began to tell our parents all about the shit he learned from the internet, and while my dad ignored him, my mom loved it.  She was PROUD of him for going so deep into ""research"" on the internet. He would show her sketchy articles, unverified, filled with rhetoric and dog whistles. My mom didn't pick up on the racist undertones, though, or the whistles. Just thought it was interesting theories. 

He introduced her to Stephen Crowder, Ben Shapiro, alternative media. Convinced her all mainstream news a bunch of lies. She went with it, I think in a way it was her attempt to connect with my brother, something she hadn't really been able to do before.  

Meanwhile, my brother was gaslighting her anytime she questioned the media he provided her with. Adding lies on top of lies to keep her from distancing from it. Its disgusting. He tried to do the same with me, but I was always skeptical and more left-leaning as well as very anti-conspiracy unless there was adequate proof from accredited sources. Whenever I wouldn't fall for it, or call it out, he would get angry with me. 

He started to shun me in a way. And talk to my mom about how he was ""really concerned"" about the path I was going down. Told her he was just so sad I was being deceived.  I would rant to my mom about his pushy ways and how he would try to force his beliefs on me.  ""He's just worried about you,"" she'd say, ""You try to see the good in both sides, but you do need to be careful. You know how they [the ""left""] can be."" 

She would always dismiss my beliefs as irrational as well - when I would show her credible sources. My brother would always come into the conversation to say they weren't reliable because ""You can't trust the feds.""

My brother scares me. He brags about how 4Chan desensitized him, brags about harrassing people and being part of harrassment campaigns, as well as being a nationalist.  He would and does send me sexist and racist memes, to antagonize me, along with suicide bombing videos and gore. I think he does this because he enjoys hurting me, mentally especially, and to get back at me for not siding with him.  

My brother has done this since we were kids. Years ago he would get my dad's gun and aim it at me, threatening to shoot me. Use lighters to trigger me on purpose, light them right next to my hair and clothes, and brag to his friends about it all. My anxiety was horrible living in the same house with him, and he would always try to get my mom to take me off my ""crazy pills"". 

My mom is no solace. While she admitted and admits he's wrong for doing this, she tells me he just loves me. Now with political shit, she says he just wants me to see the truth.  Anytime we have one on one time, when he's not home, all she talks about is QAnon conspiracy bullshit. Election fraud. How Trump can still save us. How Joe is going to be arrested any day now. That u need to get right with God, stock up on food, and charge my phone so I can check for any alerts.  What my brother has shown her. About how the proud boys aren't that bad, actually. 

Not too long ago, I was at my parents. My brother was home. He woke up, came to the living room while I talked to mom about my cats.  Immediately he takes over the conversation and rants about Biden and the Capitol, and how lockdowns are impending. There's going to be a civil war, he said.  I ignored him, and just got on my phone.  

He then asks me: ""Explain something to me, why the fuck are they so scared about the fake virus? It's not even fucking deadly, I haven't seen any packed hospitals.""

We live in a rural area with ridiculously low population size.  Regardless, I point out our state having hospitals packed, pull up the numbers to prove it. Also add that it definitely isn't a fake virus, and it's already shown to have dangerous long term effects on those who have it, even if they're asymptomatic. 

He lost his shit. Yelling at me, asking what happened to me, calling me a bunch of slurs and accusing me of being on the wrong side of history, of supporting pedophiles. Tried to intimidate me, puffing up and acting generally unhinged. I left, and I don't want to go back. My mom actually told me to forgive him, that he's just panicked and tried to get me to pity him.

He poisoned our family. I can't visit anymore because he lives with our parents. Whenever I visit he comes out to bully me threaten. He's twice my size, and I know he would definitely hurt or hit me in a moment of anger. I don't feel safe around him or visiting my parents anymore.  My mom enables him and tells me I need to understand him, on top of filling conversations I have with her with conspiracy. 

I really don't know what to do. I'm honestly ready to threaten him with law interference if he keeps trying to contact me with gore and harrassment. I'm so fucking tired and I don't want to believe this is my family. 

But it is my fucking family. And I feel stuck, and part of me feels guilty for feeling abused or gaslit.  He's even gotten under my skin, along with my mom, about the medication I was prescribed for mental health. I feel like a fucking fake or defect for having to take it to even feel like I can make it another day. 

I'm sorry this is so long. If you're struggling with similar things, please know you're not alone. Seeing all of your stories and how you get through it helps me keep my sanity and from slipping into their deception and for that I'm grateful. We'll get through this, just have to go one day at a time I guess.",QAnonCasualties

1977,My long time friend is becoming a Q and I haven't been able to stop it.,"Sometimes I feel like I get through to her but then she 
""snaps"" back. She wrote me yesterday and told me Covid is fake and a lie. As people here know I am an ex-conspiracy theorist [never a Q or Republican and always hated Trump] so I have my own baggage from this. I have worries the vaccine is going to harm people, I worry about Covid being used for a ""Great Reset"", these are world views that are not easy to totally leave. I do follow all Covid protoccols and in my case I KNOW too many people who got Covid, so believe it is REAL.

She told me she went to three ERs [she does have a lot of health problems] and they were all empty and that Covid is a lie, and she is going to return to living life normally and going shopping and she's done with Covid protoccols. 

She sent me four paragraphs ranting about China and Communists in one email. I am a democratic socialist.  She's not happy with this.

Given I have lost so many friends to deconversion from a fundamentalist Christianity, and whats happening even with this friend, I'm not going to have any friends left. I have fellow UUs in my community but no close friends anymore. 

This is a long distance friendship started online, but been real world, phone calls for 22 years plus.

I am kind of depressed like people have brain worms and I can't save them. 

I blame myself too because she heard some of my former conspiracy and fundamentalist Christianity crap, and it influenced her. [I never supported the right wing though and she's running with that]

I think she's on the way to becoming a fundamentalist Christian [she was jewish] and that's depressing me too.",QAnonCasualties
1978,A note from a fellow conspiracy theorist. (Non-Q),"For those of you who have Q people to deal with, but have never dived down a conspiracy hole personally. I hope my perspective can maybe help with some talk. 

I have always been particularly prone to conspiracy theories, reading obscenely deep into stuff late at night. Doom-scrolling through the bad times and pontificating the end of the good ones. So one would think I would be prime target material for this Q nonsense, however, I have managed to resist it and let me tell you how. Maybe this will bring a new perspective on how to convince these people.

The greatest strength of a conspiracy theorist is that they question everything. The greatest weakness, is that they tend to question stuff that validates their personal viewpoints a little less then they maybe should. (I.E, Oh I don’t trust liberals so I’ll assume this liberal army secretary is involved with war crimes without checking my evidence, but scrutinize similar claims about a conservative.) This is a very very easy pitfall, but it’s important to understand that this urge is normal and simply needs to be recognized. The magnifying glass of doubt needs to be shined on your hopes and fears equally.

The first thing that they need to know is that believing in conspiracies is not crazy. Pedophilic elite cabals exist and we know this. Not to mention that the government does unionize likeminded members in unofficial ways, this is also known and proven many times over. REINFORCE THAT BELIEVING IN THESE KINDS OF THINGS IS NOT CRAZY.

Now the problem bits. 

Real life can be stranger than fiction. The CIA used LSD for insane experiments and literally paid a woman to jack off a dolphin on acid once (yeah someone’s tax dollars paid for that.) However, what is know is know. A few glaring facts may help those who aren’t too far gone. EMPHASIZE NOT THAT THESE ERRORS MEAN THAT THEY ARE DUMB, INSTEAD THEY MAY BE THE FIRST CLUES TO ENLIGHTENING THEMSELVES TO THEIR MANIPULATION. 

-A “Q” clearance level doesn’t mean bupkiss

-The effects of Adrenochrome (the actual substance) have no scientific implication of doing anything to anyone once consumed. This urban myth was popularized by Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. 

-Cloning people doesn’t just happen over night. It would have taken literally cloning someone at birth to have a clone that is the same age as them. 

Now. If your Q is so far gone that you fear these facts will lead to only anger, that’s a pickle. The best advice I can offer is to suggest this possibility:

Pedophilic and corrupt elites exist, and in whatever form it is, public acknowledgement of them is bad. Unless, however, it is controlled and loyally predictable opposition that publicly fails. It would be absolutely awesome for the “deep-state” (or whatever analogous thing exists), if they had a group of angry, confused and terrified people who are delegitimizing the idea of conspiracies. Whatever truths are in the Q story, are brought down by the general public’s negative perception of all of the bullshit that’s strong along with it. Hell, maybe it was a big ol’ sneaky evil plot by the liberals to completely delegitimize a huge chunk of conservatives while splitting their voting base in a irreparable way.  As a conspiracy theorist, this whole thing stinks of high hell of psyop manipulation to me.


Ask them why they have been forced to sit on their hands and trust the plan without being told what’s actually happening before it happens. Ask them why “Q” doesn’t respect them enough to give them clear comforts and not vague promises. Ask them if they have ever had any personal experience with a manipulator that used false hope and false promises as a way to keep their loyalty. 

Ask them honestly, if Trump is the only one against the deep state. Who was keeping the deep state from taking over during Obama’s presidency, and why in the hell would they ever let Trump win, if he wasn’t just as corrupt as any of them.

The bottom line is that they craziest thing about the Q story, is that there is an undefined set of good guys that you just have to “Trust.” 


(Once they have questioned that you can maybe explain how drinking baby blood probably isn’t that good for you, nor too tasty.)

Tl;Dr: Keep being a conspiracy theorist, keep questioning things, never trust a source too much. However, Q is just another form of mass manipulation. Just because it isn’t on TV, doesn’t mean it isn’t manipulation, it’s a new form. The safest way to exist is not to let any sort of media what so ever control or effect your daily life.",QAnonCasualties

It’s an impossible leap from normal common sense to pizzagate- but if you’re already charging crystals by the full moon, and convinced that the engine vapour from airplanes is actually government mind control chemicals, and certain that vaccines cause autism, well, you’re not making an impossible leap to pizzagate.

1980,Does anyone think Stephen King should write about this?,"I understand brainwashing and the complicated dynamics that are involved, but sometimes reading all of these stories of losing loved ones to this mass doomsday cult feels like ""The Stand"".

We donʻt know what the long term impact will be to this, will it peter out like a fascist Harry Potter fandom or will it form into a new religion like the JW? I think this Q thing took off because of peoples fear of the pandemic and it gives them a sense of control over the uncontrollable. 

I think we could, and should, sticky ways of combatting some of this.

1981,QMom (help!),"My mom is gone.

I grew up in a single-parent household with my mother, a strong and independent woman who loved all humans, bought blankets for the homeless, adopted any animal she saw in pain and was genuinely one of the best people.

All that changed with Q. She started with holistic/crystal YouTube videos that rapidly led her down the right-wing rabbit hole into Q. I didn’t realize it at the time but they baited her into it (she won a crystal and suddenly she was a dedicated follower). Her radicalization began slowly with a progression into anti-vaxx ideology. It was around this time that I moved to the other side of the world.

I think the moment that caused her final descent into the paranoid world - her final step of radicalization was losing her business to Covid. Government restrictions and the virus were easy to lash out against when they took away something she so fundamentally loved.

Our relationship has all but ended since this descent, I rescued my sister from her household and had my dad bring her here to Australia. Any interaction with my mother has ended in her getting mad defending her beliefs and telling me to “just look at what’s happening” or “do actual research” (when prompted for her sources she is never able to provide any). 

I penned a long letter about a week before the November election coming out to her and hoping it would be a moment for her to change course and rekindle our relationship. I told her I could not handle her continued belief in a man who fundamentally disagreed with my access to human rights.

That effort was unsuccessful.

1983,Qanon and fascism,"This might be obvious to some of you since Q-anon was essentially born out of fascism, but, in case it's not, you should be aware that:

#There are a *whole fuckin bunch* of parallels between Q-anon and fascism.

I had some dude challenge my definition of fascism when I called the Trump cult fascists, because they are, and this was my response. See 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12 and loosely 14 and apply them to what you've seen from the Q adherents. 

""Well, there are 14 defining characteristics of fascism. Let's go through them one at a time and draw the parallels to trumpism and what used to be the Republican party. 

 1. Rampant nationalism (I would also add unwarranted exceptionalism and isolationism) - Do I even need to say anything for this one? Did Don Jr. tweet something like ""I never see Democrats with American flags hanging in front of their house?"" ......I mean, really, this speaks for itself.

 2. Disdain for an individual's human rights. ""Rapists and murderers"" ""They're not 'sending' their best"" ""You have to go after the families"" At one point we could not find the parents of at least 545 immigrant children, as far as I know that was not resolved, I could be wrong. Regardless, it is indefensible.

 3. Identification of enemies - See #2 ""CaRaVaNs"" This one is particularly damaging because the administration is ignoring real threats (according to our 17 intelligence agencies) so they can point at fake ones. The real threats are Russia, white supremacists and various accelerationist groups like the boogerloo boys. 

 4. Supremacy of the military - We don't have to go any farther than one of these ""subvert democracy and give Donny the election"" protests to see the fetishization of the military. Half of the ding dongs there are wearing plate carriers and carrying ARs. Also, remember Donny's little Kim Jong Un-esque parade? 

 5. Rampant sexism - Donny has 26 rape and sexual misconduct allegations going back decades. 73 million people voted for him after hearing ""grab em by the ______"" come out of his mouth.

 6. Attempted control of mass media - The demonization of the media in this country in the last 5 years is so unbelievably damaging. I don't think we'll ever be able to fix it. I'm thinking of a phrase that rhymes with ""snake coups""

 7. Obsession with security - ....what is being shoddily half built on the southern border that Mexico was never gonna pay for? Did Donny institute a ban on people from countries of a certain faith flying into this country? This one is ironic because Trump is the biggest national security threat since September 2001.

 8. Church and state commingled - Yikes. ""One nation, under God"" Again, this one pretty much speaks for itself if you know anything about politics in this country. Evangelicult has a disgusting amount of lobbying capacity. I mean dude, Betsy DeVos. Betsy. DeVos. Unbelievable.

 9. Protection of corporations - Citizens United, industry lobbyists in regulatory positions in government, massive corporate tax cuts (reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% in 2017). Still waiting for that trickle down, starting to think it might be more of a ""flow up"" model.

 10. Suppression of labor unions - This has been happening for 50 years but, if you want a better idea of the damage this administration and the GOP as a whole have done to the American worker recently, search ""The Economic Policy Institute - How Trump and Congress further rigged the economy in favor of the wealthy"" Also - see #9 and vice versa 

 11. No respect for the arts or intellectuals - Google ""Yale University, Anti-intellectualism in the Trump era"" and read the article by Louis René Beres. ""Colleges spew liberuhl propergander""

 12. Obsession with crime and punishment - ""the Law and Order president"" (lmfao, hilarious from a soon to be felon) ""Lock her up"" How about sending unmarked federal agents to various cities around the country without the consent of that states governing body? ""Let our politicians give back our police department's power to keep us safe. Unshackle them from the constant chant of 'police brutality,' which every petty criminal hurls immediately at an officer who has just risked his or her life to save another's."" Lol, ok, Donny.

 13. Widespread corruption and cronyism - Lol, yea. I'll take from that other comment for this one. Hundreds of hatch act violations. An incalculable number of emoluments violations every day. Extortion of a friendly sovereign nation for dirt on a political rival. We will be uncovering the rampant corruption of this administration for decades. Decades. Who did Donny just pardon these last few days other than war criminals and his step son's dad? Was it, perhaps, multiple co-conspirators of his that colluded with a historically hostile authoritarian foreign nation to get him elected in 2016? Read Malcolm Nance's book The Plot to Betray America: How Team Trump Embraced Our Enemies, Compromised Our Security, and How We Can Fix It. This is the most corrupt administration in the history of the office of the president, by a landslide.

 14. Fraudulent elections - Luckily we live in a country full of little countries that administer their own elections, otherwise, this demagogue might have been able to install himself indefinitely, like his daddy Putin did. Followed by his irreparably stupid kids.""

I’d really like to know how all of this madness and nonsense has changed your opinion/attitude towards your Qanon.","  My father has been into conspiracies including pizzagate and I think even before that. He went from new age to UFOs to conspiracies to more and more radical right-wing beliefs. Qanon is in there. Obviously, he is a Trump fan. He recently switched from Fox News to NewsMax because Fox News didn’t support Trump – some motivated reasoning there. My QAnon/FoxBrain doesn’t talk about the more outlandish things anymore. I think he came to realize his beliefs were too far out of the norm and that maybe it was making him look bad. He falls for everything. He’s got an endless supply of vitamins, some new special water that does something ordinary water does not, fringy doctors, and who knows what else. He’s a total mark. He’s a sucker. He’s obsessed with slowing the aging process when not paying attention to cabals and waiting for Hilary’s arrest. Alex Jones is in there somewhere of course. I think his poor critical thinking abilities have been leading to unwise life and business decisions.

I probably wouldn’t feel so strongly about him if he didn’t try to change my mother, brother, and I’s beliefs to match his. I don’t appreciate how he acts as if he’s the one that really knows what’s going on. He gets angry if his knowledge is challenged. Not too terribly angry, not like I’ve heard from others, but angry enough. Our relationship is mostly ok actually. If his ‘reality’ is tested he then becomes insulting and condescending toward us. My brother and I get accusations that “We are not old enough to understand life as he does.” “Wisdom comes with age.” He likes to say.  “We only pay attention to MSM fake news and are blind.” It’s insulting to our intelligence and I suspect that he thinks we are fools, but probably not as much as I think of him. I don’t want to be around when any conversation about current events comes up. How can you talk with somebody that is hardly on the same planet?  How do you converse with someone when reality is frequently in contradiction to their foolish beliefs and identity and leads to conflict?  It’s totally foolish to try.

My parents have always been extremely conservative. I was homeschooled. We were fundamentalist Christians. Looking back, I’m shocked I was allowed to wear pants, but my dad also didn’t speak to me for a week when I cut my hair short in high school. 

For a while, after I left to college, it seemed like they were getting better. My younger brother would tell me he finally felt safe around my dad, and they had nice, deep conversations. 

Since, trump was elected, it’s gone downhill, but very fast this past year. I try not to go home. The last time was super painful but there weren’t many red flags.

When my brother came out to my mom, I had to beg her not to tell my dad, because I feared that for him. She knew there was a chance he’d be violent and had to be convinced anyway. But when my brother was saying how nice my dad had been to him (without knowing he’s also queer) and that he didn’t seem to hate queer people as much, I had a small glimmer of hope. And when they seemed dandy about me becoming Jewish, I was like, finally, a small speck of love from them. I never felt loved as a kid. For them to not judge me and support me in something was a new emotion for me lmao. 

But like I said, things were getting worse this past year. They said horrible things about BLM protestors, not knowing I had protested on many occasions, but that wasn’t super surprising. I called on the day of the election, and they made concerning comments about Kyle Rittenhouse, that he was a hero and those protestors deserved death. That was not expected. 

Then, out of the blue, my brother asks me over text if my parents have said weird shit about my conversion or Judaism to me. I said no, because they hadn’t. I had to prod him on why he asked but eventually he told me that they were saying all this antisemitic shit behind my back. He definitely was telling the truth, he wouldn’t lie like that, but to be honest, he probably saved the worst stuff so as to not hurt me. Which is heartbreaking, because apparently my dad tried to get me a box of ashes for Christmas and my brother stopped him. 

When he told me this, I sobbed. My dad has made Holocaust jokes around me, in 2019, but I thought “if he knew, he wouldn’t even think that, let alone say it”. Apparently not. When I was a kid, I was severely punished bc I made a joke about gnomes that my parents interpreted as a joke about joining the kkk. (I had gnome pajamas and said smth like “join the gnome clan to my brother”.) they made it super clear that it wasn’t okay, even tho I didn’t understand what they had misunderstood. I realize now, but I was like eight and homeschooled then. My older sister once made a joke about slavery and she was also punished. We were raised conservative and my parents have always held hateful and bigoted beliefs, but for some reason, never tolerated it in us. 

I’ve been prodding him more since, and turns out, my dad has adopted a lot of white nationalist beliefs. I explained a lot of Nazi rhetoric to my brother and he confirmed on many points that my dad believes that. And again, my brother is also a queer leftist and abused my parents, so he avoids them. So I can’t imagine what they’re saying when he’s not around. 

When Covid started, both of my parents were anti mask. My mom has been somewhat of an antivaxxer for some time, but recently became more hardcore with it. As a kid, my mom was diligently “anti pagan” and we weren’t allowed to read Harry Potter, but in recent years, seemed to loosen up. She has all these crystals, practices “manifesting”, all this kind of gwenyth Paltrow goop shit. Apparently my brother did not know what q anon was, but when I asked and explained it, he was like “oh! Mom went to some kind of meet up with people like that”. He said she definitely bought into a lot of stuff in line with it. She was on parler. As far as I know, she was not at the capitol, but Jesus fucking Christ. 

I feel devastated. I keep telling my friends and they’ll laugh. I don’t know how they think it’s a joke. I can’t explain how it feels. You have to take a few classes on Judaism before you convert and they explicitly talk about rising antisemitism, and the hate you will most certainly get. I didn’t expect it to come from my parents. I didn’t expect my parents to joke about genocide. I feel so alone. I didn’t go home for Christmas but I don’t want to go home ever again now. I have this (possibly irrational) fear that they’re gonna hurt me if I do. I’m afraid they’ll hurt my brother for no reason.",QAnonCasualties

Why on earth would you ever want to stay with someone like that? Why would you want to be with a racist, white nationalist unless you also are too?

1988,This is not the first time. It's cyclical.,"Unfortunately it never goes away.

I am a very logical and pragmatic person. I have read enough of these types of allegations and have spent days following the trail of listed evidence by the believers, however the evidence that always has an initial polished veneer of truthiness always dissolves into the ether once you dig deeper for actual facts. 

Yes, there are evil people out there. Yes, sometimes they are wealthy and powerful, and sometimes they are enabled by others that are well connected. Some of them are governmental officials. 

There are unfortunately a lot of gullible, sometimes despite being well educated, people who easily accept veneers of truth and the perceived webs of connections beneath, without researching to find out that these are relatively isolated groups of creeps that pander to each other. 

Anyone that can look at Trump, and see a christ like saviour in the least christ like person to hold the office of president, is truly delusional.  

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial

The McMartin preschool trial was a day care sexual abuse case in the 1980s, prosecuted by the Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner. Members of the McMartin family, who operated a preschool in Manhattan Beach, California, were charged with numerous acts of sexual abuse of children in their care. Accusations were made in 1983, arrests and the pretrial investigation took place from 1984 to 1987, and trials ran from 1987 to 1990. The case lasted seven years but resulted in no convictions, and all charges were dropped in 1990. By the case's end, it had become the longest and most expensive in American history. The case was part of day-care sex-abuse hysteria, a moral panic over alleged Satanic ritual abuse in the 1980s and early 1990s. 


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse

Satanic ritual abuse (SRA, sometimes known as ritual abuse, ritualistic abuse, organized abuse, or sadistic ritual abuse) is the subject of a moral panic (often referred to as the Satanic Panic) that originated in the United States in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s, and persists today. Allegations of SRA involved reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in the context of occult or Satanic rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a global Satanic cult that includes the wealthy and powerful world elite in which children are abducted or bred for human sacrifices, pornography, and prostitution.",QAnonCasualties

1992,My mom went at it again and brought me some knawledg,"Story time for you, my lads.

**Context:** Canadian. I live alone with my mom who is anti-masker and anti-vaxxer (since I'm young apparently, which I was only made aware last year by my dad), but has also fell hard into Q. She's been in it for months, I can't remember when it started. But I have since been avoiding her in the house and I only see her when she wants to confront me.

It's about 8:00 PM, today. I was cooking some veggies and doing a few chores in the kitchen. I must have made too much noise because my mom went bolting from upstairs to tell me how things were in her Q world. Before inauguration, she was thinking Biden would be arrested by the military on the 20th, but low and behold she still figured how to change her narrative.

Now, apparently DC is not part of the United States, but is a city state such as Monaco, and also a corporation ruled by The Vatican and The City of London (the District, not the city). So Biden would be effectively the President of The Corporation of the United States of America. But Trump dissolved the said corporation on the 4th July 2020, and therefore, Biden would not be at the head of the United States of America. But at the head of a dead corporation.

When I brought up that the US was not a Catholic country... she said Vatican was in fact not Catholic, and then she implied that they were a bunch of Satanists because they owned two satellites respectively named Lucifer 1 and Lucifer 2 (a quick Google search reveal that here are no satellites which such a name, but a telescope in Arizona does, which is cool as heck). She then proceed to tell me that it is through those said telescopes that the votes were switched during the election.

I was asking questions about her arguments, because honestly, it was quite boring, and might as well see where her reasoning steamed from. She went around about how the internet censor things, and that everything that showed truth was conveniently deleted or hidden. After that I lost track because my brain didn't have any more power and I wanted to eat my goddamn asparagus.

It ended with her angrily asking question about if \[something\] was normal. I said I didn't know because I honestly wasn't listening. She then wished me to suffer as a slave because I deserved it (she thinks the Elites are going to enslaves us, from a previous conversation). 

I know my mom has way more ""knowledge"" than that, but I didn't let her go into it because I asked to take a break, that I was honestly tired and that if she wanted to talk, I'd be able to listen once the asparagus were cooked (10 mins). When I came back up in the kitchen, she was nowhere to be found.

The follow-up was a few irritated that I promptly looked at to see what they were all about, then deleted them.

1996,I’m just exhausted at this point.,"I don’t know that my family would consider themselves “QAnon” but they definitely follow Trump’s conspiracies closer than they claim to follow Jesus. Even as I’m typing this I worry about their reputations... But then I remember that my hurt is valid. I’m in therapy because of my childhood. We went to a pretty extreme church for a good portion of my childhood. I tell people it was a cult and they smirk, thinking I’m just being dramatic because I wasn’t a part of the Manson family. The cult leaders started programming us in Sunday School at 3-4 years old threatening us with supernatural violence if we stepped out of line with a god who could supposedly smite us and send us to a pool of lava that would never stop burning. Because that’s what you tell a preschooler right? These are some of my first memories. In high school I became anorexic. I would lock myself in my closet to fast and pray, missing meals for fear if I stopped praying something bad would happen. My negative thoughts became so strong I thought I was hearing voices. I was told this anxious development was god talking to me, and I should embrace it. It was killing me, yet I was told it was my only medicine. It’s funny how religious extremism and the current political state go hand in hand. The difference? I got help. I got out. While my family left that specific church, the core beliefs are there and although they parade as “virtue” and “righteousness”, I know what they are. They’re hate, more commonly known as the -isms. I know in their hearts they think they will protect me by forwarding these “deep truths” and trying to convert me back every time we talk. I’m told I don’t know about the real world, and that the devil has pulled the wool over my eyes because my ballot is blue. They watched me struggle to get healthcare under the Trump administration and blamed free-loading immigrants stealing up all the resources. I’ve bit my tongue through so many speeches about god’s wrath toward BLM “terrorists” and feminists while their golden calf, Trump, has more abuse allegations than I can think of and their “patriots” carried out one of the most treasonous terrorist attacks in history. Although that was antifa, right? Or maybe it was little green men in people suits at this point? I can’t be bothered to keep up. It was different when they just shared memes of how you look at any given logo a certain way and the symbol of the beast is somehow in all of it. This- all of the everything we’re seeing today- is exhausting. It doesn’t feel like going home. It feels like part 1,000 of the sermon that goes, “Everything is going to hell in a hand basket and if Jesus doesn’t come save [them] in the rapture then Trump will!” It. Is. Exhausting. Biting my tongue and trying to establish boundaries when I just want to feel loved and accepted is hard enough. My inner child feels like she’s being completely invalidated over and over again because she feels like the sinful hellion the adults told her she was in Sunday School class every week. My family doesn’t even know I’m the bisexual, witchy heathen they’re talking about when they hiss about how those “LGBT-ABCDEFG” will have their fiery lot handed to them when they’re thrown from heaven. My inner empath remembers being conditioned to spitting out the same response to a thousand different questions, and it hurts to know these people are a product of the same conditioning. Then I remember it’s not my job to repeatedly explain why hate is hateful or to expose my true identity, buying myself more lectures about my eternal soul. I am who I am... But I am also exhausted.",QAnonCasualties

1998,I hate it so much but it’s also what it is,"TW: abuse / rape / Q

Sooooooo

My dad / sperm donor / abusive POS:

My q person had a tough shake at life. They were adopted into an abusive family and I believe they were most likely introduced to a sexual predator at a very young age (11-13ish?) by another adoptive brother. His adoptive mother is god damn insane. She showed up to my 8th grade graduation uninvited and gave off strong prostitution vibes (Im pro sex worker/legalization—she wasn’t appropriate). She took 500 flyers of my dads arrest record and threw them to the wind on my street in the 90s. When I was a god damn child. 

This person is my dad but he has refused to seek help from his trauma and instead has passed it along to me. When I was 13/14 he made an offensive remark and me as the teen girl I was, ran out of the house. He chased me, tackled me and tried pulling me back to the house, pulling at my jeans so they were falling off of me (below waist) in front of neighbors who knew me. 

He has told me many ways, very specific ways, to kill myself. Which specific chemicals to mix and how to seal the bathroom door. I am terrified one day he will find where I live. I haven’t pursued a restraining order bc of how difficult that is. I know he’s in Montana but I don’t have his address. 

He cyber stalks my family and pops up out of the blue every so often. He was a proud gay man with a partner of like 15 years and now he’s a fucking racist piece of shit q person. Hashtagging #itsoktobewhite. He is denying he ever was gay. His Twitter says “family values first”.  I hate that he couldn’t be out in the Midwest when he needed to be. I hate he never had a support system. I hate that hurt people hurt people and he is a vile god damn piece of shit. He is too pretty to ever want for a couch to sleep on.
