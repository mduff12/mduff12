Little background information, I live in New York state with my wife and kids. My parents live in Wisconsin, which is where I grew up. We try to FaceTime with them every night so that they can read a story to our kids. A couple months ago we noticed my parents seemed different. They didn't seem excited to talk to the kids, they just seemed sorta blah. Then, finally, back in January, the floodgates opened. One day my mom started sending me all kinds of links and pictures from ""research"" she had done online. I didn't realize it at the time but everything she was sending me was Q related. At first I was polite and just tried to brush it off, telling her I did not want to discuss politics or hear about any of this stuff she was saying. Eventually she started getting more confrontational, telling me that I was oppressing her and her beliefs. She began insulting me, telling me that I can't really backup my beliefs and that I was blinded and close-minded. Finally, I exploded into an anti-Trump diatribe. She shot her fake research and delusions back at me, I told her these aren't political beliefs, they are a mass delusion and a cult. She wouldn't stop talking so I hung up on her. I realize I didn't handle it the best way, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I reached out to my aunt who is closest to my mom and found out that my mom hasn't talked to her in weeks over my aunt saying something bad about Trump on social media. Fast forward, my mom has mentioned that she is upset at my grandma for getting the Covid vaccine because she thinks it's going to kill her (another Q delusion.) We called my grandma last night to talk to the kids, and she mentioned that she wanted to speak to me in private. She had tears in her eyes and seemed upset about something. I called my grandma today and found out that my mother has been berating her about everything Q related. My grandmother keeps telling her that she doesn't believe in this and it upsets her to hear about it but my mother won't listen. My grandmother told me that my mom wants to come stay with her for a week, and with her voice shaking, she told me that she doesn't want her to. My grandmother can't take a whole week of my mother trying to brainwash her and tell her all these upsetting things. It was the most heartbreaking phone call I have ever been a part of. My grandma is 92 years old, she has survived Covid, the loss of her husband, multiple bouts with cancer, she is a goddamn survivor who doesn't need or deserve this. At this point, I am just completely at a loss. My grandmother told me she feels like she lost her daughter and I feel like I lost my mother. Reading other people's stories has helped a little but at this point I am afraid we may never get my parents back.

Recently though he’s started watching a lot of Steven Crowder. And today he started talking to me about a video he watched on YouTube about voter fraud... and some blog he read online about how ballots were delivered to the processing building in the cover of night and that people were registered with fake addresses....

I️ feel like he’s creeping into fishy territory. And he can be a little impressionable. He doesn’t really fact check this info and his base response to things is to lean conservative. He says he doesn’t believe it all until he learns more about it but idk if I️ totally believe that. 
I’m just worried he’s gonna slide down a slippery slope to Q anon stuff and wacky, hateful conservative conspiracies. 

What can I️ do? I’m left leaning and I’ve been sharing podcasts and articles that have been as neutral as I️ can get so he’ll read them. Like, the podcast Left Right &amp; Center. Just so he can hear the opinions and reasoning of all sides. But he still hasn’t tried checking all those out.

Tbh this makes me really nervous. Previously I️ wouldn’t have really been bothered by differing political beliefs in a partner, back when it was “one party wants a bridge built in 3 months, one wants a bridge built in 7 months.” But now I️ feel like the parties are separated by moral differences. Which worries me because I️ can see him getting sucked into more hateful stuff and I️ don’t wanna lose him to that kind of propaganda. 

We’ve talked about this a little before. We both try to stay neutral on politics until we have the full picture, which I appreciate. But my natural inclination is to lean left, for him it’s right I️ think. If he were to take a sudden nose dive into like homophobia, nationalist, xenophobic territory I’d call it off immediately- fortunately it’s not there. 

Any advice on how I️ can combat this? Do I️ need to combat this? I️ don’t think he’s gonna believe that Jews with space lasers are gonna rule the world, but he’s not immune from right wing propaganda - especially because he doesn’t have a lot of life experience.

You all understand the confusion, pain, heartbreak, feelings of hopelessness, and tug-of-war between loving someone and watching the person you love erode in front of your eyes. I have despaired, cried, laughed (the humor in some comments has made things more bearable) along with you, and drawn healing from your sharing; so thank you. 

I write today with a question that has often entered my mind as I read our stories of struggle and loss. It’s the flip-side of the question: Why are people vulnerable to Q narratives? My question, instead, is: What made you immune?

If you’re like me, you probably tried reading and researching just to understand your loved one. What made you stop short and say: I won’t go further.?

I know, when discussing Q, there are objective yardsticks for measuring the descent into unreality. But, I’m more interested in the individual subjective experience of those who resist. I am also an academic and understanding this phenomenon has been one way I have dealt with my personal Q loss.

Trying to understand my partner’s beliefs certainly lead to crumbs of truth that would not have landed on my plate had I not made an effort to understand my Q partner. But, the crumbs didn’t amount to enough for me.

I’m guessing each of us had our moments of disbelief where we had to draw the line, however painful doing that was. I know, for myself, I struggled long with guilt wondering if I was doing the right thing by giving up, trying to understand with each new Q belief why my partner could go there. I’m wondering if you care to share what that experience of discovering your limit was for you. 

In a more general way, I think my question is about the future of the Q universe (which has already started to divest from the Q label). This sub keeps growing everyday and so do movements around the world that draw energy from Q and Q-adjacent narratives. Wealth, education level, family situation seem to matter little in predicting who is vulnerable. Hence, I think, my interest in understanding the other side of vulnerability. 

What prevents some of us from burrowing into the rabbit holes? What made you stop short?

I had the privilege of not really caring about politics and considered myself neutral on most issues, but really because I didn't care to do more research. I was a teenager and didn't consider politics to be very important. 

Around late high school, early college I realized my views were definitely more left-leaning. Having different political views from my family didn't bother me at all in the beginning, I figured we'd agree to disagree and move on. Oh no. Despite my family posting conservative Facebook posts frequently (I would never comment on their posts no matter how much I disagreed), the moment I would post anything even implying a left-leaning view, my relatives would always comment and tell me I was wrong.

 One particular Aunt was even worse. She said I was ""seeing the world through rose-colored glasses"" for celebrating the legalization of gay marriage in the United States (this particular comment cut deep because I am a closeted bisexual), she would share articles that I had shared onto my Facebook page, put them on her page and tag me onto the post saying things like ""my niece shared this and I want everyone to see this ridiculous crap"", for people I didn't know to comment and call me an idiot. 

I tried my best to cut ties with that part of the family, but I'll still see my Aunt's posts from time to time (I help out with my mom's Facebook time to time and my mom is still friends with her, so her posts pop up often). My aunt has gotten severely worse.

She frequently posts things about COVID-19 being a hoax, bragging about not wearing a mask, etc. She is also still extremely homophobic and transphobic. She believes the election was a fraud. She bragged about being a conspiracy theorist. Her Facebook account was actually disabled because she would frequently post hateful shit and pure misinformation, but she just created a new account and hasn't stopped posting the same garbage. The last thing she posted was about how the COVID vaccines are dangerous and a hoax. 

She has 3 daughters, the oldest being 14 and starting to share her views.

I feel so very sad that she has doubled down and is on QAnon's side (she hasn't outright said she's apart of it, but all of her posts make me believe so).

X often mentioned 'pizzagate' and paedophile rings being exclusive to Democratic party candidates

X tried to convince myself that the Capital riots were orchestrated by Antifa members

X tried to convince me that the election was stolen from Trump and he was a faultless person

X repeatedly spoke about Hunter Bidens laptop and 'incriminating evidence'

X would use words such as 'Communist' and 'Socialist' as an insult/to describe people such as AOC and Bernie Sanders. People X deemed spineless and undesirable

X would go as low as mentioning the unattractiveness of Antifa members and how they are misfits of society

X would label groups such as BLM and Antifa as terrorists.

X would tell me that the media lies, unless it supports X's view and that random sources in social media are credible

X would state that being maskless is freedom from being a sheep and vaccinations are high in dangerous metals

Colleague Y who I didnt speak to much placed money on Trump winning the election and has even more bizarre views than X

Friend Z referred to AOC as a demon and when asked why, Z told me that she lies

It was amusing at first, but now he's going around maskless plenty of the time, completely ignoring science expert, policy maker, and 90% of the world's consensus that you shouldn't be traveling or hanging out. 

The other day he texted me, he found out he had had Covid-19 about 3 months ago, explaining the lung issues he thought were his ALREADY PRE-EXISTING LUNG ISSUES (how reckless and stupid can you get??), but never apparently got checked out for.

When I urged him to be extra cautious now that he's already weakened by both Covid-19 damage to the lungs (which he should recover from, his doctor says), and his pre-existing lung issues, he only had this to reply:

""I believe we need to build immunity"".

I'm just furious. My roommate, one of my best and dearest friends, the nicest guy you'd ever meet, who would give you the shirt off his back, the food from his fridge and the last dollar in his wallet, just because you asked, lost his father last year to Covid.

I'm seething that people like my Dad are throwing caution to the wind and endangering people left and right because of this or that bullshit internet theory that tells them not to trust the experts, that it's all a conspiracy.

The sad fact is, my roommate's Dad did everything right, took every precaution, and he died because of people like my Dad, who will continue to brazenly put others at risk.

I'm sure I'm saying this out of anger and frustration, and may regret it in the future, but honest to God in this moment I wish it was my Dad that died instead of my roommate's.

At first, I thought they were only being mildly influenced. I thought that since they weren't forcing everyone to believe them, or get away from them, and because they don't scream, accuse, or plot that they were just getting tidbits through their church and Facebook connections. 

A few nights ago, I heard and saw a lot more of their world, and it's a mixed bag because on one hand, I'm really grateful that they aren't frothy and full of ultimatums. On the other hand, it's disappointing and overwhelming to see how surrounded I am by Q influence, and how it compromises their ability to be rational. 

I was shocked to hear a relative go on about how Trump is still secretly in charge, Biden is a doppelganger, and it's all part of a ""larger plan,"" they have faith in. Then, I sat with them as they watched tv, and there's apparently an evangelical tv station specific to the state we live in that featured a whole platform for the My Pillow guy. He really seems to have recently claimed Christian evangelical affiliation to cash in on sales, but he's seen as a blessed guy with inside knowledge. 

These relatives were born in the late 40s. They understand the internet and data caps, are learning about bitcoin, know how to stream, have run businesses, and aren't confused about how to use their phones. They're not stupid, don't reject technology out of hand, and read more than the bible alone. 

Their true sole connection to this stuff is their faith, and church community. They believe all this stuff has to do with god, and godly values. I know it's popular to see all faith and church as inherently stupid and flawed, but I don't agree. In fact, I feel that people's unwillingness to try to find a peaceful compromise between rationality and religious philosophy has given these irrational nightmares the power to flourish.  

My Q family knows I don't hold with Christian or conservative views, and still loves me. They're loving, family oriented people. It's still scary to know that they're waiting for some fantastical conspiracy to unfold. It's disturbing that they could influence minds that are less rational than their own.

lurking here for close to a year but I haven’t posted because my story just seems so close to everyone else’s I didn’t feel that I needed to. Now I need the personal support if possible, I’m just so mad at my mom and the fact that she’s gotten sucked into this and doesn’t seem to care about anything else anymore. (On mobile so sorry about formatting yada yada)

About a week ago I found out a friend had passed away back in November - he was homeless and didn’t have much family left so I only found out because I was checking in on his Facebook and found a bunch of posts from other people who knew him sending their condolences. Anyway, this is the second friend of mine to pass in the last like three months and I texted my mom to let her know and maybe get a little comfort but I haven’t heard from her at all since then. I figured she was busy and would call when she could and cry with me but instead this happened: my brother sent a dumb meme of the Pope holding up an Avril Lavigne CD to our little family Instagram group and my mom sent a message IMMEDIATELY saying something along the lines of “is this the Pope finally acknowledging the existence of clones..??”

I just got so mad... She has the time to spew conspiracy theories when a stupid meme is sent but no time to even offer the slightest comfort to her daughter. I don’t really know what to do, haven’t talked to her about it because I just don’t have the energy to go down the rabbit hole with her right now, not ever but especially right now. 

She’s been conspiracy minded since before I was born so there’s no hope of talking her out of it as far as I’m concerned, but at least when it was chem trails and fluoride in the water and whatever else it really wasn’t harmful... Now it’s baby eating satanists and clones and blah blah blah you all know... I just needed the vent I think, I’m so thankful for this space. I just really really hate that we even need this space though...

Yes, we’re not perfect, but QPerson (Boomer extraordinaire) is almost rabid in her hatred of us to the point that it’s really just straight up supremacy (she and her WASP-y family have always been very elitist with no reason to be other than maybe some vague old-money connections). That being said, I think she hates my generation because Tucker Carlson probably told her to...

My QPerson also *hated* RBG and is glad she’s dead because she was “an ugly, evil Jewish woman who tried to lower the age of consent!” And of course the ‘wrinkled’ flag on RBG’s casket absolutely 100% signaled that she was a traitor, despite there being no evidence whatsoever to back up this ridiculous claim, and even then it’s obviously just conspiracy bullshit.

So I, as a female in her late-20’s, became concerned about the appointment of that bitch Amy Barrett to SCOTUS—  and who with a functioning uterus wouldn’t be??? If this woman had her way, people could serve life sentences in prison for accidental miscarriages. She is a fascist, authoritarian, Christian extremist piece of shit (and this is coming from a good lapsed Catholic whose family is from New Orleans).

But my QPerson, though she has some feminist views and isn’t totally on board with Barrett (to be fair), turns one helluva blind eye to everything about this woman. The weird sex cult, the authoritarian views, the rushed confirmation...anything that would trigger a Q-Idiot if the dEmOnRaTs had pulled it. But nope...here’s QPerson overlooking all of that because she thinks Barrett is more conventionally attractive than RBG and a Christian.

My Qultist keeps telling me not to worry about Roe v. Wade, saying that if it gets overturned, it’ll go to the states, and they’ll decide. Fine, but I pointed out that Roe v. Wade shouldn’t even be up for discussion at this point. It’s *my* body...NOT God’s, NOT my husband’s, NOT the fetus’s, and sure as hell NOT the fucking states’. But QPerson told me I was overreacting, and basically answered, “If they *do* overturn Roe v. Wade, it’ll be to fight the Deep State!” No it won’t...it’ll be because this country harbors some goddamn deep-seated misogyny and wants to punish women for having sex in any way they can. If they really gave a shit about unborn babies’ lives, they’d be advocating to control men’s bodies, too. Not that I think anyone’s body should be controlled, but...at least have there be some consistency?

Anyway, it took me a bit before I finally realized that my QPerson, aside from her obvious fascist tendencies, just plain doesn’t want any younger women having rights. What does she care...she’s in her mid-60’s. New abortion laws won’t affect her. Besides...*her* perfect generation was the one that jump-started feminism (never mind the Suffragettes, I guess). So, I finally snapped at her during a heated discussion one day and said, “You just hate my generation and want to see us punished for something! That’s why you like Amy Barrett.”

And to that my Qultist replied, in a condescending tone with her nose in the air, “Yeah...there’s some truth to that! Your liberal generation is very spoiled, and it’s high time you all got put in your place on something.” That something being...basic human rights. She doesn’t want the world to be a better place for future generations; she wants to see us suffer under authoritarianism because we’re not as racist, sexist, homophobic, and anti-Semitic as she is, and we don’t worship Donald Trump enough.

As a student, I’m tired of hearing stories from young people who have lost family members to “Q”. As a veteran, I’m tired of hearing about people I used to know who have joined a paramilitary organization after being recruited online from a QAnon forum. To an extent, I believe the advice that not arguing about doctrine or facts with adherents is essentially correct[\[i\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn1), but also misses a key component of what people *can* do about QAnon. Namely, demand the prosecution of the individual(s) who radicalized their loved ones in the first place: “Q”. 

It is rare that a cult is judged to be illegal in the United States, as they are shielded by the religious exercise protections of the First Amendment[\[ii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn2). Instead, successful prosecution typically hinges around charging their leaders for tangential crimes, such as kidnapping or forced imprisonment when they hold members against their will. Regardless of whether QAnon should be considered a cult, the same strategy for prosecution should be pursued. If successful, some people may finally walk away from QAnon. Perhaps more importantly, others may never be radicalized in the first place. 

Former President Trump was recently impeached for inciting a riot at the US Capitol based on his language to supporters. I don’t raise this as a political point, but instead to suggest that “Q” could easily be charged under a similar statute[\[iii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn3). “Q”’s 5000 posts, evidence for such a case, have already been catalogued and preserved[\[iv\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn4) by their followers, whether they originally appeared on 4chan, 8chan, or 8kun. Moreover, much of the work of identifying “Q” has already been done by reporters using open-sourced information[\[v\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn5)[\[vi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn6)[\[vii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn7). If the government did decide to pursue legal action against “Q”, naming them wouldn’t require much additional effort. Remember - just because you rob a bank in a mask doesn’t mean you haven’t committed a crime. 

To that end, what I hope you’ll consider doing is writing your elected representatives and asking them what they are doing to prosecute “Q”[\[viii\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn8). When you write, help them understand that “Q” is a single account run by an individual or a small team, and that all QAnon theories are held together by this single linchpin.  Tell them that “Q” is not a novelty or a curiosity. They are a dangerous criminal, and they are still at large. To find the representative for where you live, follow this [link](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and enter your home address. Information about your senators can be found [here](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). If you have never written an elected official before, here are some additional pointers on how to effectively communicate with [legislators](https://www.aclu.org/writing-your-elected-representatives). Be direct, be specific, and tie it to your personal experiences wherever possible. It doesn’t even have to be a letter in the traditional sense; all representatives accept comments from their constituents through their websites. Moreover, if you live in a state where similar activity has occurred at a statehouse or governor’s mansion, consider writing local representatives and asking them what they are doing to prosecute under state laws. 

If charging “Q” for the Capitol riots sounds far-fetched, consider Officer Eugene Goodman, one of the heroes of January 6th. The rioter who led the charge against him was not dressed in political merchandise or waving a MAGA flag. Instead, he wore a black sweatshirt embolized with “Q” on it. According to the FBI, he had purposely positioned himself at the head of the mob – “He wanted to have his t-shirt seen on video so that ‘Q’ could ‘get the credit’”[\[ix\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn9). If foreign insurgents had stormed a military outpost with flags and shirts with “Q” all over them, we would know the identities behind the pseudonym already. 

Until “Q” is prosecuted, these tragedies will only continue, and more people will lose family and friends to the fringe. QAnon is already looking to March 4th as the next flashpoint[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn10), but there will always be another date until our leaders act. The House of Representatives came close to this realization a few months ago, when they voted to condemn QAnon and other fringe conspiracy movements[\[xi\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/submit#_edn11). However, this condemnation lumped “Q” and those “Q” deceived together. By specifically targeting and prosecuting “Q”, we can begin to recognize those people as victims rather than criminals while simultaneously cutting off a recruiting tool for future extremists. I hope you will write and demand justice, both for yourselves and those too far gone to demand it themselves. As much of a long-shot as it might seem, it might be the best way to get them back.

This is incredibly long and rambly, but maybe it will help someone. I'm mostly just typing it up for myself.

I found this sub about a month ago, and it made me pretty depressed. It was obvious that this is what had gotten into my SO of 4 years during covid. Over the summer, he got more interested in ""politics"", decided he was a libertarian now, and was visibly more angry and depressed (but never violent/physical, or anything towards me, I just didn't like his moodiness). I heard about redpills, new world order, technocracy, microchips in vaccines, and 5G. Most of the crazier-sounding bits were kept to himself, like he'd say something vague like ""all politicians are evil"" (to which I was like ""duh"" or ""of course""). All of the jargon sounded like nonsense, I brushed most of it off and said I didn't like to talk about politics with him. Mostly he just wouldn't shut up about it and wouldn't stop listening to it and it wasn't nice conversation. I told him that I couldn't be his politics buddy and that's okay, we can be partners without that, he needs to hang out with friends more and talk about this stuff with them instead. He never talked about Q directly.

When I found this sub it was a huge relief to find out what was happening, where it was all coming from. It was also very concerning with wtf he's gotten into! Even now, reading some of the more intense stories on here can make me really question my future with this man. Some days I try to figure out how things would go if we broke up (we aren't married but we live together and our lives are very intertwined). It's really hard not having him to talk to about this since I don't have many friends and don't see them with the pandemic going on. 

But I've learned a lot from all of you. I started to listen to him a little more. I told him that gaslighting me into thinking I disagreed with him only because I ""didn't know"" wasn't fair and I told him I plan to get the vaccine. I started disagreeing with him on specific points (just like ""that doesn't seem likely"" or ""what if that doesn't happen"" or just straight up ""I don't think that is true""). I've started googling the people he listens to (which seems really icky and dishonest, as does posting here!). I've gotten more insight into where he stands on things and we've started having date nights and I started trying to distract him away from his podcasts and computer outside of work hours as much as possible.

Whenever he suggests moving to a specific place or changing something about our life I question how genuine it is - is this him wanting this or did people on the internet suggest it? In reading a lot of the posts here I realized eventually that I just need to recognize my boundaries, which has mostly turned into me not being open to changing our original plans. But if he insists on breaking the law or making a change that I don't want, I will draw the line - either by telling him that this is not okay or by ending things then. This realization of my own boundaries made me feel a lot better overall. The problem with this (and what I've been trying to return to normal) is that now \*I'm\* not open to new ideas about our life together! I've been clinging to our original plans so much that I'm not considering alternatives like I normally would. 

For awhile I feel like I was faking everything just trying to figure out what was going on while remaining as supportive as I could. But I feel like as I understand things more I can see \*him\* again. He has some crazy ideas, but he's always had crazy ideas. I love his ability to question the status quo. I hated that he was angry about everything all the time and obsessed with his podcasts. Those things still happen but they are less frequent (as long as he isn't just hiding them now). 

I've learned how he got into all of this between documentaries and listening to him (and eavesdropping on his podcasts...). He is a tech-savvy, religious white dude who always wanted to quit his job and go live in the woods. There is a very specific group catering to these guys as part of the alternative medicine type Qs. I believe him when he says he has started to focus on the real content - stuff about things we've always watched. But it's like he's watching stuff we've always been into with ads for Q baked in or something. It's so hard to separate for me, whenever I see him listening to podcasts or watching whatever the hell platform the videos he's watching are on, I think he's just being further indoctrinated. But I have hope that it's not all pure Q stuff. It's never been like 100% of the most crazy theories like some of the rest of the people written about here, but a lot of the main ideas are there. It's like they cater to certain people by filtering out the less-believable stuff. 

He told me at some point that he no longer things that there are chips in the vaccine. But he still hates most vaccines. He bought some crypto, but not much and I convinced him to also save money in traditional USD as well. We have a small stock of food that I think is reasonable to be prepared for any disaster. We talk more and have date nights and have committed to going outside as much as possible as the weather gets better. Sometimes he talks about moving to a specific state (which I think is because of taxes or laws or something) and I remind him that we like the area we already picked.

My only real issue is the thing where we are having a discussion and his brain gets stuck on a Q thing that he has to tell everyone about, which interrupts me or others, or ignores where a conversation is going to go back to what is stuck in his brain. But he has this issue anyways (pre-Q). I'm trying to get better at calling him out. Sometimes he doesn't hear something like ""I need you to run the dishwasher after dinner"" because he's thinking about Q things, and then \*real\* things don't get done. It's frustrating but he knows he does it and is getting less argumentative when I call him out. It does feel like the anger is subsiding, at least a little bit.

I still love him. Besides ""politics"", we've always been a great match (as most of the other Qs, he's always been right-leaning). He hasn't done anything but be angry and repeat things he's heard and he was a victim of this nonsense (I'm including the gaslighting in the ""repeating"" part, we all know that's drilled into them!). And as far as I can tell, this subset of ideas was never the homophobic/racist/etc bunch, at least on the surface. They at least \*think\* they're doing things for the greater good. It's exhausting having to shut down theories or ideas one by one and I get scared and confused whenever I read some of the posts on here (I literally have to keep myself off of this sub sometimes, it can be as addicting as Q itself, lol). But the lines of communication are wide open and he's been very receptive to my points. I think he realizes what is at stake.

When I think about it, my brain immediately sludges down to one point of consciousness, &amp; that’s me remembering to breathe. And it’s not even a good belief. Let’s try it out with some other big belief: Mom might say, “People should have freedom of religion. I don’t even have to listen to your arguments; you’re simply wrong. I will never agree with whatevTHIS is,” gestures to the scattered supplies &amp; a booklet entitled, “pipebomb making at home, by boys club press.” OK now in that formula, sure you’d see the mom’s viewpoint. “He kept breaking into the house &amp; stealing stuff. What could I do? I had to change the locks.” But....that Democrats are evil? That’s it? 

I’m her only child. My child is her only grandchild. I think she’s about ready to disown me, &amp; probably not will me the land I grew up on. We’re from rural Alabama. Family is everything there. Moved north for work when I was a kid. To PA, which I recently heard is called Alabama North. That’s about right, I’ll tell you. Still, I feel my mom raised me to be fair, to see people equally. She had discomfort with this in person, but it was clearly the goal she reached for, for both of us. 

She remarried some years ago. Her husband was from right down the road. Ex-military, green beret in Korea. He’s that odd contradiction you see in some military people, in which they’ve traveled a lot, yet have not been broadened by it. Because every time they saw a foreign population, they were trying to kill each other. (He’s fought “a lotta them little brown people in KO-RE-a.) So he’s had her watching fox since before trump was elected. It’s all they watch. Now she says the blacks are laughing &amp; singing in the verizon store, the Koreans are buying up all the land around Atlanta, that you can’t even drive on the highways around Atlanta because you’ll be carjacked by “big black men with guns, &amp; antifa.” (She said she saw a picture of a young man on tv &amp; he was wearing a shirt that said antifa &amp; so that’s how she knows it’s real.) She says there is a mosque somewhere out in the woods where she lives, &amp; there’s no road going to it. She says the local town has these middle eastern looking men who are so rude to women &amp; she’s heard they keep their people in compounds &amp; they run the new commercial hog farm &amp; are dumping everything into the creek &amp; now the creek is dead. I lamented sadly about all the tent cities popping up here in Seattle. She said they have some around there in the nearby city, &amp; “those people are just lazy. They just don’t want to work. Just looking for a handout.” I mean she’s saying this about people living on parking berms, in the winter, in tents. Oh, almost forgot - the Mexicans are taking all the carpentry jobs in north Alabama. 

Did I leave anyone out? Black, antifa, anyone remotely Asian, all middle eastern, Mexican, homeless people. 

There are more than a few routes into this “caramel corn in my head” condition. In her case, she doesn’t partake of Qanon. She is not nimble on the computer, &amp; she’s in a rural area, so the connection sucks, because it’s a monopoly out there. So she’s not learning anything q-ish online. And of course fox isn’t going to say anything bad about them, if they say anything at all.

She LOVES nature, which the GOP hates. I might have predicted that she’d hear about Trump removing protections somewhere, &amp; that would make her a one issue voter. Yea...nope. 

And I don’t think she thinks Trump is the messiah, or the best president, or any of that. 

It seems to be that she just hates democrats. Which is interesting. Fox &amp; their ilk don’t need to sell any one idea hard enough to make people buy it. It’s enough to have a low murmur of ear fluff, as long as it’s unceasing. My impression is my mother doesn’t have even one strong opinion on any position or topic. She’s just been spending every evening listening to her husband yell in agreement with fox, which is just about at the point of declaring Democrats have cooties. 

So...that’s it. She hates the democrats. She probably knows about 3 democrats personally, she’s related to all three, so what are you gonna do? So aaaaaaaaaaaaall the rest of the hated democrats are people she’ll never met, never talk to, nothing. And she’ll give up her only child &amp; grandchild for that. People after the election “oh, we shouldln’t be harsh, we need to reach across the aisle.” Are you kidding me? This is my OWN MOTHER &amp; she might as well be living on Mars. It just breaks my heart. For both of us. She seems miserable. But she’s where she wants to be. The people encouraging these beliefs have that cult rule of -if anyone is asking questions, it’s because they are the enemy &amp; they are trying to keep you from believing THE TRUTH. I reach out to her, but before we even make contact she’d skittered away, hissing &amp; spitting. 

As to the vaccine, here comes another example of how one can pick &amp; choose from the conspiracies like a brain fat buffet. She DOES believe in COVID, as well as vaccines. She &amp; he are old. I suspect your willingness to forego medical care just to show you’re not a sheeple can by highly correlated with your age. I know they wear masks, &amp; isolate. And, boy, out there in the country, that isolation stuff is real. Her husband got his first shot in December, I think; at the VA because he’s a vet. She, 80, was unable to find a vaccine. 

About 2 weeks before the inauguration, we had the following discussion. She said, “remember I said Bob got his first shot?” “Yea,” I said, “when does he get is 2nd?” Her voice gets hard. “He’s not. Biden said they have to give out all the vaccines now, so there won’t be any 2nd vaccines. He tried to get a shot at the hospital. They said they didn’t have any because Biden made them give them all out. And that they weren’t allowed to give them any of what they had.” (They have them &amp; also they don’t have them??) I was exasperated. “Listen, I’m sure Biden &amp; Harris will do the best with... (the hot mess they’ve been left with, I’m thinking...) what they have,” I finish. “Biden &amp; Harris ARE the problem!” She shrieked. Then hung up. She does a lot of hanging up. 

Shortly after, I sent a newsy letter. Had to insert a line saying Biden hadn’t been inaugurated yet, so he had literally no power over any of their vaccine experiences. 

She said she couldn’t find a place to get the shot. I went online &amp; used the PA heat map to find a spot over the mountains, about an hour away. She called &amp; told me they told her to try back in 6 months. Hmmmmm do I have doubts? Maybe so, maybe so. That evening I call &amp; say I found 8 places in one town, also about an hour away. The next day I call &amp; she says none of them have anything (which is the opposite of what the state vaccine map says). I offer to keep looking. She starts ranting that it’s all political, that the whole world is political. And I thought, she’s not going to get a vaccine. It’s not because she believes they implant chips, it’s not because god will heal everything, it’s not because it would prove Covid is real. One reason: Biden prevented the shots when Trump was still in office. If she gets a shot now, now that Trump is OUT of office, it means Biden did something right, or at least will get the credit (in her fevered brain) because he’s president when she gets her shot. On a related &amp; highly infuriating side note, they do have the vaccine in the small town 10 min down the road. But the state line is between her &amp; there. It’s 5 miles from her house. She can’t go there, she has to go over the mountains, an 80yo at the wheel. 

Do you see the level of crazy here? She would rather skip a potentially lifesaving vaccine, which she fully believes in, just to own the libs. “Biden can’t do anything right.” *cough*

If she had cancer, or just dropped down dead, there would be a marker for me. A thing to say, “Here, start mourning NOW. Go find a book about losing someone to cancer. Join an online support group for sudden death.” We have maps for these things. For me, every phone call puts me in mourning. I don’t know where this is going. There is no medicine she can take for this, to make her regain her health. It’s just sad.

I hope I can get back to everyone who has responded but if I don't, know your support has been super appreciated. 

I'm making my first post here because I'm so sick and sad I don't know what to do. My mom was always my best friend, the person I went to for everything under the sun. She's always been a republican, and I went from being her good republican daughter to a total democrat (I'm in my 30s now), but even then we still had a great relationship as long as we avoided political discussions. Now everything is different.

I don't know if she's into Q specifically, but she is deep in the conspiracies that I believe Q is rooted in. Every once in while over the past decade (at least) she'd bring up something about the New World Order and other associated stuff. I never took it seriously and shut it down. It seemed about as harmful as talking about alien abductions and area 51. (Now seeing advice on how to deal with loved ones in a cult, I feel like I handled everything wrong and it is so hard to not blame myself for dismissing her and for the times our political conversations actually devolved into yelling matches.)

But now with the pandemic, she has gone off the rails. Gradually she got sucked into this mindset that Covid is fake. Or it's not fake and it was created in a lab. The number of deaths is inflated. Doctors are refusing to treat patients with actual life savings drugs (hydroxychloroquine, etc). The vaccines are unsafe. And because of her beliefs, she continues to live her life like nothing is happening.

[This is where a lot of the post got really specific so please forgive me for deciding to remove it.]

I guess maybe this is only loosely related to this sub, being that she has very Q beliefs about the virus. There are other things too, like how all of the main stream news is fake and the election was stolen. The thing is, she always disliked Trump... up until the election. I have been to afraid to ask her specifically about Q, but like I said, she's been into the OG conspiracy stuff for years so it seems likely. She sees everything happening now as proving all of her theories right, that this has all been planned for the last 50 years.

I'm sorry this is so long. I've spent a lot of time yesterday and today crying and talking to my fiance and trying to wrap my head around what's happening, I think it's time I have a wider support group.

Guy who introduced us has COVID19. No vaccine, not because he wouldn't, just didn't get to our age bracket yet where he lives.

Other guy wears an expensive Sig Sauer on his hip, has been ranting about the ""ChiCon virus"" for the last year. He's owed me a package for several months, can't raise him. We're the same height, he's got about seventy pounds on me. I'm starting to get a bad feeling here.

You have a long run of good luck, then a similar amount of bad luck, this is where you end up - last one standing from your crew.

dad is a member of the Qult. He was always very narcissistic growing up, a dictator in his own home.  He beat me for everything from bad grades to back talking.

I have a few good memories with him, but most of my memories revolve around walking on eggshells because I was scared of him.  When I was a teen, he let me read his journal (which, looking back, was more of a manifesto) and one of the things he wrote in it was that he believed that all addicts should be forced to consume every bit of drugs found on them if and when arrested, whether it kills them or not.  Thats the kind of person he is.  He has no empathy.  

I wound up addicted to meth at one point. (Thank god ive been clean for quite a few years now, no thanks to him.)  He still believes these things knowing that I used to be an addict.

Now on to the meat of the story.

I havent had a relationship with him for years, but somehow we bonded over NASCAR recently.  I started playing iracing and he asked me to make youtube videos so that he could watch me race.  We started watching NASCAR together (from opposite ends of the country) this year.

During this whole time he has been saying nasty things about liberals, using the word ""lib #%$@"" ect.  But even though im a liberal, I just ignore it because I want to have this relationship with him.  I havent told him I'm a liberal, I just ignore his rants or change the subject.

The other day I told him I really liked Bubba Wallace (he is a black nascar driver and advocate of black lives matter)  and my dad said he wasnt thrilled with him BECAUSE of black lives matter.  

He spouted that nonsense about ALL lives mattered the same, and I figured it was safe to teach him that its not about black people thinking they were better, it was about cops treating them as if they were inferior.  

""Its not black lives matter MORE, its black lives matter TOO""

His response was that they should change the slogan to be less confusing.  I dropped it then, but I should have told him that its NOT confusing except to the people that were the problem.

The other day we were talking about how the NASCAR championship works and he made a comment ""Nascar must be run by liberals, they make everything so hard""

I figured this was pretty tame, so I said ""I guess this is a good time to tell you that I'm a liberal""

I guess I figured that if he knew, hed ease up on the hurtful remarks.  This wasnt really the case though, because the next words out of his mouth were probably the most hurtful things he's ever said to me.

""I know and I'm trying very hard not to hold it against you""

All I replied was ""me too, so lets not talk politics at all""  and he POUNCED on that idea and made it his own.  

""Yeah we can either fight or we can talk racing, but we cant do both, I vote racing""

This was a week ago, and I have to give him this, he hasnt made any more comments.

I keep going back to that ""I know, and I'm trying hard not to hold it against you.""  This bothers me and is eating me up on so many levels.

First of all, how dare he? I can understand thinking those thoughts, because I feel the same way about him... But how dare he voice them to me like that?  Making me feel like its a chore to love me?  I mean I DID say ""me too"" to him, but that was a reflex.  He hurt me and I lashed out.  Very tamely I might add.

Secondly, and heres where it gets worse....

If he knew, then he was making all thise comments KNOWING it was hurtful to me.

If he didn't know, then he was lying to me.  Which is some REAL bullshit because he used to beat me when he caught me in a lie, and then beat me again over whatever I lied about.

I think that it might be in my best interest to just drop him completely, but for some reason I really dont want to.  Its so hard to just let go.  I dont know what to do here.

Sorry for the rant, I know this isnt r/relationship_advice but I needed somewhere to vent.

Thanks for listening.


Edit:  thank you all so much for the support.  I promise that I have read and upvoted every single reply, and will continue to do so, even if I dont respond.  I feel a whole lot better about the situation now.

Love to all

Edit 2:  thank you for the awards, but I have to say that I find it extremely humorous someone gave me the wholesome award lol.  I mean I get it, it was what you had and I appreciate the sentiment, but it made me belly laugh at the absurdity of it.

Now she doesn't just read and watch videos, she considers herself an Anon. She actively communicates with QAnon members, something she denied before. She's back to advocating a violent revolution, if needed, though she says she would not partake. She  made herself late for work trying to convince me that 10% of people in the world now believe as she does, and that more are ""waking up"" every day.   


I'm heartbroken again, and not sure how much longer I can persevere in trying to save her. Trying to save us.  I have reading I need to do for Dr. Hassan, but I can't even motivate myself to do that.

My mother, grandfather and many friends and acquaintances have all been, for lack of a better word, possessed by this conspiracy mind virus that has been going on. I'm not from the US, but i find many similar elements of the QAnon conspiracy spreading even here.

""Bill Gates and the satanic elite have created the coronavirus as an excuse to chip us all so that we can be mind controlled  by the 5G network! Oh and they're all blood drinking pedophiles hell-bent on putting placentas and aborted foetuses into LITERALLY EVERYTHING""

This is only a slight exaggeration, but only a slight one, as anyone who has spent an extended amount of time speaking to these people can attest.

That isn't to say that every conspiracy theory is necessarily false, just look at MK Ultra. Though there's a slight leap i believe between ""the government is doing shady shit and ""there's a cabal of satanists trying to murder the planet, who may or may not be lizard people (read: jews)""

Trying to shoot down the many.. many obviously false and ludicrous claims has drained a lot of my energy, and quite frankly a good chunk of my sanity too. Why? Well, here's an example:

Early on in the pandemic there were images and stories floating around of a green canister with ""COVID-19"" photoshopped on it. If i remember correctly the image itself was older than the pandemic by quite a lot, besides the fact that it was painfully obvious that the text was added digitally. 
Well, not obvious enough apparently as it spread through social media of many different countries.

Or how about that ""5G tower motherboard with COVID19 printed on it"", that was actually taken from an old VCR? Like you could look it up by a code printed on the board and see where it came from.

This wasn't just random misinterpretation of information that just became viral, this was purposeful disinformation put out there to feed into this growing lunacy. Why? Is it 4chan just pulling shit to mess with people to get a laugh? It's either that, or there's a conspiracy to spread conspiracies around to put the masses into panic mode so that no one gets vaccinated and we all DIE or the global economic system collapses and the lizard people can finally take over the world and drink baby blood out of capri sun packages!

You see what this shit is doing to me? I'm not actually serious about the second part of what i wrote but goddamn does the madness spread. And there's nothing you can do about it.
It has become like a religion, and your belief in the conspiracy is the only way you can reach salvation and therefore those caught in this madness believe it's their moral duty to convince you that it's true so that you don't get microchipped by Microsoft!

Who the fuck keeps spreading these lies? Why?! AAAAAGH!

I also feel like I owe this sub for helping me come to an important realization: my Qmother is a covert narcissist. A few commenters pointed out that it sounded like my Qmother might have NPD and it kept gnawing at me. I've spent *years* struggling to make sense of my Qmother and it hurt that I couldn't. For a while I suspected she was a covert narcissist, but something just clicked when I looked deeper into the matter. Suddenly, everything made sense and I feel so relieved!

Hey all, new here. My mom has really been into QAnon ever since it got started and all I hear about these days is her talking about all of the messed up theories and I haven't been able to have a ""normal"" conversation with her since the pandemic started. She has always been very far right and it just got worse in the months leading up to Trump's inauguration in 2016, but this is a new level of messed up stuff.

 Background info:  At first, when the 2016 presidential campaigns started, she supported Ted Cruz and she didn't support Trump until my grandparents told her that they supported him, showing all of these (in my opinion) stupid reasons and overall showing that they didn't really respect minorities and LGBT+ people. I came out as a lesbian when I was 13 (so, almost 7 years ago as I'm almost 20 now) and I knew that they didn't really support me from how they reacted (mom tried to say that I didn't know what I was feeling/talking about, grandparents threatened my parents to essentially lock me away in my room and take away my phone). So, when the 2016 election came about, my grandparents and my mom were actively and openly supporting Trump. That felt like a huge blow to me because of me being LGBT+. But, that's not the end of that. All of them are transphobic and I realized that I was genderqueer/fluid within the past year and I told that to my parents. My mom reacted super badly and my dad didn't say much and it was overall an awful experience. I've never told my grandparents about it, knowing how they reacted to me coming out as gay because they're more transphobic than homophobic. So, I didn't feel safe to tell them. My dad isn't in this equation much because he has always been afraid of telling my mom what he thinks about things and he's a pretty quiet guy, versus my mom being a very loud person. He's very much a guy that gets walked all over when it comes to her and he has some bad mental health issues. I, also, suffer with a bunch of mental health problems, including MDD, C-PTSD, possibly AvPD (still going to therapy to see if I do have that, but I show pretty much every single symptom), severe anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and a bunch of other things. So, I've been pretty much labeled as a sick person who doesn't know themself and is just crazy. My dad, on the other hand, is kinda a pushover.

How it started: Before quarantine, when all of the COVID stuff was new on the news, my mom and grandparents took it seriously and took the needed precautions for things. But then, my mom doing info research on COVID stuff, she came across QAnon stuff and that's when things started going downhill. She became obsessed with the things those people were talking about and taking them as fact. At first I was like, oh this isn't too serious and just some more bs she hears from far right people. But, oh my god I was so wrong. 

How it's going: She got more and more into QAnon and to the point where she wouldn't talk to me or my dad because she'd be watching another video of that stuff. Anytime I would address it and how it was complete bs, she would say that I've been brainwashed and that I need to listen to her because she's right. Then, anytime I tried to challenge the things she has ""learned"" from her QAnon videos, she'd get really angry, start saying that no one takes her seriously, and that we think that she's stupid. It got to the point where she was victimizing herself. I talked to my therapist about it and my sister (who has been moved out since 2017 and isn't into QAnon and is very much the opposite of my mom and grandparents) and they both suggested that I should ask her to not talk about politics and the like around me. So, I asked her and she essentially said that that's ""part of her personality and that she's trying to save people from the bad people in the world"". I still tried to let her know how it made me feel (anxious, on edge, scared, etc.), but she didn't listen. She keeps talking about the QAnon stuff and idk what to do anymore. It just sucks so much because she essentially supports people who are against people like me (LGBT+) and even my dad (he's mixed, half Asian/a PoC). It's like a blow to the heart anytime she talks about it and I can't move out yet because I've been working on my mental health issues (which have been really bad), so I haven't been able to work to get the money to leave. I spend so many nights crying because I feel like I don't know my mom or grandparents anymore and I keep asking myself why and how did this happen. I've been trying to educate my mom about the LGBT+ community and trying to talk to her about the struggles PoC go through (that white privilege is real), but she never listened.

It feels like a lot of the time, I failed in educating her about those groups of people who have more difficult lives than she does just based off of their race or sexual/gender identity because QAnon is very much not supportive of BLM and couldn't care less about LGBT+ people and what they/us go through. I've tried playing devil's advocate for the opposing side of what she believes, but it doesn't make a difference. Things still stay the same. She has turned into this cold hearted, distant person and it doesn't even feel like I have a mother anymore. She goes to a bunch of Trump rallies, protests, and is an anti-masker. I don't even know what she's doing day by day because she doesn't tell me and I wake up nearly every day to her being gone. She would tell my dad in passing as she's going out to where she was going and what she was doing, but she wouldn't tell any of us ahead of time. I hardly ever really see her anymore and I just feel a profound sense of loss from how far gone she is into QAnon. It's like the empathy for other people has been sucked out of her and replaced by a QAnon programmed robot. She used to be such a nice woman that would listen to other people's thoughts, feelings, and opinions and would put herself in their shoes. Now, all I have to compensate for that is a whole closet full of food and stuff that she's hoarding when (in her words) ""shit goes down"" and the QAnon stuff goes into effect. Idk what to do and I struggle with seeing how that stuff makes sense at all. A lot of it feels like a stretch and a lot of it doesn't add up to me. She praises Trump like he's Jesus himself and I don't understand how someone can support someone like him. I'm a very empathetic person, to a fault, but I'm struggling to make sense of it all. At the same time, none of it makes sense. It feels like I'm going crazy and I'm glad that I was able to find this community because it has been such a lonely and anxiety inducing situation. It has effected my sleep profoundly (I've had bad insomnia from it and I'm on sleep meds, so it's been THAT bad) and I'm just lost.

I want to say that I believe from watching my mother that most of her belief in this kind of ideas comes from her strong rejection of authority, she was raised only by my grandmother, we all love grandma but she has always been very distrustful of anyone trying to ""control"" her, she had some bad experiences with our grandfather and multiple people on her life that left her wanting to be alone and trying to be the only variable that controls her life (and god too), she sees with disgust and distrust people like politicians, cops, rich people, etc anyone that is in a position of more power than her.

My mother is aware of that behavior from my grandmother but she can not see that she carried some of that herself, maybe not in the same way but she has the belief that it's important to protect her individuality from being restricted if my grandmother would refuse to call the police because she doesn't trust men coming to her house even if they could do, god knows what to her daughter, my mother would not be as irrational but would do things like changing her path if police are on sight, even though she is not doing anything wrong, try to go through closed roads even though they are marked as dangerous as not to fall prey in her mind to some sort of sheep mentality, doesn't believe in the Christian God because our grandmother ( which is valid but we can see the resentment towards grandma and she trying to force her religion ).

This even if subtle translates to a lot of things in my mother's life, we all know she does this and nobody looks at it as something dangerous, heck compared to what our grandmother does is nothing. That was before she started watching conspiracy theories with my father.

My father and the rest of the family began to watch this kind of stuff on cable and on the internet and quickly lost interest in the thing but my mother kept on watching it on her phone in her free time, she would comment us this and that and we would just take it as a simple conversation. Now we have begun to worry about her, she refuses to wear a mask, we had to vaccinate our little brother behind her back as not to annoy her. Se didn't go to vote because she said the elections are meaningless now but the thing that worried us the most is that she managed to find people with similar ideas to her and began to go to a club to talk about these conspiracies and they almost went to that rally to ""stop Biden"".

I feel lucky that is not something as severe as it could be, but since we realize the danger that these things can make, I have taken to myself to help her.

But I don't know if is possible for me to help her, every time we try to speak with her she gets defensive and it always goes back and forth into the same thing, she feels she is liberating herself in some way shape, or form and that she can not place her trust on other people and she is constantly looking for some sort of impossible independence from everything.

I didn't know it was a sentiment that came from conspiracies, she has this idea of some utopia without the influence of the massive media (except for the ""alternative media""), without technology (except her phone) with free spirituality (these cheap ""new era"" **enlighten** that these groups tend to sell).  We used to joke with her that that's what grandfather used to have when he was a farmer and he still passed away from drinking his troubles away.

We feel she disconnects more and more from reality and we want to stop it now that is early. any comments would help.

to protect my identity)**  


I would like to offer you good people an additional angle when talking to Q believers that I haven’t seen here so far.

I will describe the thinking-process that led to my rejection of Qanon and then some pointers that may help inducing this process in others.  

**My process**  



After descending deeper and deeper into everything Q, I was suffering a psychotic breakdown. I realized I could no longer discern truth from fiction and fell into a deep depression for two weeks. As an unintended side-effect, I went through a digital detox.

And here is the epiphany that got me back into real-life: 

There are two possibilities: Either Q is right or Q is wrong. It would have to be one or the other. If Q is wrong, then there is no need for me to busy myself with it. If, however Q is right, then…what? Why would I need to follow every new piece of information being dropped? If it is all true, then all should be revealed soon, for everyone to see. In that case, there is also no need for me to busy myself with it.

This realisation might seem unsatisfying at first, but it taught me an almost spiritual lesson: 

There are things in this world that I do not know and cannot know for sure. And that is ok.

I was lucky to come to that realisation by my own, but not everyone will. So here are some angles that might help move someone else there.  


**Digital Detox**  


Information addiction is a real thing. Small bits of information that are just interesting enough but don’t challenge our short attention spans. Twitter et al. know this, news-channels know this, and so do conspiracy boards. So try to convince the person to do this. Hell, make it a challenge and join in yourself (this is beneficial for everyone).  


**Be humble and avoid authority arguments**  


Authority arguments (i.e. referring to scientists or whatever news outlet you deem reputable) cannot work because central part of Qanon is the untrustworthiness of those institutions. And be honest, your trust in those institutions is just that – trust (however legitimate it might be). Instead, be humble and go for the angle I described in my epiphany.  


**Don’t equate conservatism with Q**  


While reading some posts in this sub I got the impression that most users here hold left-leaning views, which is of course legitimate. I held conservative views before I got into Q and I still do. If questioning Q would have meant questioning my whole political identity, I doubt I would’ve gotten out. This is a mental health issue, not a political one.  

**EDIT 1**  

Please don't derail this into a discussion about politics. I am aware that the vast majority if not all Q believers hold conservative views. My point is that it is easier to give up Q if that doesn't mean you have to give up long held political views.

**EDIT 2**  

I should have mentioned I am from Germany. We have a sizeable Q movement here. Please stop asking me about my opinions on US politics.

**EDIT 3**  

There's a lot of questions about the state of Q in Germany coming in, so here is an article in [english](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/world/europe/qanon-is-thriving-in-germany-the-extreme-right-is-delighted.html) and one in [german](https://www.swr.de/swr2/leben-und-gesellschaft/qanon-wie-die-verbreitung-in-deutschland-funktioniert-100.html). Personally, I did not use german channels at all but american ones. I got in and out before it really got big here.

Up until last year, my mom (F 40’s) identified as a democrat. When quarantine happened, she was terrified of our family getting getting the virus. She never left the house unless it was to get groceries, stocked up on hand sanitizer/hand wipes, always wore plastic gloves, and bought an unnecessary amount of (non-disposable) masks. Around this time, she started spending a lot of her free time on her phone. I didn’t know what she was doing until a while later.

One day, I got a Twitter notification that someone on my contact list just made an account. When I saw it was my mom, I checked her account out of curiosity. What I saw was worrying.

At first, it was mostly tweets about spirituality. Then it slowly turned into retweets from QAnon accounts, mostly about #savethechildren and how vaccines cause autism (for context, my younger brother and I are on the spectrum. My mom has always been a little weary of vaccines since my brother got diagnosed ). She never talked about this stuff in person so I didn’t bring it up to her.

Now it’s all she talks about. She talks about how celebrities like John Legend and Tom Hanks are Satanic baby-eating pedophiles, while she worships the ground Donald Trump walks on. For months, she’s been telling my dad and I that things are going to change, that all these celebrities are getting killed, arrested, resurrected (I am not kidding about this one) whether we decide to “keep drinking the kool-aid”. 

Two months ago her Twitter account got suspended. I thought this would help her in some way but it didn’t. Instead, this obsession of trying to prove everyone who was “against her” wrong got worse.

I am really worried about her. She had always struggled with her mental health for as long as I can remember but for the most part she was alright mentally and emotionally. That was until all of this started. She went through periods of not taking her medication, making her go through terrible withdrawals. She would snap at me if I didn’t “agree” with her, called me a sheep, that one day she’ll prove me wrong, and more.

My mom drove me as do not have a car at the moment. Initially the nurses thought my mom, 67, was going to get the vaccine as she is the older one. My mom told the nurses she refuses to get it. She is a prime candidate and has asthma. She watched me get it and asked the nurse “Does the syringe have a microchip?” The nurse tells her no. I felt really embarrassed.

I told her later that I thought it was a stupid question. But she said she had read it on the internet. “They said the syringe would have a microchip.” I tried to do an exercise with her... Tried to make her think about what she was saying. 

“Who is they?”
 “From an article I read.” “Where is the article from.” “I don’t remember, it was on the internet.”

 “Well Moderna never said they would put chips in the vaccine, so whoever they is is wrong.”

“I didn’t say there would be microchips in the vaccine, I said in the syringe!”

“Why would they put a microchip in a syringe?”

“So they can track people!”

“But why would they want to track people?”

“So they can keep a record of how many people are using the vaccine and how they are doing.”

  “You sign paperwork when you are vaccinated which would log your vaccination, and clinical trials are done to see effects before vaccines are pushed to market. You have an iPhone, if someone wanted to track you they can just use your phone.”

“The clinical trials... they don’t know what happens in clinical trials .”

She ignores all the other points I made. She pulls up on her phone a product being sold online called a Microchip Injector. “See, I told you they have them.”

“What does that have to do with the Moderna vaccine?”

“They said that they *could* have them in syringes.”

“Who is they? Its not the government, or Moderna, that said that, so who?”

“An article I read on Facebook.”

“So you got your news from Facebook?”

“No I don’t get my news from Facebook! But they said...”

And back and forth like this, where my Mom never questions her sources, or the absurdity of the conspiracy when taken to the logical conclusions.

My mom has slowly sunk into this hole where all she does is watch YouTube videos and sink into conspiracy theories. Some of them are Q lite stuff,  where she is spouting anti-Semitic stuff despite never having said anti-Semitic stuff in life before.

For context, I spent my junior/high school years living in the South in a three-generation family.  My grandfather got involved in a group that was at the time the religious arm of the alt-right.  Soon it encompassed our whole life - homeschooling because schools were indoctrination centers, new ""church"" because you can't believe what traditional preachers say, only ""natural medicine"" because ""doctors don't know anything and vaccines are poison""..... basically distrust of anyone not in our group. Violently racist because ""even the poorest white man is better than any \[insert slur here\]"".  

Additionally, they were heavily armed and believed the government would come at any time and take them to prison or kill them. When I was 16, my grandfather very carefully explained how, if the FBI came to the house and he was killed in the shoot-out, I was to bury him in the back 40 so no one would know he was dead and my grandmother could continue to collect his Social Security.  Funny thing is, the FBI did show up at their house once, but that's a whole 'nothing story.

So when I listen to what QAnon is preaching and how it takes over a person's life, I recognize it for the cult it is, and know how hard it is to leave.  The person would have to admit they were lied to, and then give up most of their social/online life.  What do you do when nearly everyone you know is in the same cult, especially when most of your human contact is online since one of the hallmarks of QAnon is throwing away any person who isn't a believer?

I see a lot of people playing the aggrieved victim-blamer card, over and over. In fact, it is captured well in this article about the QAnon Shaman who now abdicates all personal responsibility for his actions in the Capitol riots and blames Trump for ""grooming"" him ([https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-shaman-whines-that-trump-groomed-him-and-millions-of-other-americans](https://www.thedailybeast.com/qanon-shaman-whines-that-trump-groomed-him-and-millions-of-other-americans)).

I also notice other people who, aside from their victim-blamer mentality, also feel a deep sense of entitlement for things that they have not worked to earn. For example, they didn't go to college and have no skills but they slam academics and think they should be earning as much as, say, the IT person with a masters and relevant marketable skills. 

Loneliness and a deep desire to ""belong."" I suppose after years of living a ground hog day existence, QAnon offered them a ticket out of the tedium and boredom of daily living.

They believe all he bad juju before the election happened and my miscarriage and the arguing within family was the transition toward a higher consciousness.

I thought my brother at least would be reasonable. He was a Q'r as well but he went from at the beginning of the summer to ""Idk what adrenochrome is"" while following Q since early 2020 to full on Trumper/Q/anti-covid and all the associated conspiracies.  After Biden got in, he now thinks we're going to be invaded by China/UN here in Canada to take over the States. 

I live literally right next to my parents and my brother and we were all supposed to be our bubble. But I can't escape any conversations about this shit despite me desperately stating that I don't want to talk about it, walk away, and expressly stating that this is my boundary.

In our most recent discussions, ""real"" seems to center around his firm belief that Q is some kind of divine being with knowledge of the future.

Most of the people in his life have distanced themselves from his ever increasing crazy, but I have been reluctant to do so myself.  I think I might be literally the last sane person that will engage in conversation with him, and I feel a kind of moral responsibility to do so.  I try to be respectful, and I know he appreciates it, even though he tells me that the dems (such as myself) are going to be rounded up and slaughtered in the near future...

He talks about these mountains of evidence (""bread"") showing that ""the plan is real,"" and I have been getting him to show me, which he is all to happy to do. 

Here is one of many images he's sent to me that he calls ""bread""

He went to a good college, works a nice IT job, by all outside rating factors, he would seem to have it together.... but he's also a full blown Q adherent at this point.

I think it's time for me to join the others in his life that have abandoned him, for my own sanity.  Today we argued for an hour on discord about whether or not the image he emailed me qualified as proof... he thinks it does. 

Really, he thinks that this qualifies as proof that Q is real.... wtf?

He tried to argue that the windmills caused the Texas black out, and when my dad and I said “clearly they didn’t, there’s windmills in Canada dude” he just wouldn’t change his mind. He’s like that a lot. He’ll say something boldly wrong, we’ll counter his points, and he’ll just stumble over his words and say “well I see what you mean” and then leave the room. 

The most frustrating thing right now is him with COVID. 

For backstory, my dad is 63. He has lung issues, heart issues, is overweight, and is just generally very high risk. He’s the only parent we have, and my best friend. 

My dipshit brother now goes off about how “masks don’t work because counties without mask mandates have the lowest cases” and that Fauci is lying or not to be trusted,  and he keeps on saying how the vaccines were made “too fast” (it would be a valid fear if I didn’t know he only thought that cause of false information). 

He’s constantly eating out at restaurants and going to public places to hang out despite us asking him not to. He works at a Valet place and I think it’s great that he’s working to support us and he always wears a mask there, but I just wish he’d stay home after. 

The most infuriating thing was yesterday when he started talking about how COVID wasn’t really a risk anymore cause numbers are going down, and he’s “been going out all the time and hasn’t gotten it yet.” When my dad said that it’s likely cause he was wearing a mask he just said “well I clearly don’t wear them at restaurants lol.” 

He then said “well we’re all going to get it anyways” which made me want to cry because my dad is likely to fucking die if he gets it and my brother just doesn’t care. My dad and I are both clearly upset by it but my dad is really sweet and just keeps saying that he can’t control my brothers opinions. 

He’s welcome to have his stupid opinions, but when he’s putting us all at risk that’s when the line should be drawn. Be mad all you want, but just put your mask on and wash your hands and stop being a giant baby. 

He also wants to be a cop and I’m fucking terrified. I just know he’s the type of man to abuse his power. I’m already scared of him most of the time. Any disagreement can turn into a heated argument and it hurts my dad whenever we fight, so I just leave the room or be silent whenever he’s around. He’s borderline abusive to his girlfriend (I’m not around the two of them enough to know the full story, but she’s complained to me before about him giving her the “silent treatment” and similar things). We were both abused by our mom as a kid and I know this plays into it but he refuses to get help (he thinks mental illness is fake and psychiatry is a scam.). 

He’s also just fucking racist. Coming home from work talking about the “loud/obnoxious black people” he had to deal with, or the “immigrants that could barely speak English”. 

There’s nothing I can do and I’ve just accepted that I won’t have a relationship with him once he moves out, but it’s sucks. I’m an awful sibling too and I know he has reason to dislike me, I just wish it was left with personal disputes and not political bullshit that drives us apart.

I am a high schooler just trying to have someone hear my cry for help.

Everyone in my house has different political ideas. My mom is a former republican who’s now a right leaning centrist. My dad is a liberal, and my grandma is almost out of her “this post on Facebook said..” phase (marvelous process made by her though!! She currently is waiting to get her second dose of the vaccine)

My mom has constantly denounced conspiracy theories, spoke out against Trump many times. This has caused her to loose friendships, have people stop talking to her, and one even said “people in leadership roles shouldn’t be political” which led my mom to resigning from her job at a church. This church also has a far-right nationalist pastor who believes we aren’t going to be able to worship soon (because a catholic is going to take away Christians rights. Yeah, ok) I’ve hear people at that church say that BLM protesters deserve to get covid, covid deaths are fake, nobody has died, and all you can imagine. Now onto my family...

My extended family on my mother’s side is a different story. Most are very anti-government conspiracy theorist. I went to eat breakfast with my cousins about 2 weeks ago and what I heard made me want to cry. Two of my cousins said that Covid was planned by the Government (because all 195 countries decided it was a good idea to release a deadly disease that’s killed over millions? Okay...) and they truly believe in Pizza gate, 9/11 was planned, and that all Democrat ran cities are hell on earth. My great uncle even posted an article at the church I (formerly) went to saying our Mayor is a liberal and she wants to take our guns. Many of them don’t want to take the vaccine (because they believe a Facebook troll over scientists who’ve been doing their jobs for 20+ years) they listen to OANN, Fox, any new source that worships Trump as their savior. 

I also talked about how the world thinks we are insane (very understandable) after they saw the terrorist attack on the capitol. My cousin said “well they also saw BLM and antifa...” and it hit me. The capitol invasion is what they’ve wanted. All the clues have added up, saying they were going to buy AR-15s because “In Joe Biden’s America they’ll be taken away” Ever since then it’s been a constant struggle with them.
 
My dads parents are also going down the rabbit hole, they watch OANN, Fox, they think CNN is the devils way of speaking to America. My grandfather thought it was unfair because it wasn’t his age groups turn to get the vaccine (patience grandpa, patience) and it’s become very clear they can’t snap out of it.

I’ve always been told family first, and usually these things have never affected me in any bad way, I would just say “whatever” and go on. But after those past year watching our politics go in a wacky direction, I can’t look past my family and family friends believing these things.

I found a lady who had a tiny house built, and she decorated it so cutely.  She even had cute outbuildings done in the same manner.  Her holiday and seasonal decorating was adorable.  Those pics were so lovely.

Then she started posting a lot of stuff praising god and being anti-vax for her dogs, blaming vaccines for her beloved dog getting cancer.  I thought, ""OK, she's really hurting right now, and she has no SO or kids, and this is her way of coping,"" so I kept reading.

Then she moved from the PNW to the southeast.  She said that god led her there.  She bought a cute little house and started decorating that too.  But she spike so disparagingly about the west coast where she grew up, and it started seeping into all of her posts, as well as the religious stuff.  She didn't know anyone where she had bought her house, so that must have been very isolating for her.

Then Trump got elected, and things really started changing.  She started decorating alongside Trump signs, and verbally got into it with people who asked her to not be so in-your-face about it.  She changed her bio to be even nastier, telling people who were only there for home decorating to ""move along"", because her blog was a safe space for conservatives.  At this point, none of the home decorating blog posts were Trump or Q free, and for every 1 home decor post there was one about how she praises god for electing Trump and ""saving the country"".  I stopped regularly reading after that.  The last post is from January 3rd, praying that Pence wouldn't certify the election results because ""no one she knows voted for Biden,"" so she is sure the election was stolen.

Now, I didn't know this person personally, but her early posts helped me through a time when I was afraid of being homeless with my kid.  The pictures were so beautiful, and I still look at them from time to time.  But I'm a little sad at how far she has fallen.  She went from an earthy crunchy cool chick to a Qultist.  How many peopke have turned away from her business because of her rants and general disagreeable behavior?  How much more is she isolating herself?

My boyfriend actually was semi-recently committed to a mental hospital because he is OBSESSED with Q.

I really need to end it with my boyfriend because Q is more important to him than I am (we've been together for almost 4 years).  He was normal before, albeit still very into politics, but it was normal. We could have normal conversations and I loved listening to him talk about his interests (he was trying to teach me about stocks before he was committed). Politics never mattered to our relationship, as we believe vastly different things. Towards the end, he couldn't sleep. He was obsessed with the pizzagate thing, and he kept talking to my mom about it. My mom didn't believe it (thank god) but she got him onto that belief that Trump is a time traveler that's come to save us and that the world is flat and all that jazz. I am so mad that she got that into his head, as he was already struggling. That's the part that really pushed him over the edge.

Supposedly he was following people and forcing them to listen to his Q rhetoric as he thought he was saving them. I know for certain he went MIA for a few days and then they found him in the streets, crying and covered in his own feces/vomit. It pains me to think of him like that, as he is normally such a strong person. He (like me) has some serious mental health conditions.

When he was in the hospital and we'd talk nearly everyday over the phone, he seemed normal. He told me he loved me for the first time in months, and I felt like he was getting better. He's been out for a while and he's been weaned off his meds and he's finally starting to feel more like himself again, but now he's on me because masks don't work and the pandemic is a hoax and whatnot.

He hasn't told me he's loved me since, and I am just very, very tired of him loving politics and Q more than he loves me. I want to break up with him, but I don't know how as I've never had to do so before and I still want him in my life because he's normally such a nice, sweet guy.

been with her close to 4 years. I found out she was anti-vax shortly into our relationship. At the time, I didn't think too much into it. I'm one who always believes it's her body, her choice when it comes to what she does to herself.  She has always been a heathy eater and earthy hippie type when it comes to diets, which I though was always a positive thing. About a year into our relationship she was diagnosed with lyme disease. After the diagnosis, she started getting into a bunch of pseudoscience healing, such as muscle testing,  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, rife machine frequency treatment, crystal healing and such. Bought dozens if not hundreds of natural supplements, bouncing around to 6 or 7 different doctors's some of them real, and some natural. Some of the real doctors didn't think she had lyme at all, but that is a discussion for a different day. I always supported her on her decision of treatment. Then covid hit and she started becoming even a little more extreme with her views. She started believing that masks do more harm than good. She believes now that Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci are evil and trying to decrease the population an whatnot. I feel that her facebook antivax groups were her gateway drug to looney tunes land.
 
Now the other night I brought up the fact that it looks like covid cases are going down. She blurted out ""yeah they won their election with this bullcrap, now let us get back to normal"". I was a little shocked. I was like, ""wait a minute, do you really belive that?"". She said, ""yep, covid is fake"". She's always despised trump during his presidency, so we had that in common. Latley, when she hears of someone getting  the vaccine, she goes into rants about how stupid they are for not doing their ""research"". Almost everything is now a conspiracy theory with her. She has even started to believe the government is controlling the weather and the recent cold wave was caused by them. She has become a very negative minded with just about everything lately. Any conversation is quickly flipped to something negative. It's gotten to the point that it's affecting my mental health. I just can't understand how she could become so brainwashed from random people she doesn't know on the internet, and take what they say as fact. She tells me I am the one who is brainwashed.

only person I have in my life right now who doesn't buy into this Q stuff is my SO.  I'm starting to feel like our safety (just from Covid-paranoia and their Anti-Masking ways alone) is in question.  

My mother has used my mental health vulnerability against me before and she attempted to do so again in 2020.  I am just recently learning what a boundary is in my 30's.  Because I set a boundary, she started telling family I was ""losing my mind again.""  I'm literally just chillin, home-schoolin and having anxiety like the majority of the country- I'm not doing anything wrong or different except I am seeing a therapist and setting boundaries.  My weight- which has been the same exact weight for eight years sans the fluctuation from bloating- was suddenly being dragged into question.  If they can claim my disordered eating is flaring up again, then they can claim I'm getting ""crazy"" again.  This is starting to feel like some FreeBritney shit in my own life.  Except lucky me, I'm poor so nobody wants to use me for that lol.  My mother was infuriated I wouldn't open my door for her and then sent every other family member for me.  I had more invitations to outings and unannounced drop-bys by family members in 2020 than all other years of my adulthood combined.  I learned how to say no but I'm still not leveled up enough yet to not include reasons.  I was accused of ""isolating myself"" by every single family member.  In a global pandemic.  When we're supposed to be staying at home.  It's absurd but my sense of humor is drifting away from me, and I have to keep a strong connection to that because that has been a vehicle for my ability to remain calm and stable throughout this past year.  And I tell you what, when you're the ""crazy one"" of your family, watching your whole family Folie a'Deux in front of your eyes over a period of years.... Yeah I've had enough taking stress hormones because of them.  I have to get away from this because it is no joke, wrecking my body.  

I don't know how to do this.  My therapist even seems on the bandwagon as I've heard Antifa come out of his mouth at least thrice over the period of a year.  Apparently I live in a rural pocket of dysfunction and I have to lay low and strategically pull myself out of this situation.  I just need to get to vaccinations without catching the Rona.  I'm no longer worried about changing anyone's minds.  I'm about protecting my immediate family from this craziness.  Just yesterday, my mother was spouting bullshit about how we already caught Rona last year in this time (when I'd attempted my first boundary with her in asking she do not come to our house sick, she did anyway then went on to say we caught it, too.  We did not and we were not sick at all in 2020.) and when I said that immunities only last for 6 months, she called it all bullshit.  My grandmother, who will die a terrible drawn out death if she catches the Rona, is being cared for by my mother.  I have absorbed nothing but fucking Cortisol for the entirety of 2020 because of the fears I have of losing these people and also the fears I have of losing my own life or ability to walk or talk because they can't respect my wishes.  My doctor told me flat out not to catch Rona because I'm already having neuropathy symptoms (which are obvious to see) and we haven't figured out the root causes as to why.  I've explained this to everyone I know.  Mother, siblings, grandparent, uncles/aunts and cousins, too.  One would think that would lead to an understanding.  Of course not.  My life can never be just problem to solution then solved.  No wonder why I have crippling anxiety.  I'd have to be a psychopath to not be freaking out atm.

I'm so exhausted and I reached a breaking point last month where something got shut off in me.  I am no longer willing to help them, I'm no longer open to hearing their sob stories, I'm no longer able to share my life or struggles with them.  The only thing stopping me from changing my number and cutting them off completely are the younglings that are in tow and my urge to be the best influence to them I can muster.  


Please just could someone else- even if you have to lie, tell me I'm not the only one who's losing everyone they knew and loved to Q. 
 I don't think I can handle feeling this alone in the world today. 
 Thank you if you read this all.

Edit- Thank you for all of the support and I will be meeting with my therapist within the week and moving on.  Someone gave me great advice of taking seven different people's input on any one given subject and I love that and will be taking that with me wherever I go.

I am high risk and she is super high risk so getting a vaccine is not just a so I don't feel really bad for a while because I'm in the demographic of people who could likely die from it from what I understand. This has gone from sad to pathetic to outright endangering my life.

I'm only 17 so I can't go and get one by my self yet but I told her in 4 months once I turn 18 I am getting it. Then comes the typical arguments about how ""no your not its not safe"" and ""I'm only doing this to protect you""

The past six months have been a living hell to go through with my mom. She has a lot of bad medical issues she has been a bit or an odd ball but I never thought it would be conspiracy theorist then and anti Vax and every day it seems like their are new even more dangerous than the last things she believes. 

Meanwhile I'm terrified that she is going to have a second cardiac arrest and drop dead, the only reason she survived the first one was because I happen to be in the house in the other room, I even watched her die and be revived by paramedics. So I've got trauma, and paranoia to leave her alone all while having to deal with her loosing her mind more and more every day.

Im sorry for the rant I just really needed a place to vent.

Edit: things just got worse My mom called me into the living room to argue with me about how Bill gates, Anthony Faucci and George Sorrose created the covid virus in order to make money off the vaccine while depopulating the planet.

Bear with me, this is gonna be kind of a rambly post with no real resolution. I just want to share my story.

For as long as I can remember, my dad has bought into conspiracy theories. He's a recovering addict (who doesn't believe in addiction) and he's on narcotics due to a back injury he sustained. His delusions somehow were exacerbated by this injury, he totally changed after it.

It started out kind of small and standard, when I was in elementary school he would warn me about the illuminati and make me watch bizarre youtube videos. That was tolerable, though. He was still a good dad. We would go out rock hunting in the Owyhees, or practice shooting together. On clear nights we'd star gaze and he'd point out constellations and planets, talk about the basic science behind them. It was silly, but at the time these bonding experiences with my father made me believe I could work at NASA. It was a childhood dream of mine.

When I hit 12, I started forming my own opinions, and unfortunately it caused issues. He became distant, but not outlandish. No, it wasn't until a few years later, 2016, that his mental stability seemed to totally collapse.

He started off by becoming a Flat Earther. My friends find it real funny, but it's honestly extremely sad. I'd try to get him to come look at the moon and stars with me and it would end with him screaming in my face about how none of it was real, and I was stupid for even thinking it was. He became a massive Trump supporter, essentially believed he was the messiah, and my father just dissolved into this hateful, bigotted, fearful shell of the man I used to know. 

He started to believe the military was going to storm the house and take his guns, he was constantly on edge about what big secrets the government was hiding, he was just sure Trump would bust that deep state pedo ring, other outlandish and bizarre stuff. He started watching alt-right youtubers and began mimicking their sentiments about the LGBTQ community being evil and unnatural and undeserving of life. I am a closeted transman and I know I can never come out for fear of my own safety. I'm scared of what my dad would do.

We don't rock hunt or star gaze anymore. The closest thing I can get to that is agreeing to help him pick up brass to reload for the impending apocalypse. Other than that, he takes off on his motorcycle for days at a time or just ignores his family. We stay quiet because we're scared of his delusion-filled blowups. Everyday I question how much further he's going to slip away from reality.

I don't really have a point, other than I really, really miss my dad. I hope maybe my story can provide some warning signs for others and help prevent their fathers from falling too far, too.

Honestly, all I want is to be able to stargaze with my dad again.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,138673,public,confidence,self,I Lost My Dad to Conspiracy Theories,1,[],0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lsrkw6/i_lost_my_dad_to_conspiracy_theories/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

QAnon has taken over my mother's life and driven her to the point of being committed to a mental institution twice in less than a month. This has left me as basically the head of household for a house that I don't even live in and am 100+ miles away from. I've had to take in 3 cats, worry about bills being paid on the house and my 3 dogs that were taken to the pound following my mother's committal, plus the well-being and safety of my 14 year old sister who was made to move in with my father following an incident with my mother that made her get committed the first time, all on top of me being a double major in music and political science and taking 20 credit hours this semester. I'm trying my best to keep my head above water, but it's so hard when I don't even recognize my own mother anymore. She's diagnosed with manic bipolar depression, but QAnon has led her to believe that she no longer needs her medicine, causing her to lash out at others, specifically my sister. She's still in the hospital as we speak with no signs of improvement. My mom has been my best friend for so long and I miss her so much. It feels like I've not been able to have a normal conversation with her in over three months now. I just want my old mom back. I can't even watch my Snapchat memories anymore because there are so many videos of her and watching them just makes my heart hurt more. And I feel so terrible for my sister who is caught up in all of this as well. She's starting her freshman year of high school and has to do so completely remotely and from over sixty miles away because she's with my dad, who neither of us have a good relationship with anyway. It feels like I'm in a never-ending cycle of stress. I want to go home to visit my family like an normal college kid, but I can't because there's no one home anymore. I can't discuss this with anyone at school either because this is a pretty left-leaning institution and I feel like I won't be taken seriously if I do try to talk to any of my political science professors and address it as a valid concern.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,138666,public,confidence,self,Going Through Life As a University Student With a QAnon Mother,1,[],0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lsqldx/going_through_life_as_a_university_student_with_a/,some_ads,7,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's tragic to read the posts on here- it is a small comfort to know I'm not the only one who lost a loved one to a conspiracy about blood-drinking, child-trafficking lizard people.

My mother and her partner had been together since 2007- they met serendipitously after my dad passed. It was a pretty happy relationship for a long time; he was a pretty great dude, funny, and did wonders for my mom keeping up with the house and generally keeping her company. They decided to never marry (having both been married once before), but I felt that he really became part of our family, and he really cared for my sister and I. I moved away from my hometown for work, but felt better leaving knowing she had his companionship. It wasn't a seamless relationship, but it seemed to be what they both needed. At least for awhile.

The drifting apart was insidious at first. He spent gradually more and more time with his friends, and more and more time online. My mom's pretty liberal and he *was* apolitical. Rarely voted, stated he didn't give a shit about politics. But I think he spent too many hours with his really sketchy, racist, generally unpleasant friends, and got caught up. He actually tried to hide his Q browsing for awhile from my mom, knowing she would call him out on it, until he started showing her REALLY bizzare ""information"" and ""YouTube Truths"".

The family really imploded during quarantine. I did my best to give my love and support from afar and tried as hard as I could to play peacekeeper. The election was a big flashpoint for their relationship; LOTS of arguments about politics, and his friends even threatened my mom at times in her own home. My mom thought he'd chill the fuck out afterwards, but he just dove deeper and OBSESSED over the election, the ""cabal"", Bill Gates, all sort of ridiculous nonsense.... And he didn't even vote in the election!

A part of me is a little relieved my mom is out of a relationship she had grown really unhappy with- and I think she's safer away from his friends- but it's truly heartbreaking to see her experience this loss (and not be able to travel to at least give her a hug)...

I'm still Facebook friends with him (albeit I'm not on as much these days). He constantly shares garbage misinformation, particularly with respect to the pandemic, vaccines, and severity of coronavirus.. for me, that's the deepest cut. He would rather believe information from randos and memes on facebook than me............ and I'M A GODDAMN MD.

She said she asked them about if the child pedophilia is really as bad as she thinks it is, and they said, “even worse.” She talked to them for 10 minutes, and essentially, I’m so worried the pushed her so much further back into her culty ways and that things are about to get worse. 

I honestly didn’t know how to react to her and just said, “glad you’re happy”, and other general BS like that to avoid arguing, but, truthfully, I’m so scared that she will regress even more and just be more validated over her conversations with them. Pray (to the universe, to whatever you believe in, and not even in a religious way) for me to get through this.

We hadn't spoken in a few months, so I brought up how freaked out I was about the Capitol riot. He downplayed it, and said he had read things online that made him doubt what really happened.

First he said that simple protestors couldn't have broken the ""bulletproof"" glass windows of the Capitol, implying the photos clearly showing protestors breaking windows were fake somehow. 

Quick aside, they are not and never were bulletproof.

The second thing he claimed was that a lot of the rioters photographed in the Capitol doing destructive things had hammer and sickle tattoos. When I told him I highly doubted the far right guys would have Communist tats, he said, ""Well, that's the point. Then they were on the other side."" 

You know, because a whole bunch of Communist agent provocateurs who are trying to frame the right all tattoo their allegiance in easily visible places and forget to cover it up.

I changed the subject after he told me it was just stuff he read and I should look it up myself. Looking it up myself showed me both these insane ideas are being promulgated by the conspiracy theory crowd.

Great people, lots of fun, professionals, etc. Never any heated political discussions. I am fairly middle politically and would consider him just a little right of center for all the years I have known him.

What I call the Q Drip, began over the last year, when political things were dropped into normal everyday situations for absolutely no reason.

Things like, "" If Biden gets elected he'll appoint all Blacks to his Cabinet."" Heard this the first time and said "" What'd you just say? He repeats it and says this will happen and we will be a socialist/marxist country. I'm like why would you say that? No reasonable answer, just a wait you'll see. Obviously doesn't come true, utter nonsense. We were riding bikes and out for ice cream as couples at the time on a gorgeous summer day. WTF.

Months before that he meets some other friends of mine for the first time in March of 2020 and goes on a rant about how the coronavirus is just the flu, it's all made up by the democrats to oust Trump, etc, etc, etc. Very embarrassing for me. Never heard this shit before from him.  I'm like you just met these people, maybe get to know them, ask some questions about them, etc. I get him data on flu deaths verus coronavirus deaths and all the bullshit arguments begin. He's not scared of it, blah, blah, blah. It's inflated to turn us into drones.

Then we get together for my birthday one night in late August with them and another couple, drinks, nice outdoor fire, etc. Good social distance and everything. I'm thinking we'll have a nice time together. Within 5 minutes it turns into a Covid bitchfest. The governor is an ass, this college closed, that high school shut down, with of course nonstop criticism of every organizational body that has to deal with the virus. Non stop criticism. Again I'm like WTF and what would you do smartypants?!?! No answers of course.

The night devolves into more full on Qanon comments and perspective. The coronavirus will go away the day after the election, just you wait and see. I'm like so people across a country are going to fill in ballots, vote, the ballots will be counted and this will make a virus that has penetrated the WORLD population go away? The virus is in other countries too did you know that? Doesn't matter what I say, as logical as I am it makes no dent. A made up virus by the Democrats to get rid of Trump, you just wait and see. ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED.

This turns into more stuff like hydroxychloroquine, BIG PHARMA doesn't want it to work because they won't make any money. I say, ""So all the doctors and hospitals have to be in on it too to then because they want to make more money? You don't think there are any doctors out there who care about the health and safety of their patients?"" If it worked I'm sure we all would be relieved and happy. But it doesn't. Well of course all the doctors and hospitals are in on it too.

There is more of course that night, the pedophile democrats, fake hospital deaths, masks are the worst infringement on our personal freedoms,, the Deep State, etc. This being uttered all the time. I finally GO OFF. Known them over 10 years, never done anything like it and I let them HAVE IT. Felt good and felt bad all at the same time.

It is now 6 months later and we haven't spoken. Found a text from his wife to my wife talking about the 1619 project and how that is destroying our schools across the USA. They haven't changed and aren't going to anytime soon. Think I just need to let them go.

The Q drip is a common tactic  that many of us have experienced and I said/yelled/screamed  ""You are not doing this to me anymore!""

Does it matter? Will they change? I don't know. But I was not going to be the nice guy and ease them back. I said enough is enough. I feel horrible about it, but I just want sane, rational, clear thinking people in my life who are willing to look at something, break it down and examine what is really happening. Then look to empirical evidence for support.

We are looking to talk with people who can share their experiences. Do you have a loved one who has begun researching and “exposing” sex-traffickers? Do you know anyone that sees pedophiles and sex rings everywhere? Do you know any vigilante patriots"" trying to rescue folks on their own?

Qanon decided to use the suffering of children to recruit new victims. This movement claimed to be the voices of silenced children...like me. Qanon is not my voice.
 Qanon spread false conspiracy theories about child sex trafficking that distracts from actual child sex trafficking. They also claimed that trump was going to save us all from the evil democrat lizard pedophiles....when in reality trump has Epstein accusations. He was accused of sodomizing a 12 and 13yo at an epstien party in 1994. There were 2 witnesses and the 12year old was proven kidnapped...not only that but even Maxwell herself was recently quoted mentioning videos of both Clinton and Trump with girls. So  qanon spread a movement that pushes a suspected Epstein pedophile as a hero, while silencing the stories of Epstein victims. The silencing of victims being disguised as the voices of victims is certainly triggering to me. I was mentioned in a news article  after my outcries over qanon caught the attention of a journalist. Every time I spoke out about it online I got shamed and even threatened. Once the article came out I got death threats.

He owns a business and for most of my adult life I've worked for him. It's work I enjoy, an industry I have a passion for, good pay, etc. On a personal level, even if he is emotionally reserved we've always had a deep mutual respect for each other (at least how I've always viewed it). Sure we've had our differences but it's nothing we haven't been able to reconcile about.  At certain points of my life I would probably call him my best friend.

But recently that relationship has been upended by Q. I first got a glimpse when Trump came down those golden escalators and started spewing hateful things about Mexicans. My parents lapped it up, and that's because spoiler alert: we're Mexican! It was all downhill after that. Hilary this, Comey that, Obama yadda yadda. Trump getting elected is what made me start paying attention to politics and now I try to volunteer where I can.

Things we're OK between us during the Trump admin, but things really ramped up after the election. Voter Fraud, Military Take Over, The Storm, Blah Blah. Honestly I was pretty frazzled by this point. During this time I tried avoiding divisive topics (which just seems to keep expanding) but somehow we still circle back to Trump or Biden. 

I look at my dad today and I hardly recognize him, he is just so hateful now. He calls me a socialist and says I hate Trump and think all Trump supporters are racists. Sure I get glimpses of who he used to be but that seems to be less and less as time goes on.  I am so angry a group of trolls is tearing my father away from me and I feel helpless to stop it.  I feel so lost right now and I've begun the process of updating my resume. I am considering leaving my inheritance/family business because I just can't take it anymore.

The most recent thing that set me off was the meme one of them posted about Bill Gates saying cows emit more pollution than a vehicle, and let’s stay in a garage with a cow or car and see who lasts. Her husband commented that the “most educated people don’t have any common sense”. I went ahead and commented and corrected them nicely, but it’ll probably go right over their heads.

My mother is so far down the Q rabbit hole, she believes it is her purpose in life to help others “awaken.” It makes me so sad that she values other things in her life, like her children, career, so little, and has found a soul mission in internet memes. 
-
I’ve tried just about everything with her: intently listening and asking questions without judgement, trying to argue against her points with facts (such as “Biden is the president”), have tried to help get her a job or a hobby actually helping children/volunteering (she quit working before becoming a Qpatriot) and even tried to set boundaries to say that I do not want to talk about anything Q related.
-
She has also sucked my sister into it, but she’s more on the fringes: doesn’t believe in the vaccine but does believe in healing crystals (also, she’s an elementary school teacher.. so that’s great.) my dad isn’t quite as sucked in but he still thinks libs and antifa are the enemy and Trump was a great president.
-
My mom still talks about normal things but we don’t talk as much, but when we do I try to keep it relevant to our relationship/lives. I noticed that when I see her name pop up on my phone, my mood instantly changes now. I feel sad, guilty, angry and anxious. I am planning to have my first baby soon, and I think I am mentally preparing myself for my mom not to be there (since she refuses to get the vaccine.) it makes me so angry and sad that she would choose this Q bullshit over getting to be there for her daughter and meeting her new grandchild. There’s a chance she might surprise me and get vaccinated, but I am trying to prepare for the worst.

I'm so glad i found this sub. this is long, and i apologize for that, but i've been holding this in and need to get it out. 

two of my friends are incredibly intelligent doctoral candidates. they're kind, caring, and some of the smartest people i know. at least they were, i guess. at the beginning of trump's presidential run they insisted that even though they both are republicans, they weren't going to vote for him and that they didn't agree with him on a lot of policies. over time, they've both turned into something that i don't recognize. every time i try and talk to them, it somehow comes back to Q. it's absolute lunacy. they're insistent that I'm part of the enemy because i voted democrat, that a second civil war will break out, that i should be arming myself for when antifa will raid our republican-controlled city and round everyone who voted red up and deport them. my female friend is stockpiling canned food, shelf milk, bottled water, and other non-perishable items for when this antifa raid happens and she needs to hide from them, enough to last her for a few months. apparently, the trump followers and Q believers will be rounded up and shipped to concentration camps. my male friend is thoroughly convinced that every single American who voted in the election actually voted for trump, but dominion voting along with the ""deep state"" changed the 81 million votes biden won. he claims that i made hundreds of copies of my ballot and sent those in with dead peoples' names attached instead of mine. he calls Q drops and the videos from top Q believers on youtube the ""new Bible"" and tells me to throw my copies of the ""old"" one away. they both watched the insurrection on the capital like it was the stanley cup final. I've tried to reason with both of them, show them that none of this is true, but they won't believe me. it's gotten to the point that they won't even let me over for dinner and don't want to see me anymore because they don't want to associate with the enemy.

When I was a kid, my father was a scumbag, but he did a really good job of hiding it. I wholly believed he was a good person, and my ever-patient mother was kind enough to not burst my bubble until I was about 13, when he started to show his true colors.

It started with the 2016 election, but even then I was too brainwashed to understand the flaws in his thinking. I had been told that if Clinton was elected President, the world would end—and I believed all of it, ever bit of conservative propaganda I was fed from toddlerhood onwards. It wasn’t until I got to high school and met some really positive, wonderful people that I realized that not everything was doom and gloom. Not everything had to do with politics and the liberals weren’t out to string us by our toes.

This was also about the same time I discovered I was gay. I was really afraid to come out to my dad, who I had figured out was an insane conspiracy theorist by that time, but I hoped he would still be proud of me. After all, I was still the same person. I was still his little girl.

Evidently not.

His tirades had no end. He believed that I was “too far gone” and that my “liberal school” had converted me. He pulled my little sister out of her own school and put her in a christian online school called Freedom Academy. I could tell that I was starting to loose her, and we argued so often we were barely on speaking terms. I couldn’t take the mental abuse anymore, so I left. I’m glad that I did, but it seems that quarantine has made his attitude so, so much worse.

I’m writing this because I called him the other day, trying to get an update on my twin sisters that were born last October. He gave me two seconds of peace, and I honestly believed he wasn’t going to talk about it, before he started to argue with me about the pandemic again, calling face masks “scare tactics” and the quarantine organized “so the liberals could kick Trump out of office” because OBVIOUSLY he’s the best President we’ve ever had. 

He was angry at why I hadn’t already come out to visit him, even though none of them take precautions and I don’t feel like endangering my new family with COVID. He started accusing me of not loving my family, of being selfish and psycho because I didn’t agree with him and his batshit, deep state views.

I’m so tired, I don’t know what to do. I want to go see him this summer, if only to meet my new sisters, but I’m at a loss. He’s always been very persuasive and manipulative so I’m worried that if I go he might hold my siblings over my head and force me to stay. Cutting him off isn’t an option, either, because I’d lose all contact with my siblings and extended family.

You have to plant seeds of doubt and hope they take root and grow.  I recently learned about one of these seeds.  It is about the moon landing, but you can pivot it to Q.

Based upon the actual footage documenting the moon landing it is estimated that 400,000 people would have to be colluding on the conspiracy.  NONE of these alleged co-conspirators came forward since.  That is completely unrealistic.  We all know how hard it is for any group to keep anything secret for long, to have so many non-military personnel and corporations participating it would be absolutely impossible.

So, how many people would have to collude in a Q-like set of conspiracies?  Because it is not just one conspiracy, but several (election fraud, baby-eating, vaccinations, etc), a huge number of people would have to be involved.

Example: so where are the parents of ANY child that was supposedly stolen and eaten?  Why didn’t the parents file a missing child report?  Why didn’t the school?  Grandparents?  Immediate family?  

To believe Q you are assuming that parents and immediate family, police, child services, missing child CHARITIES, religious organizations who help children, services people who would be responsible for preparing the dead children to be eaten (because the rich don’t cook for themselves), and more would have to be actively complicit in keeping this secret IN ADDITION to the government.  This would be thousands of thousands of people worldwide in addition to the rich people running it all.

I finally couldn't stand it when, yesterday, she texted me some of her ""data"" and started going on about all the evidence of thousands of deaths and permenant injury people are experiencing from taking the Covid vaccine.

I blew up and answered her sharply. It went back and forth. She had the nerve to tell me that she was telling me all this in order to be able to say I told you so after I get my vaccine and, probably, die.

I told her I'm done and took myself off of our family group chat.

She promptly texted me privately and called me a typical Democrat who can't have an argument with the facts (I'm a Republican, as she knows). Then she called me a hypocrite.

I sent her a long voice note with barely restrained anger, telling her that the issues isn't whether she or I are correct about the vaccine. It's about her disrespect and overstepping boundaries by not allowing me to have my own opinions.

She had the gall to say this was all about her being concerned for me and how much she loves me and doesn't want to lose me, blah, blah, vomit.

When I calmed down later, I was able to think more clearly. I knew this ""concern"" for my health wasn't right somehow but couldn't figure out why right then. Now I know what it's about. This isn't about concern for my health or an over abundance of sisterly love. This is plain and simple EGO. She can't accept that I don't agree with her ""health data"". She has to push and push and push until I give in and agree. The proof is that comment about needing to be able to say I told you so. 

There's probably a big dose of hidden uncertainty in her beliefs as well, since she needs my approval so badly.

Understanding this makes me feel a little better but that fight was super unpleasant and I had a terrible headache for the rest of the day.

Of course this conspiracy dates back 5 years ago when claims were made rovers were staged and photos taken on Devon island in Canada. I blame this absurd belief on Q because my family once fully believed the rover missions were legitimate and were fascinated with the missions! It wasn't till after they became cult followers of Q they flipped and now literally believe every little conspiracy on the internet regardless of whether or not it has any backing of evidence solely because it's something they hope/want to be true.

When this claim regarding perseverance was made I blatantly replied ""That's about the most STUPID thing I've heard you say thus far! You really need to use your brain and STOP believing these bullshit conspiracies you read on the internet because not everything on the net is true just because you want it to be true!"" Of course they took offense and said ""You just wait...I'll find pictures of terrain that matches the island and then you'll feel like the idiot for believing it actually happened!"" 🤦‍♂️

I'm now at the point I just refute every conspiracy claim they come up with. When they make a claim I immediately start researching into bunking but they inevitably refuse to accept the facts because it's not what they want to believe.

 She said that complaining about Qanon and its believers is an overly 'woke' thing.\* It really pissed me off. The Qanons are abusive and toxic. I told her that this is tearing families apart and she disregarded it. She disregarded thousands of people's experiences with this nonsense. 

She claims the article proves that brainwashing isn't a real thing, which the article does address, but didn't mention that psychologists cited in the article believe that maybe these people just might be doing this all on their own.

She ended up leaving one day and flying to Los Angeles, fearing what she would do especially since LA is seen as a liberal area my brother flew out there to make sure nothing happened. She than made him take her to Michael Jackson’s house i guess because of beliefs of child sex rings? My brother said she was so sure of the code to get through the gate because of info she received from qanon members and even said crazy things to the security guard she also started saying crazy things about her mother in law sexually abusing her kids with no bearing in truth what so ever she said she “just knew it” After getting her to come to our area in Florida and letting her know the severity that she’s going to lose her kids due to abandonment and crazy tweets both there fathers were worried for her mental health she agreed to goto mental health treatment. After leaving one facility and going to another none of us knew anything about she refused any kind of medication and hasn’t done therapy since she left. Her ex husband won’t let her see her daughter whos older because she’s not taking meds or doing therapy and he wants to see results and I can’t blame him. It seems like she has no plan and I feel so bad for her kids and am still angry at how she’s acting. We’ve gotten into fights recently and the rest of my family is almost ok with it outside of the episode since there on the same “team” it suites narrative. She left one of the most liberal states and I feel like she feels better being down here still since it’s republican which is so silly to me and crazy to leave your kids over. She’s always been very smart and a good mother and I don’t know what I can do to help her. She keeps it under wraps for the most part and when she’s around I try to avoid political conversations but sometimes can’t bite my tongue when the misinformation and lies start coming out.

My ex best friend, who I was friends with for 18 years, thinks ANTIFA is going to storm her family’s home. 

We grew up together, and in the last year she has had told me her darkest thoughts of suicide. As the elections came closer, she became more paranoid that BLM and communists were going to storm her suburban family home. Yet, she went to attend a Trump rally a few nights before the election, and was an active member of the Walk Away Campaign. 

Once Biden won the election, she was convinced Trump was not going to leave the White House. Yet, she continued to also threaten suicide and eventually, my self and another friend who works in mental health care got her to commit into an outpatient program for depression. She also has an addiction to alcohol and LSD. 

Now she believes that neo-Nazis don’t exist (???), that it was wrong for her to join an outpatient depression program, and that children are being trafficked by Hollywood.there were many other deep personally problems going on, so we stopped being friends. She got angry at me for not believing any of this, and then gaslighted me. 

I recently listened to a podcast talking about QAnon and it hit me... I think my friend is part of QAnon. I never put two and two together because I was more concerned about her suicidal intentions. I’ve tried everything I can, as well as her closets friends. Her family also follows QAnon, so they don’t think she has any mental health issues. Her brother is the worst too, because he wears his MAGA hat on social media. 

She reaches out every several days to talk, but then when I try to be polite and talk to her, she tells me I’m wrong for being liberal. My friend is also VERY well known in the area, and I’m genuinely concerned about her reputation. I don’t side with her, but out of respect of our years of friendship, I don’t want anyone hurting her, even if she is creating this trouble herself.

Thank you everyone in this community for your bravery and support.

My parents have gotten to the point of stopping their local newspaper to subscribe to Epoch Times, my mom has joined the local Republican women’s group after never joining anything of that nature before and leaving their old church because they were “too liberal” on social justice. It seems most local Republican chapters in predominantly white areas wholeheartedly still embrace Trump and all the conspiracy theories that go along with it. My dad recently sent me the Mike Lindell “documentary” as his great example of election fraud and has sent me Gateway Pundit links.

In the lead up to the election, I really struggled with accepting my parents’ about face on Trump and acceptance of more bizarre claims. I thought about ways to convince them how terrible he was and thought there was some magic that could “save” them. We had a big fight after I decided to not visit them for Christmas due to them not taking proper COVID precautions. But after a lot of soul searching, I realized that this was a later stop on a decades long journey outside of the mainstream.

My parents’ personalities can be vindictive and negative. I think that has roots in mental health issues but has left them ripe to embracing certain religious ideologies that lean into perceived persecution. These leaders use charged, emotional, and fear filled propaganda almost identical to right wing secular media. It aligns with the worst parts of loving, honest people. 

My parents haven’t evolved with the times. Leaders like Franklin Graham and James Dobson, although always fringe didn’t seem nearly as much so when I grew up in the 90s. Society continued to evolve and gain new understanding, but my parents kept following the same leaders who refused to update their views on claimed “religious principle”. It fed right into the perceived persecution narrative and when that is your frame of mind, it is easy to find a scapegoat.

Evangelical beliefs leave people really open to believing these types of wild ideas in other aspects of their life. Religion became a larger part of my parents’ life over time and along with that wilder ideas about creationism, distrust of science, distrust of the same educational institutions they went to, etc.

So, having a leader like Trump only tapped into an existing network of fringe beliefs and gave them the ultimate platform.  You could previously laugh or shrug off these ideals because they weren’t molding public policy or causing 10s of thousands of unnecessary deaths from people not taking covid seriously.  Many religious sects have given bigotry a cover in the US for a long time and I think we’re at the breaking point of what that results in.

The conversations were always full of sarcastic laughs and a lot of hate. He started to form a victim complex where anytime anything happened politically he started to act like he was being oppressed. We live in an 800k house which is a 2 min walk from the beach. And he retired at 58. 

2 days after the election we watched Trump's press conference where he said he believed the election was rigged. I asked him what he thought. He said Democrats fabricated 5-10 million ballots and that he was in a rush to move to a red state before ""Democrats put him in a concentration camp"". I walked out and I haven't been able to talk or look at him much since. I'm in a bind financially as I've started a new career but I'm trying to desperately to move out.

[Can Cult Studies Offer Help With QAnon? The Science Is Thin.](https://undark.org/2021/02/24/cult-studies-qanon/)

I'm not surprised to see that cult deprogramming hasn't been found to be effective. My understanding is that controversial actions by concerned family and friends like surprise interventions for substance abuse and other actions such as kidnapping one's child for behavioral 'boot camps' are not necessarily helpful as well.\*  Kidnapping seems downright unethical as well.

This article is really interesting and a bit discouraging. Michael Schulson who has written in several high-profile publications about science and psychology contacted me after seeing a post I wrote asking about Qanon deprogramming. He now edits and writes for [Undark.org](https://undark.org/)  Undark is a non-profit, editorially independent digital magazine exploring the intersection of science and society. His articles for [undark.org](https://undark.org/)  can be found [here](https://undark.org/undark-author/michael-schulson/) and other articles he's written can be found [here.](https://michaelschulson.weebly.com/selected-samples.html)

EDIT: I should also mention that the discussion of brainwashing vs agency is interesting. I know there has been a lot of discussions, here and in other places about whether the recent political climate and conspiracy theories are just bringing out something that was already there: racism, abusiveness, and general unpleasantness. That's even more concerning in my opinion. They are actively choosing to be this way.

\* I know it may be an emotional topic but please, no angry comments about the intervention comment.

New to this forum.  Looking for some advice. 

My in-laws have become q-obsessed and its causing challenges between my wife and them and my wife and I.  The background....  My in-laws retired early in 2008... big house on a lake... they were hit pretty substantially in the recession and I don't believe they've recovered.  They've since downsized to a smaller house.  At that time, my father-in-law pulled all his $ from the stock market at the bottom and started investing Gold, Silver, and other sketchy sounding investments.  They got caught up in the Iraqi Dinar scheme in the early 2010's and would bring a tupperware of Dinar to bury in our yard when they visited because you ""couldn't trust the banks"" and they needed access to it when it revalues... or whatever it was supposed to do.  I never really got involved and kind of just left it along.  At the beginning of Covid they brought boxes of freeze dried military foods for us... which I also thought was weird.  Then this fall we discovered they were Qanon followers.  It started when at their house when my brother-in-law pulled me aside and mentioned some weird child sex trafficking/Democrats beliefs they were telling him about (my b-in-law is a NRA loving conservative).  Again.. I largely stayed out of it.  The heat turned up when my m-in law was staying with us for a month watching our months old daughter.  Trump came up and I questioned how she could handle his horrible tweeting and terrible handling of covid.  Her response was a bit odd... ""you just wait"", and agreed you can't watch just foxnews... but then saying cause its too mainstream...  And also questioning if I was a BLM supporter... (which I don't actively support, but have no problems with it).  It was a bit contentious but overall the conversation was fine.  Basically, cause I don't support Trump I must be a liberal... not the case... just think he is terrible.   This next weekend, she attended a maskless Trump rally... which forced me to take two weeks of work to watch our daughter because of concerns about covid at the rally...  She apologized profusely and ""covid never crossed her mind"".  Long story short, they've continued to express all the Qanon beliefs to my brother-in-law, which he calls me about alarmed.  He's a strong right guy (who can acknowledge Trump is an ass) but that makes him safe to talk to for them.  I've send my wife data/podcast interviews. etc on how to deal with Qanon people... she gets upsets and doesn't want to think about it.  Her relationship with her parents is becoming a bit fake...call them to be nice and talk about their grandkids.  She's lamented she hasn't had a real conversation with her dad in months...  They are anti-mask, anti-covid, anti-covid vaccine.... it gets tough to talk to them when dealing with covid is a big part of my wife and I's jobs.  Seems like almost anything can draw a snide anit- establishment, media, etc remark.  We are getting concerneda about our elementary school kids being around them. We are thinking no more weekends at grandma and grandpas post covid...  Are we over-reacting?  Do we need to confront them?  My wife already did confront them about covid and the impact is has on our jobs and kid's schooling if we get exposed...They are honoring our wishes when they are around us, but following no guidelines on their own.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,138453,public,confidence,self,Q In-laws,0,[],0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lrli3r/q_inlaws/,some_ads,7,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My name is Bree and I'm a journalist working for WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. Yesterday, a heartbreaking article was written in the Washington Post about this sub, and specifically mentioned a ""Tyler"" in the Minneapolis area: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/conspiracy-theories-qanon-family-members/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/conspiracy-theories-qanon-family-members/)  


I was wondering if anyone could help me get a hold of Tyler, or any other survivors in Minnesota. Many in Minnesota don't realize the full extent of QAnon, and believe it's only centered in ""red states,"" certainly not true. I'd like to do a piece on the effect this conspiracy theory has on people's lives in Minnesota. I think it's a critical issue that needs attention.

I wasn't mean. I simply don't believe his BS. He needs to get off the internet.

My brother is an adult child of abuse. I believe generational trauma has a lot to do with people’s susceptibility to this shit. Having a sense of control and answers for why the world is messed up is really appealing when you’ve never had them before.

Bro has experienced homelessness and is a recovering addict (SURPRISE). He has a fractured sense of self to begin with and has always enjoyed being just a little bit cruel to me. Now his traditional, bully-esque mansplaining has been replaced with QSplaining and there’s just no fucking stopping it. 

I could just bail, but for the fact that he’s currently living with my mom in the house I own as he works to renovate his own house next door. He’s taking care of her, which is great, but I can’t even go see her without this nonsense. Expressing boundaries doesn’t work - he is COMPELLED to holler about this crap until he runs out of breath. Luckily he’s a felon and can’t wave his shotgun around without ramifications, but (and yeah, it keeps getting better) he actually has oversized adrenal glands and his temper is starting to get out of control.

Mom feels okay living with him (“we don’t discuss politics and he goes to get all the groceries and we do puzzles together”) but when I come over, it’s a whole different game. The house feels unsafe. And it’s my fucking house.

Now we are roommates and nothing more. We don’t talk at all about Q or Trump but I strongly suspect he’s still involved to a degree, mostly reading. What he does talk about nonstop is his spiritual journey and the Bible. I’m a Christian and don’t believe that just reading the Bible and looking to really feel love for Jesus is a true end purpose of becoming holy. One could debate that I suppose but I have no energy for that as I’m moving forward with my own life.

What I do need to vent is my anger today. I am aware it’s part of the grief process and that I’m grieving over someone who is still alive but an entirely different person. I am angry at him for breaking my trust. More than that I’m angry at Trump and Q and all their supporters who idolize the man and the movement. How carelessly they broke relationships of all kinds with absolutely zero compassion or regret.
They turned people into monsters for their own selfish gain.

I really want to light into my roommate and tell him what a complete fool he’s been. He has lost someone who would have grown with him spiritually in a loving relationship.

I'll keep the details simple so as not to embarrass anyone that doesn't deserve it:

I know an aggressive and uneducated man, who is unfortunately tied to someone I care about. He's always been a dbag, but the Q stuff gave him new reasons to push people around. He is relentless in his violent opinions of any perceived liberals, frequently spouts ignorant and racist comments, and has yet to be held accountable for any of his abuses.

As many of you are likely aware, sometimes we have to be the bigger person and just sort of let the stupid roll off us and not argue, which I have done countless times when dealing with these ppl....but eventually even the nicest person should defend what is right and condemn what is unacceptable.

Basically I snapped. It happened after he posted the following:

""Might be time to ask people if
 they're Republicans or Democrats
 and if they admit to being a
 Democrat kill them right then and
 there and go to their parents house
 and ask the same question.""

Oh, and when the state Capitol was boarded up after they received threats (following the 6th), he said ""I hope they burn that bitch down.""

I told him more ppl could see his posts than he thought, that it was sickening, and he was potentially calling for the execution of his own friends, neighbors, and family.

He responded that he didn't need me in his life, which is true and doesn't bother me.

No one in politics is going to be convincing her. She is way past her school days, and she has already chosen to ignore the son who is far more educated than she is, anyway. She has given up her son and her grandchildren in favor of this twisted fantasy.

How does this all end in anything but violence? My mother and her awful husband are armed, they're angry, and they're delusional.

I listened to a podcast that actually brought up a good point though.  Q-Anon, in addition to being conservative, also has elements of mysticism, new age thinking and counter-culture.  What would be considered left-leaning and some former Obama voters have found themselves enthralled.  Some find Q talk meshes well with their talk of enlightenment.  Q fulfills former hippies need to feel as a group apart, participating in counter-culture movement.  

I personally find it disturbing that formerly free-love hippies(not all) would now actively engage as a group that desires to see enemies destroyed.

Came out with a very “get your guns ready, they are after our white rights and our bibles!” mindset. 
I don’t mean to say that this happens to all low-education persons going into the military, I have nothing but gratitude for our troops and service members, and I’m proud of the service these two cousins have given. But, this is what has happened to my cousins. They went in one way, came out another way. They may have been highly susceptible to certain things they heard, to begin with. They had an evangelical, probably racist upbringing. 

Anyway they are not yet Q, as far as I can tell, but it sure is a slippery slope and I’m wondering if it is inevitable... 

They are obsessed with being transphobic. Like, someone asking to have certain pronouns used is taken as a complete infringement on THEIR rights, somehow. Obsessed with invalidating trans people. I learned this transphobia is a door to Q for some people. 
 They also absolutely hate the idea that anyone would talk about systemic racism or white privilege. This is hard because my own work is in correcting problems of systemic inequality. So I really don’t associate with them much anymore, it’s just too much. They really take me saying “we have systemic issues of racism that can be corrected if communities work together and change policy, legislation and culture” as me saying “down with the white man! You’re all evil! You all personally did this to our American system and I want to take your very rights away!”. It’s ridiculous. 

And of course the second amendment is their GOD. 

I just see them going further and further down this path, where they will not use common sense, where they feel victimized by any change that honors the reality of POC or trans people... and I feel like they are playing with fire. I leave them alone mostly but there are small children involved so I worry that they will go full Q. They are young men with their lives ahead of them. It’s very worrisome. And they are absolutely full of anger, anger that they are asked to consider that anyone who doesn’t look like them may have a different life experience and may have different needs. Anger that they can’t flaunt all their giant guns and be applauded for being gun-nuts everywhere they go. SO MUCH anger at Hillary Clinton for even EXISTING. And so much trump love still. 

So how slippery is the slope? If it walks like a Q and talks like a Q, but hasn’t openly claimed Q or any of the particularly insane conspiracies... is there a chance they will just stay where they are, idealogically? Where they are is NOT good, but for their children’s sake I do see it as better than full blown Q.

Looking at family photo albums, I knew my dad had 2 kids from a previous marriage (half siblings), but we never met. Fast forward to 2006, and I get a call from my half sister. She found out about us after our dad died, and it was very exciting to have new family!

Everything was great. I flew out of state to visit them a few times. We would keep in touch by calling each other every few months. We had our differences (I'm a damn Yankee atheist progressive, she and her husband are southern conservative Christians), but family is family. We cared about each other and everything was great.

Then 2016 happened. Her husband made things absolutely intolerable. A recent visit was marred by ""discussions"" about politics, and her husband would constantly post the most extremist, vile, awful stuff on Facebook. I've since left Facebook, and haven't talked to them since.

I feel awful about it, but what do you do when people you love become really involved in a cult? I simply can't reconcile with that part of the family and their bigoted, ignorant beliefs. What's sad is that they have two daughters that are just the sweetest, smartest kids. They'll likely become poisoned by whatever mind-rot they espouse, and I can't do anything about it.

To anyone who lost family and friends to all of this, I'm empathetic. I think it's important to share our stories so that we know we're not alone. If the time ever comes where these folks see the error in their ways, I think it's important to let them know how you feel/felt, and attempt to reconcile.

That was all reinforced by women not having their own money or jobs (usually) so they couldn’t leave, especially with multiple kids (5 and much more was common.) It was acceptable to spank ( or in some place more) kids, and you could require them to be seen and not heard.

POC were “suitably “ deferential and knew their place. That was often cheap, dirty labor and service jobs. Their living situations were far away or otherwise hidden from view, so one didn’t have to think about it.

Christian values were flaunted. of course chastity was enforced on women much more stringently than men. Husbands often got to make the decisions about their wive’s bodies.

It's the freaking smug, haughty, superior attitude all the time, everyone is a fool for not believing in Q ect. No matter how many dates and goal posts pass with literally nothing happening.

of all, I honestly believe that some 'news' sites and Facebook echo chambers are like drugs and far right followers and conspiracy theorists are the addicts, they need to be weaned off this feed and drip fed with some positivity. 

A friend of mine was DEEP into this and I don't want to go into too much detail or background as it hurts too much. I have known this person for over 20 years. My one last shot to help him worked. I want to share it with you.   

His phone was experiencing problems and I said I would be happy to look at it for him. He needed to replace his SD card and I said I would back up his pictures and reset his phone with a new card. 

As I was doing this and going through his old pictures, it made me really sad as I could see how his interests changed from loving the outdoors and being in nature to quite unhinged beliefs about conspiracy theories. 

After backing up his pictures and sorting his phone out, I logged into Facebook on his phone and unfollowed ALL the hate and conspiracy groups he follows on Facebook, literally every single one. I then started following picture pages like 'Beautiful villages' and woodworking pages with arts and crafts stuff that he USED to love. His hobbies included woodworking so I followed a few pages on that. He also had an old car he has been wanting to fix up so I followed some pages on them. 

I gave him his phone back and he complained a few times about how Facebook ""is all messed up"" and I said I would look into it for him but never did.

This was about 3 months ago. 

Now everytime he grabs his phone to get his next 'hit' of confirmation bias, he is faced with scroll after scroll of non-offensive material. NO news, NO hate, NO propaganda. Slowly, he is emerging out of this and each time he shares non offensive material from one of these pages it makes me smile.

My brother recently told the family that he “can’t talk about it” but he’s being vetted by a group called the Idaho Assembly. He lives in Boise. He says it’s a group of “good people standing up for our rights” and that this Biden thing is “terrifying for America.” Sounds harmless right?

He proceeds to tell me that they use VPN or dark web to communicate so they can’t be tracked. They require you never tell anyone any more specifics. They’re “vetting” him. He was brought in by a longtime trusted old friend. Sounding less harmless. 

I have this horrible gut-wrenching feeling it’s something much darker than he’s revealing. I’ve had my suspicions that’s he’s caught up in Q or at least sympathizes. He’s very prone to that kind of conspiratorial thinking, always has been. He thinks the election was rigged, etc etc. Over 6-8 months his Facebook activity went from an occasional birthday wish or tagged photo to sharing far-right propaganda daily. I won’t list all of the different theories he subscribes to, but suffice to say he believes many of the ideas people who are scared of progress and misinformed believe in (my commentary). 

I asked him explicitly if this group was violent and expressed my deep concern for getting caught up in any “secret” group. He of course says it’s not violent and that he has a right to fight for his beliefs. 

I’m posting this because I’m trusting my immediate instinct that this sounds dangerous, that something is off. Has anyone heard of this particular group? Are there specific militant or violent sects of QAnon? Or is Q not necessarily linked to violent groups, just online stuff?

Anyone with similar experiences to share would be very welcome.

Thankfully, I have none, so I’m having a hard time understanding for myself how they think. 
So I’ve been through my own trauma and hardships in my life, in fact similar to what many Q followers have gone through. As a result, I feel like sometimes I have a heightened need for outside validation in my emotions and perceptions of reality to assure myself I’m seeing things clearly. This is probably a result of the gaslighting I’ve been subject to at a developmental age. This is just generally speaking. 
My question is, how does this thought/idea of “could I be wrong? Could my perception not be based in truth?” not occur to Q followers at all??? They’re constantly being confronted by things counter to what “their truth” is, by media, by scientists, by family members. Do they never ever even entertain the thought that their perception of things are skewed? How do they constantly reassure themselves that THEY are the ones with their heads on straight? Even if I tried to surround myself with an echo chamber of likeminded people, I don’t think I could ever isolate myself completely from the haunting thought of whether or not I was always right — especially when relationships with others and my own well-being is on the line. 
The person who gaslit me in my youth was narcissistic. The narcissistic person would have their own perception of reality that they would push on me as fact. Is this directly related to the way Q followers think? Do they all suffer from a narcissistic personality where their agenda is solid as stone? Do you think these individuals have doubts deep deep down, but they have a way of dismissing them before they rise to surface enough to have them question their beliefs? If so, in what way do they do this?
I’m just baffled by Q anon followers’ unwavering ability to believe in their narrative. Even the things I am most sure of in my life, still have enough curiosity surrounding them to allow for doubt.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,138341,public,confidence,self,How do Q followers never doubt their perception?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lr5c8e/how_do_q_followers_never_doubt_their_perception/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's the thing.  Before Jan 6th occured I had several of my Trumpist family members call me and ask me if me and my husband were ready for the 6th.  They were insinuating a civil war was going to start that day, to be prepared.   I remember my response being, 

""yes I'm ready to get these election results solidified and on to a new President""

Of course they stayed quiet.  My mother a Trumpist also noted she knew some people going to the capital to support Trump and that she thought they were crazy bc of how bad it's gonna get down there.  A Trumpist calling other Trumpist crazy....lol...

anyway, Mind you this was first few days of January that my fam asked me about Jan 6.  When I responded to my brother about it, he called me a POS on fb, told me to not come running to him for protection when shit hits the fan then  blocked me....Nice!  A very close friend of 33years also blocked me after calling me a communist and telling me I live in a fantasy world and will be crying when I see whats to come and wishing I listened.

So my question is this...IF Trump didn't instigate, and the Q cult didn't instigate the 6th then WTH were all these wackos talking about?  They obviously knew or were having communications amongst themselves in their groups and chat rooms!  

My ex friend who blocked me on fb of course now cries that these weren't Trump supporters who attacked the capital...of course they were the democrat liberals looking to make Trump country look bad...of course!!! SMH. yet this ex friend told me before the 6th that I'd be crying when I see whats coming.  How interesting!  

So have any of you experienced similar notices or questions from ur Qrazies before the 6th as if they knew something was being planned?

I mean it's pretty obvious to me and I know all you agree but they can't even see this when it's as clear as day and I question them about it!!!!  

We are seriously in the upside-down with these people.

Now none of my Qrazies mentioned anything to me about March...I wonder what they're thinking there, it's pretty obvious to me they're dreaming up something.

His businesses impacted by COVID, like a lot of businesses were, but he has not had to close down any of his businesses. 

I live in Los Angeles and unless you live under a rock, we went through a horrible COVID crisis that peaked (I think) a month ago. We were told not to dial 911. There was a massive pile-up of bodies, ambulances lined up around the block outside hospitals, gift shops converted into Covid wards, and things got so bad that they even allowed more cremations than are usually allowed. 

My Dad texted the family group chat that COVID would definitively be over in April due to herd immunity. This article was written by a pancreatic surgeon. I responded by saying ""I sure hope so, LA is still dealing with the aftermath."" 

QDad: Those numbers are garbage. 

Me: Whose? The Doctors and nurses? The funeral directors? The coroner's office which has the national guard with trailers for dead bodies? My own self bc I had to go to the big Kaiser to pick up a prescription and saw the madness from across the parking lot? HOW ARE WE ALL LYING?! AND WHY??

QDad: You can't beat the numbers. There were 0-3.4% excess deaths last year. And that's the CDC. Look at the math. 

\[It was not, in fact, the CDC.\]

\*\*Me googling that on the computer\*\*\*

*Sending link.* 

Me: Dad that's not true according to peer reviewed articles by infectious disease doctors and public health experts. We actually have more excess deaths than usually reported in excess of what has been reported as covid deaths. 

QDad: Thats not true. Do the math. The numbers are the numbers and the math is the math. 

Me: Okay but where are you getting the numbers because I cannot see. Dad, is this going to be like the election thing? 

QDad: You are too smart for this. The military vote in Fulton County was 85% for Biden when in the rest of the country the military vote was 75% for Trump. That's as impossible as getting struck by lightning and winning the lottery on the same day. The numbers don't lie. 

Me: Dad, I am looking at exit polls and the Military's own polling and I do not see anywhere that 75% of active members or Veterans were polling/voting for Trump. I am looking at the Military Times' website, which has the military much more evenly split. And I would think that yes, the military vote would be significantly different in Atlanta (Fulton County) than nationwide, as it has much higher rate of Black voters, first time Democratic voters, and Democratic voters in general. Can you send link so that we are on the same page? 

QDad: The numbers are the numbers. The math is the math. That is so many standard deviations apart its a statistical improbability. You can't argue with math. And yes, the Republican vote in the military is 75%. 

Me: \*\*\*\*physically doing math trying to keep up\*\*\* So actually, I think it would be statistically very possible for Atlanta's vote to be very different than the general vote. I mean...because the Fulton County vote in general is an indicator. Dad,  do you mean they voted Republican or voted for Trump? Like 2004 Bush or Trump 2016?

His answer was silence, I asked the brother of my late grandfather about this (he is 104) and I was answered, ""in the 30s i also had to deal with fascist friends, when they started with that issue I asked them to change subject otherwise i would leave, I care more about you done your opinions, you decide"". So he was able to keep his friends for at least 30 years more, but i dont know if I will be so successful.

The second one is Pedro, I met him since I was 5 and we even purchase a car together, he was always a little nerdy and in the lost couple of years he started paying atention to all these culture wars. Abortion, homosexuality, sexual rights etc.

He become obsessed with these issues and later went full anon. He believes so badly about election fraud, covid 19 conspiracies and qanon itself. I told him all arguments possible showing that the fraud was a lie and he answered me ""don't try changing my mind, that's criminal"", I knew this was too much.

I started reading regarding disinformation, conspiracies and other far right issues, I couldnt understand how people so smart and centered decided to adopt these lies. The last time I met Pedro he started with the Dominion conspiracies and I told him it was absolutely wrong and that the judicial branch even said so, and he answered me ""Great idea believing in the judicial branch"".

Later went on and accused me of changing his mind and i answered that is what sects say ""dont dare changing my mind"". 

I wish still being Christian and Pedro's friend but I can't believe these are the people i met so long before, my friends were not fascists.

went to the beach and parked where we always parked. I didn’t see his car, so I thought I was fine. I’ve been a lot recently and haven’t run into him. I saw him as I walked over the boardwalk, but ignored it. 

He ran up to me and told me he’s had dreams about me and knew he would see me today. He told me that I was incredibly hostile towards him, and I was. I told him I didn’t like or love who he has turned into.

He asked if I would still accept I was wrong if he had proof...and he definitely had proof. It would just take him a month or two to get it to me. He kept insisting he had proof. I told him to tell me what it was, and that he had 10 minutes. 

The next 45 minutes were spent with him telling me some fantasy story about “people who don’t agree working together to find the truth,” and being upset that I wouldn’t listen to him. I told him I didn’t want some bullshit fantasy that he was laying out. 

I was doing okay. It has been about a month. I have codependent tendencies and this was a huge issue for me early on, but I remained NC. I was doing well, all things considered. I feel like, while our interaction solidified my decision to leave, mentally and emotionally it put me back a few steps. Several, to be honest. 

He told me that he will continue to try to find the truth for me. That he will wait for me. That he will try to make things better for me. I told him I’m moving and I thought he wanted a free ride to where I’m going. I’m not in danger of him going crazy and stalking me (I’ve been through that before). 

But I genuinely think he wants to “wake me up” and wants a happy life for us. But he’s doubled or even tripled down on the Q stuff since we broke up, and I partially think that it’s because we broke up. He’s had nothing else going for him and none of his friends agree with his bullshit. 

It’s hard to see it hurt him so much, but it really solidifies my decision to leave him. Things only got worse. A small part of me hoped that leaving would wake him up. He finally admitted outright to following QAnon, so that was validating.

I grew up with  not a single vaxine an homeopathy as the one true medizin. It took me a long time to finaly question my Mothers ways and getting shots behind her back as soon as I turned 18. I really dont have the best relationship with her but since the vax for covid came out she went totaly crazy. I suspect strongly she is on the way to depression or already has some kind of mental illness. The thing is she just wont listen to anything that isnt her way. She is building her own bubble around this baaaaaad baaaaaaad vax. She is posting articels of conspiracy websites and stopt talking to her friends. She tried to convince my grandma to not get the shot. (I had to calm her down after that because she was worried I mithg think as my Mother) She is more and more shutting herself from anyone who tries to talk sens into her. My sister had a huge argument as she was the only one left talking to her about vax and these believes flying around. But my Mother just thinks she is the one who understood the worl and we were just to closed minded. She thinks this Bill Gates stuff is stupid for the ones not smart enough to see throuth all it. I know this woman. (19 years with her made me having to see a psychologist) I am about to shut contact with her but I feel awful by just letting her in this hole she is digging herself... After all is this kind of ignorance the base on wich these people life. So any tips on how to maybe get to a woman who is so full of herself that kinda anything that wont fit into her selfmade world is stupid and close minded(and an attac on her as a person)?

If you're not interested in participating in the audio series I would also like to speak to you for more background on this issue. 

I can be reached at my e-mail [djgreen@usc.edu](mailto:djgreen@usc.edu) or in private message here. I'm also more than happy to clarify any questions you have in the comments.

&gt;The Thinkin Collective is a private, but searchable group run by The Thinking Project. Anyone is welcome; from Qbelievers looking for ways out of the rabbit hole, family members and loved ones, and volunteers. It will take all of us to work toward a shared reality.
TTP is building a community of action.
We see the heavy toll that conspiracy theories, most recently QAnon, is having on QBelievers and their loved ones.
A collective of technology pros, mental health experts, researchers, media, and concerned citizens decided to be part of the solution. Acknowledging that the approach to this process is a critical component to rectify the problems QAnon has created, TTP was launched.

warning for talk of child sexual abuse / pedophilia.

.

i, like many, have lost my parents to qanon. theyre detached from reality, even going as far as to say biden is being ""hologrammed"" into the white house through special cameras, that hes not actually there. they believe in pizzagate, anti vaxx stuff, that democrats are eating babies, trump is the second coming of christ, all that weird stuff.

the thing that bugs me the most, however, is that as far as my knowledge goes, the point of Qanon is that theres supposedly some whole underground deep-state thing(?) where every democrat ever is a pedophile. and trump, the guy who has multiple rape allegations against him, the guy who raped children and acts creepy with his own daughter...is somehow gonna be the one who stops all this? really?

growing up i had experienced repeated sexual abuse both by a neighbor and a classmate, starting from the age of 4. i told my parents what was happening, and what did they do? they ignored it. they saw me come home with bruises and they just brushed it under the rug. my school didnt give a shit either because the principal was a pedophile too and shut down any of my teachers concerns. they allowed it to continue for years. now im an adult with PTSD, an eating disorder, and addiction issues.

knowing this, and thinking about their attachment to Qanon, i cant help but feel so, so incredibly fucking angry and betrayed. why is this grown man who raped multiple children is the one you care so much about and not your child? was my abuse just not worth trying to help? do they think i lied about it? i dont know what to do. seeing them worship and kiss the shoes of the man who hurt children, made them go through the same thing i did, makes me so sick to my stomach. i cant even imagine how the victims of him feel; to have to see their abuser walk around in the white house being hailed as this all-good evil stopping pedophile killing man, or whatever it is. its disgusting.

i hear my parents talk about how they think that ""if the victims were *really* hurt they would have reported it when it was happening!"" as if they werent children. CHILDREN. they were probably too young and scared to understand what was happening at the time. i never ever want to hear these people talk about how they care so much about saving kids when theyre worshipping a child rapist.

i really, really cant bring myself to be nice anymore or feel pity. i hate this entire movement with everything i have and feel disgust towards anyone who supports it. they are turning a blind eye to actual people who were hurt as children as well as children who are still being hurt, all while worshipping a pedophile. its disgusting and i will never be able to forgive my parents, not after this.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,138153,public,confidence,self,Having Qanon parents while being a CSA survivor,4,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lqrqy5/having_qanon_parents_while_being_a_csa_survivor/,some_ads,7,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For me it’s been easier, I have lost some friends, but mostly friends who I used to know and I have now discovered what beliefs they really hold out in the public I guess. 

Fortunately for me, my wife and I are very much on the same page politically on most things, same for my current circle of friends. My family has a few conservatives in it but to the best of my knowledge have a healthy disdain for Trump and all this Q nonsense.

But as I read through here, I have seen so many stories about marriages ending in divorce, couples breaking up, parents disowning their children, children disowning their parents. It’s been really sad. And I realize how lucky I am.

It got me wondering though. Those of you who have had these nasty splits with people closer to you, people you love/d, was it Q? I was Q the final straw? Can this cult really take an otherwise kind and loving person and turn them into these twisted shadows of their former selves?

I must confess, I don’t know a lot about the psychology of cult, but I have been wondering if this many people could have all been this bad a judge of character? It seems to me now that many of the Q followers must have been other people once upon a time, kind people who loved and could be loved in return. 

I’m starting to wonder if my scorn for the bigotry and delusion the Q followers display should be tempered with more pity and sympathy? 

And if this is not who they were, it makes this so much more tragic. It goes from finding out who someone really is to what I can only imagine then feels like a bereavement, a genuine death of the former self.

It feels smart,  it feels like critical thinking, but as the saying goes ""It's easy to think everything is a conspiracy when you don't know how anything works."" 
 
It was a very basic understanding of computers that tipped me off that Q was a fraud. You won't run into many pilots who are flat earthers. You won't run into many (sadly a few) medical doctors who are anti vaccine. There's an old meme among ex Mormons that ex LDS members know significantly more about the history of the church than current members.  
  
There is also a huge amount of conspiracy thinking  based on mistrust in authority and experts. I once saw a pastor from NY preaching about flat earth, but he starts the whole sermon by asking his church to raise their hands if they think the government lies. They all agreed, and that's all he needed to convince them of his insane theory.

Over that timeframe, we have watched side by side as our parents become slowly eaten alive by QAnon. 

My situation is much more stable. My dad is an OG QAnon follower and proudly daunts his Q hat in public. We spoke in depth about Q, it’s history, and what it means to him over the holidays and I was shocked that it turned into a thoughtful conversation from both sides. It ended with my father saying the reason he follows QAnon is for the smallest offhand chance that it might be true outweighs what in reality is a somewhat boring truth.

My partner on the other hand has a much more severe situation. When I met his parents originally they struck me as a spitting image of my family- conservative but not lost on false statements. Once COVID hit, there was a drastic shift in their behavior and they dove in head first into QAnon. His entire extended family encourages them as well, buying bogus Christian based prophecy books with a literal quote I shit you not saying “if the chiefs win the Super Bowl it will be a symbol from Jesus that our commander Donald Trump is too a strong chief”. I found some of this literature while we were house sitting for his parents and I showed him. We flipped through the pages half laughing at these crazy statements. He dismissed it and we didn’t talk about it much after. The months after we’re filled his family picking fights with him and trying to shove their QAnon beliefs down my partners mouth (thankfully he resisted and still has).

Things finally hit a boiling point after the insurrection at the capital. His mother (who is always his worst bully) has been relentlessly targeting, belittling, and deliberately hurting my partner as her way to cope with the fact that QAnons beliefs are crumbling at her feet. Finally, my partner snapped last week and laid into his parents and their QAnon beliefs. They told him that he was brainwashed and by putting him into the public education system/college (he was homeschooled a large portion of his life) they have lost their son to the liberal media. Ultimately, this ended with them cut him off financially. He came home and apologized for not listening to me sooner about my concerns about their QAnon beliefs, but all I could do was apologize to him for how cruel and hurtful his family has been to him for the sake of QAnon.

I'd lost two great friends to QAnon and started to push away a few other friends that started speaking about Q. 

My first friend we will call A. We were best friends in high school and after, we basically were able to get away with typical teenager bs because my parents weren't strict but hers were. Her dad was a Vietnam vet, but never sought treatment and I believe he was abusive to her and her siblings. On June 28, 2017 (my wedding anniversary) her parents died when their home exploded and her youngest sister the only survivor. This is when I think she started to have lots of problems emotionally. She's married, has retired from the Air Force, has two sons and moves to a new state, but still comes back to our hometown to deal with insurance and fighting the company that sold her parents the faulty propane. Now fast track to current times, in I want to say July she started posting some Q on her Facebook and I had read it twice before reaching out ans asking what that was about. She went head first into saying her husband introduced it to her, that she's been watching all these child rape stories come out and basically not sleeping because she has to know how to protect her boys. Her words - you're a mother too, you need to know these signs. She sent me everything- From Behind the Shadows to John P and how he is the true rapist behind all these celebrities and how Tr*mp is going to save us. I watched with an open mind, found it all to be seriously ridiculous and I was afraid of where it was turning her jnto. I told her there is no way a man who has sexual assault charges coming from young kids is going to save us, and she said ""that's because those are false and won't hold up. Why do you think they've never gone through, because they're lying.""  She even told me how long her family won't be sheep and wear a mask because that also was fabricated to control us. She told me how her family in Colorado went to get tested, waited but left ans still got a call they were positive for Covid even though they never got tested. She was still going to send her kids to in school learning maskless and nothing was true about kids getting covid. I stopped poking around with these stories because honestly, I feel like these theories are enough to put someone in a mental hospital and seek treatment, they're making good people turn into crazed nightmares. Unfortunately, I had to stop because at the time we were served an eviction notice from my nmom and things were getting quite rough and she had sent me several videos while we house hunted and got upset with me that I told her I can't watch these anymore. She posted several on her Facebook ans Instagram accounts, and when she deleted those accounts, I blocked them. It still hurts because I truly loved this girl and have so many wonderful memories but she has lost her way and fully drank the Q Kool Aid. 

My other friend is P. I've known her since she and my sister were in elementary and she was also a bridesmaid in my wedding. She definitely would be the type to fall for Q because she followed every trend that she could get into. All summer long, she would post up to 10-15 things on social media A DAY (while having a toddler and becoming pregnant by her deadbeat boyfriend) and it was always hashtag save the children. So I muted her because I couldn't take her seriously, some things she posted would just be so false that even when she was called out for it she found a way to spin it into truth. After she had her second baby, she stopped posting the child abuse links and fell into the whole astrology and witchcraft postings, and how to cut out toxic family members. What made me finally cut her off was again the postings about Tr*mp saving us, that everyone is a child predator and she's warned us all. 

It's really sad that I chose to end these friendships, 20+ years, but these women fell so far into these QAnon lies and chose to only talk to people thst believes this. When I talked to A I tried so hard to get her to come out of this, how it's just people making up stories and rumors to ""cancel"" the celebs they're annoyed by.

She was all for it, until recently. Another one of my family members is in college, and when she graduates she is going to be a nurse, and she had the bright idea to tell someone who has cancer to not get the vaccine.  It still shocks me while typing it. 

I don’t know how much this is Q related, but I’m thinking it has something to do it. This family member is a huge Trump supporter, a lot of my family likes him but she’s extreme, and months back I remember her talking about the sex trafficking, and she also thinks Michelle Obama is a man (idk if that’s related to Q but it sounds like something they would say). She was planning on going to the capitol as well, but I forget why she didn’t end up going. She also said that COVID would go away once the election was over, again this is someone who is going to be a nurse. 

So now my family member is skeptical regarding on if she should get the vaccine or not, I think she’ll end up getting it, but it’s still scary to think about.

posted before about Q husband getting his gun license, and requiring me to sign off on it.

After I found out he got his license, I told our toddler that if he ever sees a real gun to make sure he never touches it and to call mom or dad.  He repeated this to his dad (I don't think there's anything wrong in telling a 4 year old that) and of course Qultist blows up at me telling me I'm putting fear into our kid about guns. Which I never did. Later our kid goes to bed and Qultist is talking to me about how he'll be safe with a gun, it will never be loaded in the house, etc.

I just tell him that I don't like when he talks about executing people (which is true), and he cuts me off and blows up at me telling me ""what do you think should happen to people who rape children?""...  and if I think he's going to go out killing people, I don't know him at all.  I never said I thought he was going out to kill people, I said that I don't feel comfortable with all the darkness he talks about and constantly talking about executing people.  He tells me I'm mental and that we are living in Communist China (we are Canadian). He also has to throw in, as long as people keep wearing masks, we will be a communist country.  He's standing up for our rights, and I'm just blind to everything.   I just told him to stop talking down to me.  He argues more that I don't support him and asks me what do I even care about? I need to stand up for what's right, and stand beside him because he's been doing this alone. He asks what I want, and I tell him to put his phone down for 1 day!!!  He says I never support him but I've put up with this sh!t for 4 years.  He says it's all at the precipice and then goes back to me not caring about babies being raped and killed... (excuuuuuuse me????)  at this point I just about had it.

He ask if I want him to stay or leave (we had a huge fight a few weeks ago where I told him I was done with his obsession) and I just tell him to 'GO'.  He changes into his QAnon shirt (HUGE EYEROLL) and as he's packing his bag to go stay with a friend, he tells me ""there's only so much a person can take until it's not worth it anymore"".... I mean, can you people believe this???  He's put up with me not caring about the Deep State and cabal and has had enough with me.   Of course, all this after I put my foot down and tell him to leave. I'm not going to have ANYONE tell me I don't care about babies being murdered. Disgusting. Pardon my french, but FUCK HIM!

The manipulation is real with this one.  I'm really sad my marriage is ended.  My first post here was a stark contrast from this one.  Now I'm somewhat relieved I won't have to listen to him rant about the Deep State MSM or cabal, or tyranny, communism, or ANY OF IT.  I feel like I can have my life back.  Tonight I'm going to sit here and watch a movie, whatever movie I want, without having to deal with his bullsh!t.  It's going to be a hard road ahead, but I already feel a weight lift.

I'm obviously super heated right now, but thank you for letting me rant.

Edit: he doesn’t have a firearm yet as I never signed off on his forms.  I was just preemptively talking to my toddler, in case a firearm came into our home (without my knowledge). I’m also NOT afraid of firearms, I just don’t think someone like him should have access to one (maybe before Q, but definitely not now).  A part of me feels like the ‘bad guy’ for not letting him have his guns, but I don’t want to be in the same house with him and firearms",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,137993,public,confidence,self,Kicked out my (stbx) Qhusband tonight...,15,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lqc3ik/kicked_out_my_stbx_qhusband_tonight/,some_ads,7,,,,,1614089708.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

QanonCasualties when there were fewer than 3,000 members, and now that number has swelled to fifty times that size, which is both personally comforting and tragic. I have read thousands of posts--now it is my turn to share.

One year ago today, I proposed to the woman that I loved. In the months following the engagement, our relationship fell apart, overwhelmingly due to Qanon. The unique aspect of our story is that my ex-fiancée never believed in Qanon. She is a wonderful person and she is as much of a victim in this story as I am. I can only hope that our story will be a cautionary tale for those experiencing similar situations and that those relationships can persist where ours did not.

Around six months prior to our engagement, I became aware that my ex fiancée’s mother was deeply involved in a movement called Qanon. I did not know much about the movement, other than that it believed in conspiracy theories that were totally illogical. That changed one night at dinner, when my then girlfriend’s mother told me about the cabal of satanic pedophiles that ran the world and would drink the blood of tortured children. With a straight face, she reeled off a dozen names and groups involved in this “Deep State,” and the overwhelming majority of these names were Jewish people and minorities (Soros, Rothschild, Rosenstein, Mossad, Oprah, Obama, etc.).

While I am not very religious, I am Jewish. I spoke out and said that these beliefs were untrue and were anti-Semitic in nature, as the Adrenochrome theory she espoused was almost identical to the rumors of Blood Libel that had existed against Jewish people for centuries. I implored her to find other news sources and to get out of her echo chamber, and at minimum, told her not to bring up these theories around me any further.

Over the following months, the stories continued. I told my girlfriend how much it bothered me, and she asked her mother to stop bringing the matters up in my presence, but to no avail. Finally, after our engagement and the outbreak of the Coronavirus, her mom crossed the line. Just before Easter, the mother spoke of “10 days of Darkness” that would be followed by the military round up of the cabal, which would be taken to Guantanamo Bay to be imprisoned and executed. The parallels of this “Storm” to the Nazi roundup of Jews was too much for me to stand. I looked to my fiancée and her sister and her father and asked them to say something against this hateful rhetoric, and the silence was deafening. In that moment, I felt abandoned, and it reminded me of a famous quote by Martin Luther King Jr., “In the end, we will not remember the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”

I spoke out forcefully and said how hateful and dangerous those beliefs were, and that I would not sit by and listen to lies and the demonization of groups of people, nor would I permit any children we may have in the future to be exposed to such sentiments. The following day, my fiancée’s father called her to revoke the blessing for our marriage, to say that if we did get married they would not attend the wedding, and to say that they would never forgive me. In essence, they gave my fiancée an ultimatum, her family or her fiancée.

While I feel a great deal of resentment towards my fiancée’s mother, the father is worse. The mom was a devout believer in Q and was seriously misguided--she needed help and I said as much. The father, however, was an Ivy League trained psychiatrist and a university professor, and he did not believe in Q—he simply wanted to ignore the problem. When I was no longer willing to listen silently to the hateful rhetoric, he sabotaged his daughter’s happiness to avoid confronting the real problem, that his wife was in a cult. Only a coward would sacrifice his daughter’s happiness to avoid hard truths, and this man is the epitome of a coward, whether my fiancée can see that or not.

For months, my fiancée and I tried to do couples therapy and counseling, but the Q parents made it clear that they would never change. My fiancée, out of loyalty and love for her parents, would not hold her parents accountable. Instead, she asked me to remain quiet and excuse myself if the parents brought up the topic again, and to do so for the rest of our lives. I told her that I would not sacrifice my morals and ethics, and that if they were unable or unwilling to change their behavior, she could have a relationship with her parents, but I would not. Ultimately, my fiancée said that she could not be with someone that did not have a relationship with her family, and I said that I could not be with someone that allowed her family to spread such hate and to knowingly treat me so disrespectfully.

I loved my ex and I am saddened every day by the loss of our relationship. It is a tragedy that our loving relationship fell apart. If anyone out there is in a situation where your partner or your family members are feeling alienated due to Qanon, please know that it is important to support the person that adheres to the truth. Truth matters. Morals matter. And it is important to speak up when you hear lies. Those that spread lies are guilty of transgressions, but those that know better and choose to stay silent are the ones that allow those lies to persist.

Life is full of hard choices, and for one reason or another, my ex made the decision to choose her family over me. She has cut off all communication and has likely convinced herself that she hates me or that I abandoned her, which is far from the truth. I held out hope until now that she would see the light, but our anniversary just passed without any message, so it is time for me to move on. One day, I hope she will recognize how much I loved her.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,137943,public,confidence,self,Time to Move On.,6,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lqadbu/time_to_move_on/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,

About 7 months after the very first Q post, he started diving head first into it ALL (aside from flat earth), and his entire world view shifted. He went from a very happy, healthy, outgoing, and loving man, to someone I barely recognized. At first I didn’t know why, because he didn’t share with me why he was spending more and more time at the computer scribbling on his notepad, nor why he was completely withdrawing from his friends/family/eventually me. Finally, when I was cleaning our apartment one day while he was at work, I happened across the notepad that was turned to a numbered page of “disturbing things happening around the world”. This included how the Holocaust was faked, and Hilary Clinton was a satanist pedophile, etc etc. I was shocked and more than a little scared, and a week later told him I was worried about him and that I thought we needed to take a break to focus on our respective mental health (I was beginning my journey through depression at the time). 

5 months of irregular contact later, he seemed to be making the progress I wanted and hoped to see: hanging out with his friends again, spending holidays with family, initiating contact with me again. I, of course, was happy for him, and we resumed our relationship. When I finally worked up the courage to ask him about “all the Q stuff” again, it turns out he had gone even deeper into it. I loved him enough that I tried to have reasoned arguments with him, but somehow he always made me feel stupid and I never made even the tiniest dent in his beliefs. Eventually I just stopped asking, and as time went on, he began slowly bringing these up around our friends and family. With my family, I would simply kick him under the table or shoot him a quick glare to tell him to shut up whenever he made comments that I knew were heading in that direction, but of course I couldn’t tell him what to say in front of his own. 

Fast forward several years to last spring, and I finally just had to stop talking about anything current events related/political/human rights/ANYTHING with him, because we ended up fighting and not speaking for the rest of the day. I was so tired and sad. I basically gave up on our relationship, but COVID and depression (not to mention how toxic our relationship felt by then) I didn’t feel able to leave. 

A month ago, he and I got into yet another argument, and we agreed that there was no point in continuing to be together. I still loved him, but knew that we just had fundamentally different beliefs and couldn’t agree on anything anymore.... As much as this pains me to write, I can’t express how freeing it has been. I’m able to express myself and my feelings about current events &amp; the world in general again. I’m able to talk openly with my friends and family about how crazy Qanon people are, where before I felt hypocritical doing so. I’m not nervous to see people anymore, because I no longer have to carefully navigate topics of conversation so that even the smallest thing won’t set him off. I no longer have to pretend that he isn’t racist/a conspiracy theorist. The other unhealthy aspects of our relationship aside, I can’t believe how long I ignored all the red flags of this mindset. 

This ended up being a lot longer than I intended, but also incredibly cathartic to share. I still don’t want to tell anyone in my life that he is a part of this movement, because I do still care about him and their opinions of him (and therefore me), but I’ve been following this sub basically since it started and thought I might share my experience. Not to say that all Q people are beyond saving, and I hope he is among that group, I just hope anyone who reads this knows that it is TOTALLY okay to prioritize yourself and remove people like my ex from your lives.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,137904,public,confidence,self,A month after my relationship with my Q boyfriend ended,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lq9l0b/a_month_after_my_relationship_with_my_q_boyfriend/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My backstory can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/iwvtv7/i_live_with_a_qanon_believing_mother_who_pushes/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/jn7sa3/december_21_2020_a_significant_day_for_quiltists/). She was radicalized primarily through YouTube videos. I [attempted to tweak her YouTube algorithm](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/kik5f2/looking_for_qdebunking_youtube_videos_to_alter/) so she'd get more animal videos and a fewer conspiracy related videos, but it hasn't been a very successful endeavor because it's been more difficult for me to get access to her YouTube account than I anticipated. Plus, she also actively searches for these videos so when I have managed to add dog videos to her watch history, it gets nuked pretty fast.  

Since YouTube began removing some of the more outrageous content she enjoyed and these content producers moved to other platforms, I anticipated that she might eventually try to find her favorites elsewhere. I did some research on how to best block these platforms on our home network and my solution was to buy a Raspberry Pi, install AdGuard Home, and use it as a DNS server. This allowed me to write custom filtering rules to block sites like Gab, Parler (when it's running), Rumble, and Bitchute at the network level without installing anything on her smartphone or desktop. It's also allowed me to keep track of some of the websites she visits and the content is worse than I thought. But I'm getting sidetracked...  

Thankfully, my mom isn't on social media. She doesn't have a Facebook, Twitter, Parler, or Gab account. She isn't tech-savvy enough to figure them out. However, she can navigate the YouTube app on her smartphone. Now that worst of the content has moved to Rumble and Bitchute, she has been made aware of these platforms by the Telegram groups she's joined.\*\*\* Obviously, she doesn't know that I've blocked these sites on our home network, nor does she know that she could turn off wifi on her smartphone and access those sites using mobile data. She asked me today if I could help her ""sign up"" for them. I tried to play it off and I managed to delay the discussion until later. However, I won't be able to postpone this indefinitely. You'd think I'd have thought of how to handle this eventuality when I started blocking these sites, but I haven't. I started blocking them in hopes she would eventually lose interest, but the Telegram groups have driven her deeper down the rabbit hole. I don't have a fully developed response and I was hoping to get some advice on how to handle this.

At this rate, I don't think telling her the truth is an option. A week after the January 6th insurrection, she asked me to help her forward an insane missive by a GOP official in upstate New York to a friend (I could be mistaken on the location), and I declined to do so. She immediately called me traitor to her and to the country, and told me I was censoring her. What ensured was one of the worst encounters we've have over Trump, QAnon, and these other conspiracies since Trump came down the elevator. It was bad and it lasted hours. I don't have the emotional energy to go through that again. The only way we've managed to maintain the peace is to not discuss politics and a significant amount of gray-rocking on my part.  So yeah, no telling her the truth. Perhaps I should just stop trying to limit the amount of disinformation she can access. At this point, it really seems pointless. 

Anyway, thanks in advance for any advice....

\*\*\* Sadly, AdGuard Home doesn't block the Telegram service. You can connect to the service via a proxy, so I thought about adding a proxy that goes nowhere. I don't know if that's even a real thing though, and all of this may be for naught anyways...

This is my first post here. I'm a reporter with an International station for the past 2 years and have been studying Q and all its people. Unfortunately, I also lost a very close friend of almost 10-years who is now one of the prominent Q-fluencers. 

In his latest video... he explains how Q and all these folks who ""research"" are not ""doing dates anymore."" Rather... he says ""in the next month."" -- They've realized that exact dates ruin their cause. 

Also, these Q-fluencers sicken me... taking innocent brainwashed people's money. Thank goodness YouTube has demonetized many of these folk's accounts, but you can see in this roughly 18-minute video, he literally mentions his PayPal every 90 seconds. 

Sad this guy used to be one of my closest friends. I'm going to start doing YouTube videos for folks who want the latest info on what these Q-folks are saying and what I'm finding out in my investigations. You can follow me at [youtube.com/faranbalanced](https://youtube.com/faranbalanced)

I’ve been friends with him my entire life. We’re both 22 and met when we were babies at his moms daycare. Our friendship growing up was great, although we went to different high schools, we still hung out often and enjoyed each others company. He was always “the weird kid” but never in a malicious way, he was just a strange guy in general. Growing up and for the majority of high school he was just a funny, goofy dude who was always fun to be around and a loyal friend. 

Things started to change around 2016 if I’m remembering right. Throughout high school and to this day I have several different friend groups and a wide array of friends from different walks of life. I’m friends with self described radial leftists and the friend in question who I would describe as a religious fundamentalist conspiracy theorist. In high school he got much closer to his own small friend group which consisted of very socially awkward gamer dudes who exhibited a lot of sexist and homophobic behaviour, but to be honest nothing out of the norm for high school boys. I was also friends with these guys but as time went on I only remained friends with N mostly because of our childhood bond. 

Just to clarify I don’t want this post to become political, I’m genuinely looking for unbiased advice here, but I do have to make note of our political differences and how they’ve impacted our friendship. 

Around 2016 when Trump got elected he started sharing conspiracy theories with myself and our friend group at the time. It started with offhand comments and eventually became him just constantly bombarding us with conspiracies which lead to constant arguments. His relationship with some of that friend group slowly dissipated with time but even with our disagreements and arguing we remained friends. 

Things started to get even worse around two years ago when he slowly turned into a fundamentalist Christian seemingly out of nowhere. (He claims he’s always been Christian but never mentioned it before 2018ish) He became super judgmental of myself and all our friends for not aligning with his personal values. “Gay jokes” that seemed innocent enough in high school became genuine homophobia that LGBT friends of ours have told me is the reason they’re no longer friends with him. Saying the N word in high school (he is white) turned into genuine racist tendencies and to this day in 2021 he uses the N word with a hard R constantly, even though he’s been told it’s not ok by everyone around him. I could go on but to keep it as short as I can he has slowly changed from a goofy, weird, but fun guy into a racist, sexist, homophobic, and generally unpleasant person to be around. The last straw for me recently was hearing from his sister boyfriend that his dad had been exposed to covid at work and while the rest of his family was quarantining he was still inviting friends over secretly and potentially exposing his family to covid. He is also an anti vaxxer which is going to be a big problem for me when the vaccine eventually rolls out.

What made me start writing this is after me begging him to stop sending conspiracy theories, he sent an especially stupid one to a group chat, I told him to stop sending them and that it’s insane to believe it, and he blocked me on all social media. By and large despite our differences he has been a good friend to me. He’s been there for me during very hard times and I have been very mean to him a lot of times in the past mostly due to our differences and handled situations wrong plenty of times. He’s helped me move a million times, driven me everywhere cause I don’t drive and helped out my mother with chores cause he lives in the same town as her and I do not. It hurts to say but I’m very much considering cutting him off until (or if) he changes. I just need advice because I’m very conflicted and hurt right now.

The sheer number of theories that seemed to conveniently explain pretty much anything they wanted to believe (i.e. coronavirus being a hoax, global warming not being real, the Jewish deep state) and 2. The number of people who believed in Q-related theories who also did not actually know about Q/4chan/Qanon/The Storm at all. I found it interesting that I could talk to my relatives, who did not know about Qanon and have never been on or heard of any of the Q drops spout out beliefs that were clearly started in Qanon message board sites. Additionally, I was struck by how every single thing that Qanons saw as negative was connected to the Deep State Conspiracy, and posters who were not Q just sorta posted theories that strangers on the internet just believed.

Functionally, I get how it’s happening. The theory starts on Q message boards and gains traction, then gets picked up by conservative “news sources” on Facebook which omits the Q-origin of the article and rebrand it as news. So now, even my 78 year old Aunt would repost a fully Q-conspiracy theory on Facebook without knowing it came from Qanon. I think it has infiltrated the Republican party so handily that way. 

Another thing was the impossibility that people actually cared about the victims of the cabal, who apparently are children. Because if you truly cared and believed that a secret cabal was eating children then why the hell would you “Trust the plan,” and “Hold the line,” and just watch inane YouTube videos for proof of the conspiracy? The people who follow these theories appear to want to believe one thing: **That Donald Trump is the right, and should/will be president for another 4+ years or forever**. They will think anything to justify this belief, even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

This is just a natural progression of a ""party"" that lost its moral compass a long time ago. Many Republicans have been primed to believe conspiracies for decades and that this is nothing new for the GOP. This is not to say the Democratic Party is perfect, certainly it is not, and there have been morally bankrupt politicians on both sides (which I am sure Q people WILL LET YOU KNOW).

I am sure that anyone interested in this topic is interested in cognitive dissonance and moving the goal posts so I will not go over it again. But, remember that these are important in understanding the GOP today.

First, a brief history of the GOP since the 1960’s is important (and I would recommend, It Was All a Lie by Stuart Stevens and It’s Even Worst than it Looks by Ornstein and Mann and Why the Right Went Wrong by EJ Dionne Jr).

Basically, since Barry Goldwater’s campaign (and the Civil Rights movement), the GOP has just not attracted Black voters. Why? **Because Black voters tend to understand how to vote in their self-interest**. And in the 60s, during the Civil Rights movement, the interests of Black voters were pretty obvious. The Republican Party, particularly Goldwater, had started preaching for States’ rights and a small government when, for instance, 20,000 National Guard members had to be sent to the University of Alabama for it to be safe for Black students.

Instead of attempting to win back Black voters, the Republican Party targeted working class white voters, particularly in the South. This was especially evident in the campaign of Barry Goldwater, who campaigned on a platform of individualism and anti-Communism. He won the nomination, but lost the election by a landslide, but managed to flip five southern states red with his stance against federal enforcement of the Civil Rights Act. Since the 1960’s the South has been overwhelmingly red. 

The GOP then made an effort to target “working class” white voters, preferably very religious and without a college education. In the 1980’s and 1990’s, especially with Reagan, the party targeted Evangelical Christians, with dogmatic hardlines against LGBTQ rights and abortion. But Evangelical Christians were not made republican through Roe v. Wade or a particular culture war...This is a fallacy of our modern times. It was a case called Green v. Conolly, which held that segregated Christian schools (such as Jerry Falwell's) could not have tax exempt status because by default, discriminatory schools, by definition, were not charitable organizations. It is a holding that makes a lot of sense, but made racist Evangelicals very angry and involved them in politics**. Evangelical organizations started up with nationalistic views and got involved in politics under the guise of being against secular culture. This was not because culture got too sexual, but because it got too integrated.** 

But then, something very curious happened. Evangelicals and Republicans at large voted for Reagan, a divorced California actor, over Jimmy Carter, a Sunday school teacher who read the Bible daily. This makes evangelical support for Trump unsurprising to say the least. People think Pence swayed evangelicals and I am sure they did not. 

The Reagan era was situated on flimsy economic theories and odd anecdotes. The oddest one being ""The Welfare Queen."" The Welfare Queen was a real person, named Linda Taylor. Taylor was a career criminal, kidnapper, and likely a murderer who was racially ambiguous and mostly white-passing. But Reagan described her in coded language ""a woman from the southside of Chicago"" who stole $150,000 in welfare. In reality, she stole $40,000 from welfare fraud but was only charged with $8,000. People assumed she was a Black woman, and she was, but she was able to impersonate Hispanic, Jewish, and Asian women in her schemes. Reagan, instead of framing this as a wacky one-off story (which it was) implied it was an example of a systemic problem.

\*Another more recent anecdote has been the Kate Steinle case, which Trump mentioned, which mirrors the ""Welfare Queen"" Reagan stuff. A five-time-deportee, a Mexican man, shot and killed a white woman in San Francisco, which was a sanctuary city. The perpetrator,  José Inez García Zárate, was found not guilty of murder because he literally picked up a gun he found and shot it. He was also found to be a paranoid schizophrenic and a vagrant who was frequently in trouble with the law. Why was he so hard to deport permanently? Well, he did not stay anywhere permanently and had few, if any, associates or family. Zarate was not a typical Mexican, not a typical migrant, and by definition of being severely mentally ill not a typical person. But that never reached the ears of Trump supporters who think that a liberal California jury insanely decided not to charge this man with murder, and that this was apparently endemic of a larger problem. It is not. 

Conservative strategy really ramped up with Newt Gingrich who started this whole ""win at all costs"" strategy. Gingrich, a very sorely mentally disturbed individual decided that winning was the new Republican strategy in congress. McConnell has followed this lead into today. But...that's not even the point. ***The point is that voting Republican is essentially voting for an opposition party.*** Like baseball fans that just want the Yankees to lose, the Republican party would grasp at anything to defeat Democrats. Unfortunately the ""Yankees"" in this case are a properly funded federal government. What you get when your platform is loosely ""small government"" is ""shitty government."" And that's what we have now. 

And this includes distorted facts about climate change, social issues, COVID, etc. People are groomed into these beliefs for a variety of reasons. But the thing is that they have been groomed for many years. And communities have been groomed. So, if you have been denying climate change for your entire life, with the mounting evidence and support for it from, well, the entire World, it is easier to believe that the World has some messed up deep state. **But even larger than that, if you are voting in such a way that necessarily goes against your own interests, then that creates a psychological (see cognitive dissonance theory) need for mental gymnastics, false justifications, and ""alternative facts"" .** And people have been doing mental gymnastics in regard to politics since the 60s. It doesn't matter if your Q person became a republican yesterday, the fact is that we have just accepted this as a fact of American life in both parties. 

All Americans are told to ""reach across the aisle,"" to ""consider other people's opinions."" This is a form of gaslighting. Have you had a feeling that the Republican party was ""racisty"" and nonsensical for a while? (Because it is.) But then, even people on the left are telling you to compromise? I think most people have. Being on the left  means you have been intensely gaslighted into thinking you are on some sort of equal playing field with a loose political strategy to win/get money. 

Think about abortion. If a person really considered it a genocide of babies, if you really thought it was murder, a violent act, then why involve your own young children in it, as many anti-choice people do? If you thought it was *murder* why sit outside abortion clinics essentially doing nothing? Because human beings have a gut instinct about what murder is and what isn't, and it simply doesn't hit us because we know it's not murder. I know there are a few nutjobs but the vast majority of anti-choice people out there say it's murder, compare it to the Holocaust, and then go about your lives living normally with this massecre apparently going on. So, youre saying if you believed the HOLOCAUST were happening you'd just sit around reposting Facebook articles? 

It's the same thing with Qanon. If you think the deep state were killing children, why would you just sit around on the computer? Why do nothing? Why ""Hold the line""? Why ""Trust the plan""? Because they have been groomed to deal with ""outrage"" this way. Because of predatory politics. Because of an opposition party that has taken over half the country. Because if you admit this is wrong, then you would admit that you have been wrong, your parents were wrong, etc. Qanon did not just ""start"" three years ago. It's been baking in the Republican oven for decades, which is why it won't just go away. The trouble for me is that it's becoming increasingly enmeshed. 

The best thing to do? Not sure. People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to double down when presented with facts. So your loved one will not just see the ""light of day"" by you telling them the facts. Truthfully, **I think the best course of action is to cut off contact until you feel psychologically safe around your Q person.** Do I love my Dad? Yes. Are we good having a conversation right now without me wanting to punch a wall? No. Hell no. 

**Tl; dr Most Q's have been groomed for their entire lifetime for this, because most Americans have been groomed for half a century into thinking the Republican Party is reasonable or stands for anything other than defunding the government where it wants to.

It was very uncomfortable and even devastating for me to see the things she said and posted last year because she seemed brainwashed and like she’d passed the point of no return. Because it was too hard for me, and I determined I wouldn’t be friends with someone like that if they weren’t my family, I treated her the same way as I would non-family and removed her from my friends list in December. 

She had created a new account (which we were previously friends on) but evidently when she saw me pop up as a suggested FB friend, she thought she had simply forgotten to add me on her new account, so she messaged me about that and sent a friend request. Thinking/hoping that maybe she became one of the people who turned a new leaf once “the storm” didn’t happen on 1/6, I figured I would accept her request and check out her page. Her page is set to private, so I couldn’t check in advance to see if she has still been posting about Q things. I accepted it, went to her page, and immediately regretted the decision. Nothing changed. 

I want to respond to her “add meeeee!! :)))))))” message and say the real reason why we weren’t friends on FB, mainly because so long as she doesn’t know I have such a problem with it, she’ll continue to interact with me as though everything is normal, and there is just no way I’m going to be able to look past that giant of an elephant in the room.

It started with COVID is a hoax, it’s a ploy from big pharma to make money, and so on. Now, it seems that the rhetoric he is spouting is deeply crossed with the Q bs I’ve seen. He is talking about how the PCR test is fake, all of the science is biased and then sends me videos (which always get taken down, OR they ask for your personal info or money in order to see them...like how is that not obvious?) and says “you see, here is proof.” 

It’s even more painful because I am a scientist. I’m a preventative medicine phd candidate. My life is dedicated to research...And he won’t believe me. He says everything I’m learning is fake. And that even my studies have been falsely guided (like even results somehow?) by higher powers. It makes no sense. 

When he brings me something easily debunkable, and I show him that eg RNA doesn’t work like that or whatever, he just says, “it’s too bad that they’re not teaching you the reality.” And gives me a sad look. This is incredibly frustrating. It’s like if I said, the sky is blue, it’s known to be blue, it’s demonstrably blue, but he says no, it’s not, it’s red. Like how can I give him info if he won’t even accept basic info as correct?

So with him being at this level of non acceptance, is there any way to save him? I don’t think he realizes this anti science is Q territory. He used to hate trump but now I don’t even know. I don’t want to ask. With the 2016 election he was so upset when Bernie lost, he said he would rather vote trump than Clinton, if that is an indicator. 

Is it too late? Or has he already been programmed? Others have already tried and he just gets on an hour long rant about the “truth.”  He berated our mom for getting her covid vaccine. He has yelled at our family members (who are mostly in the health care industry) for spreading fake news about covid and helping big pharma. This is insulting to them, because they’re exhausted already from working in an environment that has been so hard hit by covid.

I feel so isolated from my family. Some more than others. It's like they've all drunk the koolaid and it makes me feel like I'm the crazy one.

It's either Qanon, pyramid schemes, flat earth, anti-vax, or all of the above. Just getting worse and worse. I can't have any normal conversations with them.

I think it's their way of dealing with trauma and personal failure. Makes them feel like it's not actually their own fault for the situation they're in.

Thankfully I have a good support network in my friends and co-workers. My wife sees what they're doing too so no problems at home. 

I just wish they could be normal. I want to talk about science, and space, and climate change, and making things better ffs! Not hear about how, ""oh just wait, something's happening"". It's all so backwards. I have to not think about them much because it makes me angry.

I feel like my heart and spirit are completely broken. I am so thankful that I found this thread - it makes me feel like I am not alone in this. 

Ever since last March, when covid really hit, my mother has been transforming. To be honest I am not sure if she considers herself a part of Q, but she holds all of their beliefs. We have had countless arguments where I am literally begging her to just stop talking about it. She believes she is “awakened” and the rest of us (the family) are still sleeping. I am so exhausted of trying to nudge her back to reality. She believes in the great awakening, Trump is here to save us, you cannot watch/trust ANY news channel (all fake news), the Clinton’s/Obama’s/Biden’s are evil beings (not even human) Tom Hanks and most of Hollywood are part of the pedo ring, covid is not real (she refuses to wear a mask), among much more.

She tells me I cannot face the truth of what is happening in the world. She cannot be reasoned with and is always telling me to “do my research” when I try to use facts or logic to prove her wrong. It is so, so frustrating and depressing. 

Despise me asking her many, many times to just not discuss it, she simply cannot help it. This has led me to the difficult decision to take a step back and not speak to her until I feel I am ready. This makes me feel guilty and also the fact that my brothers are telling me to just “make up with her and move on”. When she goes on her rants, they just listen and agree to avoid any type of conflict. To me, this is what made her so bad. I don’t want to do that anymore, and maybe it is wrong, but I can’t take it. It’s hard to have a relationship with her and it’s also hard not to. This is so difficult and I’m just so angry that it has come to this.

As some of you may know if you've read previous posts of mine, I've lost folks to Q and I do sexual violence prevention and support work. I've been personally digging into street epistemology and other deprogramming techniques and professionally digging into combating misinformation in the sexual violence field. Someone shared the webinar below with me and the other links are from the webinar. 

I figured this info could be helpful for folks if they have QPeople who focus on the trafficking portion and if they're not too far down the rabbit hole. (I think the webinar itself is interesting but I wouldn't necessarily share it with any Qpeople).

Hope this helps.

I knew I wasn't alone. but still. seeing others and reading other's experiences helps. It's my parents (in their 80s). Both trumpers, they have been republican for as long as I can remember. And really, once I left home I gave it little thought. I knew we had some fundamental differences about what we think but that divide has gotten wider. I used to feel like I was a middle of the road sort of person, could see valid points on both sides, all that. But through the years I've leaned further and further to the left. Though my Dad will still say that 'Once I'm older I'll be a republican'. My reply is 'Dad, I'm in my 40s. I think you should let that go now'.

Several years ago, I had to move back home. I had lost my apartment through a nasty breakup, and had decided to go back to school. It was hard to move back in my 30s, but ultimately it was helpful. I could work part time, and at some point just do school full time and get myself on a better life track. I was living there during the 2016 election. Fox news on every TV in the house, rush limbaugh on the radio in the AM. I kept most of my opinions to myself, and made it a point to educate my son about critical thinking and that you have to do the research, you can't believe everything on TV, especially on a channel that is all opinions. It's not news then. I rooted for the Democrats, they rooted for the republicans. I told them that trump's build the wall was racist, and that racism is wrong. That his attitude about women was disgusting and no one should support that. Dad felt emboldened at the grocery store to comment loudly about Latinex people and their children. When confronted he said ""I'm too old to change"" I said that was BS and a copout.  In the end the emotional abuse that I grew up with began to spill over to my son when Mom told me she was withholding affection from him till he cleaned his room. Then backpaddled and tried to deny it when I told her she was being emotionally abusive to her grandson. I moved him out and to his Dad's place that weekend. I stayed. for a while. I tried to reason, use logic, get mad, argue and finally I gave up and I left. I lived at a friends place, rented space in her living room. Just to get away from the endless barrage of bs.

I thank my lucky stars that Mom never figured out how to use Facebook. She had asked me to set one up for her, I told her no, if she wanted one she had to figure it out herself. Mostly because they treat me as their built in tech support, I'm not going to sign up for FB support too. But she did find NewsMax, she said ""I like what they say better than Fox, something is wrong with Fox"" (this was around the time that Fox was criticizing trump) I would tell her that you are not supposed to like what you hear in the news, it's news, not a fantasy story. Also around that time she would call me, and for an hour she would talk about the Dems manipulating things and making things up about trump. I would disagree. try to fact check her, but the amount of lies were overwhelming and it's hard to do it in real time. I finally made a rule with her, a boundary that I no longer wanted to talk about politics, religion or my weight. To say in short, Mom is not good at respecting boundaries. I would steer the convo back to safe topics, but she always had to get her jab in. Tell me to not 'fall for the spin' I had friends participating in the BLM protests. Getting pepper sprayed for standing and holding signs. I watched the live streams and heard their stories. But to her they were all Antifa terrorists. I told her that all that they are trying to do, is stop the inequalities. Bring attention to an issue that is very real. But it does not fit into her narrative, therefore, I am the one that has been mislead. I'm believing the lies. 

Then I decided that I would only Email with her, no more calls. No more visits. It was too much for me to handle. I started going to therapy. Watching her go down this rabbit hole, believing everything that trump would say. Her emails also got hostile and cold. she would not respond for days and days when I had said something she didn't like or something that rubbed her the wrong way.. punishing me.  I made it clear. You don't have to write me long letters, but I need to know you are okay, I have power of attorney and I need to know that you are both safe and staying healthy. Mom is more worried about Covid, I got to her early and told her to listen to Fauci, listen to the CDC. Dad, not such a big believer, will wear a mask but thinks it's all overblown. 

I refuse to talk with them about what happened at the capitol. The only thing that has been said was after the election, after the insurgency, Mom telling me she is worried about what is happening in the country. Worried about what is going to happen. I agreed, and backed it up with telling her that there are a lot of extremists and that they should be held accountable for their actions, particularly considering what they did at the capitol. I don't think we were talking about the same groups of people. 

So is it Q..? I'm not sure, I've lost the people I once knew and loved. Their limited knowledge of the internet seems to have played in my favor here, I think. But Mom had not been sharing things with me from her Email for a long time, so I worry that she could be in deeper than I realize. I do know they are not the parents I once knew, not anymore. Not for quite a while now. It used to really bother me, now I feel mostly numb with moments of intense emotion about it. I'm just glad to see that I'm not alone.

I'm unafraid to tell it like it is so after walking on eggshells for months, trying to reason with him, sending him correct and truthful information he wouldn't even look at or read and getting nothing but very mean and ugly reactions, I resorted to dropping one word TRUTH BOMBS.   I'd just say, Dump Trump or Drop the cult meaning Qanon.   Now my son also has cancer and is undergoing chemo and radiation, I stopped mentioning anything other than his health.  Doctors say he will have a full recovery.   I am not so lucky.

saw the video.

In most instances of relationships where domestic violence or mental abuse occurs, one of the first things that the abuser does is cut the victim off from family and friends so they don’t have a support system and so that the only truth can come from the abuser. 

I have to think that this is the reason behind Trump’s “fake news” and derision of the MSM campaign. Basically, I believe it was designed to alienate people from sources of news that were reliable. Once they had that void opened up, they had to fill it with something. And unfortunately, with a little nudging from Trump and Fox News, this is the rabbit hole they ran down.

One of my parents is the worst offender. We've had some pretty horrible arguments about their beliefs, spreading of misinformation and absolutely terrifying me with the ideas they have embraced.

I recently had to go home for a family emergency and spent almost a month being exposed to daily rants and pontifications over the theories my parent thinks are fact. They claim Fox News is watered down nonsense yet it ran, at volume, all day, every day. My parent would sit glued to their phone and laptop, wearing headphones and fixating on videos and forum threads/posts. There were times over my time there that I was clenching my teeth so hard to keep from screaming that my jaw would ache at night when I would finally try to sleep. In less than a week I was dealing with daily headaches, stomach upset and mentally felt like I was teetering right the edge of throwing a full on rage filled fit complete with visions of smashing furniture.

The worst recent topic is the Covid-19 vaccination and how members of my family truly, honestly, deeply believe that the vaccine is made up of literally ground up aborted babies. And, if you receive the vaccine you are not only injecting pure satanic death into your body, it is again all a hoax to hoodwink people into getting injected with tracking devices. No amount of showing proof on any level penetrates their barrier of brainwashing, believe me I tried.

Other long winded tirades in my time there were about the insurrection in DC (Fake, that was Antifa) and how the people that died were paid crisis actors. Also, as Americans it is our *right* to storm federal buildings and demand the the evil satanic cabal running this country be called to account, violently, if need be, people are sheep!

Holy freaking hell, I thought it was bad before, it is now so much worse. Especially since everyone in my family who had gone off into the Q weeds found themselves banned from Twitter, dislocated when Parler went away and now can't seem to get Gab to work with any amount of reliability. I have no idea where they were spending their days shouting into the void, but somehow they are still finding places to receive and share this incredible amount of misinformation. 

I have tried to hard to be optimistic about this running its course with them but I honestly don't see it happening. The hooks of this madness are sunk deep and even if whoever was or is behind Q is no longer posting, this thing has self-sustaining momentum now. I have to come to terms with the fact that I have lost them, they aren't coming back and even when they seem ""normal"" in conversations the crazy is just right there under the surface waiting to spring out and ruin everything. And they don't care because they think they are right. The internet/Q/YouTube/Random crazy a$$hole online said so, it's a fact and the MSM is wrong/evil/satanic/controlling our minds.

My mother in law on a weekly basis argues with her sister over the phone about all these conspiracies. Me and my partner dont talk to her about these as our mental health isn't the best. 1 mention of the world ending by someone you used to look up to can even send us over the edge. 

The most recent arguement we heard was how Biden is apparently hated by everyone in the Senate. That they are looking for ways to get him out of office and reintroduce trump. I'm sorry but when the fuck would democrats or Republicans kick out their president and say ""let's get the other party leader in charge again"" as if there isn't a distinct difference on how they view and run the country.

I think we’re safe from the Trump worship now, although he used to like him. My brother also totes similar views, but I’m not as confident either of them believes the election was valid, just that Biden didn’t steal it.

August of 2020 is the beginning of the time I can actually track with text messages, phone calls and emails. Things looked idyllic. We were finally communicating in a non-toxic way. It was all ""I understand and I love you"" and streams of loving emojis. We talked about how happy we were that we were muddling through figuring out what a relationship between the two of us was like with me being an adult now. She told me how proud she was of me, I told her I really appreciated her understanding while I was figuring things out.

In October she watched Plandemic and wanted me to watch as well. I warned her against it, that it has been throughly debunked. She claimed the scientists behind it were well respected and world renowned. I told her that wasn't true, but I would watch it and get back to her. I couldn't get through the first 20 mins, and I didn't know how to say that. She didn't ask.

Over the next couple months she would send me weird/random text messages with no explaination. When I asked her what they were she would say ""Oh, I just thought it was interesting."" Shit like that Fauci was Mother Teresa's secret son, but Mother Teresa was really a man who was a pedophile. Bill Gates is putting microchips in the covid vaccines and it's the number of the beast.

Every time I would try to appear open minded and non-judgemental. I'd ask her what she thought of that and why she felt it was true. ""It's interesting."" Is all I got back.

December rolls around and it starts getting weirder. She texted this weird bit of disjointed text that makes no sense to me, my Fiance and his parents that was talking about how the Covid body count is not only fabricated, but because QAnon people are requiring ""actual proof"", it's coming out that ""they're"" ""actually murdering"" people to make their ""covid quotas"". She sent me more stupid videos that were obviously bunk, and I sat down in front of them ready to puzzle and write it out. Within 3 minutes there was TOO MANY LIES for me to keep going. I couldn't fathom trying to debunk 90 mins of this. I was overwhelmed. I was secure in what she had told me about us being patient with each other and valuing our relationship.

I made a really dumb mistake. I didn't know how serious it was. She's never been into politics my whole life. She hates technology like smart phones and calls herself a ""techy rebel"" because she knows so little about social media and computers. I thought she was safe. 

I started ignoring the stuff she was sending me and asking for ""my opinion"". There were a couple things she sent I knew were bunk and told her so, but instead of all that about respecting and wanting my opinion, she got mad.

When we spoke before Christmas, she made it clear she didn't think Covid was a real thing anymore. All I could think of was continuing to diffuse the situation and not ruining her holiday.

Shortly after that she ""randomly"" blew up at me about how I was ungrateful. A few days after that, same thing. I didn't make the connection then, but she had sent me QShit, and I had just carried on ignoring it. A few days after this she looses her mind at me over the fact that if she wants me to forgive her, and her flying monkey, they need to apologize, and uninvites me from her upcoming wedding because I'm ""being disrespectful"" and I'm not ""acting right"".

About a week after that I reach out again asking about the wedding, being positive and upbeat. I get back 5 pictures QDrops and news articles she'd really horribly screenshot with no explaination, 2 of her in her wedding dress, and the message ""excited for the wedding"". Within 5 texts she decides that I'm not acting right and snaps at me. I respond with boundaries, and she looses her mind and ""leaves"". So in her mind we're not talking because she's punishing me, but in reality, I'm done. This Q shit + her usual abusive, narcissistic, selfish, bullshit is too much for fucking anyone.

She blocked me on FB ages ago, but I made a new account to look and QShit is EVERYWHERE on her FB staring early December. I didn't understand so many times why she was so upset when we would talk, but it lines up with when she would send me this Qcrap and I'd ignore it. I had said I'd watch whatever, and I would, but she expected immediate results, and would guilt trip me when I hadn't watched whatever she'd asked after 6 hrs, so I wasn't interested anymore.

By the time I finally realized, (late Dec) I would say it was too late if she hadn't continued responded to my sound debunking of her BS with ""I just thought it was interesting, no big deal."" It had been too late and I missed it.

I'm sorry if this is disjointed or all over the place, I'm still figuring things out. I'm sure this all makes it sound and look obvious, but I can't stress how much it wasn't at the time. I just don't know how I missed it. I hope this helps anyone.

I am happy to find this but now think I could turn into my husband with my head in my phone except over the opposite side of Q beliefs. Essentially my 3 teens would now be losing both their parents over 2 different sides of the same issue. Does anyone else feel that way?
I feel sick &amp; sad over this and don't think I am up to the challenge of learning about how to interact with someone taken over by these beliefs and bringing him back from the dark side. What are the stats on this being successful?
I had separated from him a few years back due to it not being a healthy relationship. But I came back home after 1.5 years away, as my heart broke watching my kids traipse back and forth between 2 ""homes"", then 1.5 years later covid hits and now my husband has gone off the deep end. I have a counselor but maybe need someone who specializes in conspiracy theories. 
I almost think I have to ignore this side of him; he gets that I don't like his beliefs (nor does he like my mainstream beliefs). I told him the other night we can't talk about this stuff and remain married and he said then we won't stay married! He said he would leave as I told him that I don't have it in me to move out again.

 The official announcement of martial law and a legitimate military government, in effect since 12:00 AM on January 20, 2021, was made on Friday, January 29 at 6:00 PM EST (11:00 PM GMT).

 The official announcement of Biden's arrest along with 355 congressmen and 109 senators (464 elected) on January 24 and 25 was made on Sunday, January 31 at 4:35 PM EST (10:35 PM GMT - 11:35 PM Amsterdam / Brussels  / Paris).

 These announcements were made on the dates and hours above to all American media (televisions, radios and national newspapers) and to all world news outlets.

 As expected by the legitimate military government that runs America, as well as Trump and Qforce, this information was 100% censored by all official world media. The US military government knew this and wanted it that way.

 As with Biden and his party's coup d'état, the legitimate US government is allowing the US media to commit widespread treason by having them censor the legitimate government's official statements about measures of national security and immediate danger to the American nation.

 The media have all fallen into a trap. Now the legitimate military government can take over (provisional) control of all such media as dictated by law and the US Constitution. 🇺🇸”

He treated me well, but always kept something hidden. He is a divorced man in his early 40's, with two children (a girl and a boy). His ex-wife was less than stable, threatening me, harassing me, and generally making his life miserable. I thought his constant state of anxiety and agitation came from constantly watching his back with her because she would show up at his job, or drunk at his house at all hours (I witnessed this on several occasions). She eventually got convicted of Drunk and Disorderly Conduct, as well as Trespassing, for breaking into a man's house that she dated after he chose to end their extremely casual relationship. 

It wasn't until a few months in that I got a peek into his worldview. First, it started with the firm belief that the US never made it to the moon. Not exactly stuff to seriously worry about, because lots of people who don't hold horrible beliefs think that. It's not something worth arguing over. I dismissed it. It got worse from there. He kept telling me that I was blind to what really happens in government, in law, and in society. He was an ardent listener of Alex Jones and other conspiracy websites, purchased their products, and tried to purchase them for me. He railed against anyone or anything that challenged his ""correct"" worldview. He started following Q very closely. 

One day, he told me that people born on US soil are not automatic citizens. This was the first time I realized that he was serious about these theories and his beliefs. I opened a copy (one of many) of the Constitution that he kept handy and pointed out that the 14th Amendment defines citizenship as any person born in the United States. It's in plain text and was ratified in 1868, He told me I didn't understand the Constitution correctly. 

I graduated from law school, passed two different state bars on the first try, and practiced as a criminal lawyer. I know the 14th Amendment well. I am not, and was not, wrong. He used to praise me for my intelligence, except for when it came to matters of law. He didn't go to law school, he didn't practice law, and he isn't in any way an expert at anything. He chose instead to listen to Alex Jones, then Q, and other conspiracy proprietors. Soon, it moved on to questioning my every belief, bullying me when I disagreed, and telling me that I did not love my country or its citizens if I disagreed. He denied that the Proud Boys existed, and when challenged, just stated that they were true patriots fighting for the original Constitutional ideals. 

He berated me about Pizzagate (seriously messed up), the New World Order, and every other piece of crazy that came along. It got so bad that I actually asked him if he thought the world was flat. I got him into counseling, thinking that something had to shake loose. It didn't.  At this point, I already knew I wanted to end things, but he'd had major surgery and I was waiting a month for him to heal enough. He ended things before that. I gladly walked out and counted my blessings that I wasn't married to him. 

Two weeks later, he contacted me. He wanted all the parts of a relationship but to ignore our political differences. I calmly explained that his definition of a relationship is not what I want, need, or deserve. I tried being his friend. He got upset that I refused physical contact. I informed him that I am not willing to be his booty call. 

Then January 6th happened. He called me on January 7th to let me know that it was BLM and Antifa that stormed the Capital. I pushed back and told him Alex Jones was there, and of the hundreds of hours of footage of that horrible day, nobody once claimed to be a ""crisis actor' or part of anything but a supporter of the 45th President. He said again that I was blind, stupid, and I didn't know anything.

That was the last day I talked to him. I chose instead to walk away from the insanity, to save myself, and to stop trying to change someone who didn't want to change. I feel so badly for his two kids, who don't have a single stable parent. I'll regret forever that I could not help them, but saving myself became much more important. I couldn't write off the beliefs anymore as ""quirks"" or misunderstandings. 

I'm not here for praise, pity, or for any other reason than to tell you that the article in the Daily Dot made me feel seen and heard in a way I'd never felt about this subject. For all of you out there who are on the fence about leaving, have a go plan, tell your trusted group, and get out. They aren't going to change. They aren't coming back. They actively chose every single day to ignore all the counter-evidence and cling to a belief system not reflected in reality. 

It's like the airline instructions go, put the oxygen mask on yourself first, then on those around you. Protect your children, they are important, but in order to do that, you must protect yourself first. You do not deserve to spend your life justifying your belief that they are wrong. They certainly don't spend an ounce of time worrying about whether or not they are. Having to answer continuously for the new and bizarre theories they sprout is emotional abuse. Constantly worrying about what they will focus on next is abuse. You do not need to apologize, you do not need to isolate yourself or make excuses in order to not make waves. You have every right to protect yourself and those around you. Do not wait until beliefs become actions, because that day may come far faster than you think. Take a look at all the families and friends devastated by the actions of people who participated in storming the Capital. 

I do not state any of this lightly. I went through a horrible divorce 16 years ago and know what it is to lose everything. There are people who will help you, reassure you, remind you that you are not alone. I am here and I am one of them. 

For those of you blessed enough to have people become disillusioned with this movement, provide support. Help them get counseling. Listen actively when they tell you why they started down this rabbit hole. We are not alone and we will not be silent. Remember that no relationship is worth more than your safety and sanity.

My family had always been fundamentalist Christians and ultra-conservative. My mom was a vaccine skeptic nurse and my dad was always going on about how the royal family, Dr. Phil, and Maury were lizard people, how Israel and the United States made a deal with aliens, how devil worshippers ruled the world, and the fluoride in water made people obedient. My dad leaned much more into the...how do I say, ""Of this world"" parts of conspiracy theories, while my mom was the more staunch and smug fundamentalist Christian who went to every church service at our small somewhat cult-like church full of speaking in tongues, demon and holy spirit possession, and that ""divine seed"" tithing thing where the pastor tells everyone the exact amount to donate. And I remember them always being anti-government, especially while Obama was in office, despite all of the social programs they were benefitting off of.

My family had also always been abusive. They had always hit me and beat me as a kid and used their religion, mixed with heavy alcoholism, to make themselves feel better than other people while also justifying all of their shitty actions.

The 2016 election cycle made it so much worse.

I remember hearing about Pizzagate from my dad non-stop, Hillary's emails. All of that jazz. They were convinced the election would be rigged and that Hillary would win no matter what. And then came the great upset victory for Donald Trump. I still remember hearing my parents screaming every time a state was called for orange and waking up to their gleeful cheers that it was announced that Donald had won. 

And then down the Q hole, they went.

Every time I think about it I wish Hillary had won, and maybe they wouldn't have been so emboldened by Trump to spout their beliefs in public and double, triple, and quadruple down on their beliefs. Maybe I'd still have parents.

They went from what was ""normal"" mom and dad, to Qmom and Qdad. .

 They caught me with my first boyfriend(I am gay) when I was 15, and it got worse.

 And then I told them I was enlisting into the US military around my senior year of high school. Originally, they were proud, because Trump was the president and as commander in chief, he would be my ""boss"". It seemed like a win-win situation, I get to get away from their craziness and homophobia forever, and they get to be proud of their son. It was the first time in a long, long time I felt I had their true approval. 

I had moved out in May of last year before I finished high school. At the time, it was a big deal. . We had gotten into a few arguments during the summer and the fall, but overall, our relationship, as damaged as it was from everything, still seemed fixable. I could go to my mom for advice on my current boyfriend and in life and she would respond and help me. 

Then trump lost his re-election bid. I didn't even bother speaking to my parents in between the election loss and the inauguration. I knew the only thing they'd want to talk about. 

Biden was inaugurated. I had already signed my contract with the Air Force back in November. They immediately turned on me. My Qmom and Qdad started to openly call me a traitor, tell me I was gonna be working for the ""deep state"" and totally cut me off when I told them ""In the military, you don't get to pick and choose which administration you serve under. You swear an oath to the constitution and the government representing it, no matter who is in power at the time and no matter if you agree with their policy or not"".  Our relationship was already on shaky ground. Now it was shattered. 

I just can't help but fear that they truly will never speak to me again. It's been about a month since they went totally silent on me. I'm only 18, I still have a long portion of my life to live, and the idea of living it without parents is just so upsetting. I can't believe they cut me off like that. It's just so unfair that some random asshole on 4chan gave my parents a justification for all of the things they've done to me and made them okay with cutting off their only son. Of all things, I was expecting it to be my gay relationship that made them cut me off. They had made comments about me coming out for a while. Maybe they had been planning this. My relationship with my parents was screwed, but it felt so fixable. It felt like one day, maybe even years down the line, we could come together and love one another again. Now my hopes for a fixed relationship are all but crushed. However, boy am I glad that I had moved out pre-election time. It just seems so unfair that they would do this to me.

I could go on and on. 

And now she says, after me setting a boundary saying anyone actively supporting Q doesn’t get to see the kids, she says “what makes you think I’m involved with Q?”

I feel CRAAAAAZY!!!

She has apologized saying “I’m sorry I’ve hurt you” but I mostly feel like it’s a non apology bc she just thinks my feelings are hurt unnecessarily bc she “never intentionally said anything to hurt me.”

I’m just so confused about how to navigate this, even with weekly therapy sessions with a psychologist. This is so hard.

I know you can't ""logic"" them out of it but wondered if anyone was trying to pre-emptively ""make a deal"" with your Q person.

Let them tell you what they think is going to happen March 4th and then simply ask them, if that doesn't happen will you stop believing? Try to make a deal. Get it in writing or on video. Let the results ""convince them"" rather than you convincing them.

I was at the craft store looking for a project. This is the kind of store that enforces mask rules hard core. No exceptions. This lady brought her kid in, no mask. Poor young worker had to go ask her to out on her mask, or offered to give her one. The lady said she didn't have one and would take it. So this girl gave her one. The lady took it, but didn't want to wear it. Young worker asked her to again, but when the lady kept refusing, she ran off. Now everyone is wearing a mask, even the lady's kid. So we are all giving her that look, but she ignored it all, just wandering around the store.

Now the manager comes over. He tells her she has to wear it, etc. Now she starts yelling. ""There's no law saying I have to wear it"" ""violating my civil rights"" etc. He tries to explain he is trying  to follow the state mandate, protect his employees. He is really trying to be reasonable and polite, but if she won't, she will have to leave. Then she goes full Q rude on him. According to her, when Trump is president again, he is going to shut down stores that force people to wear masks, and she will make sure he loses his job over this. It is sheep like him that make people afraid of covid, he just wants to control her but she won't let him. Her kid is almost crying. 

She finally leaves when he is going to call the police. How hard is it to put on the dumb mask? I mean, the store has got signs everywhere, it is not like she didn't know. Her kid is even wearing one. That poor kid looked like a miserable beat down puppy, wishing to be anywhere else. It seems like she went in looking for a fight the more I think about it. And to me that is so rude. I mean, the worker and manager don't have a choice. And it is a craft store, full of little old ladies.

I know my Q family used to watch 60 minutes every Sunday. It’s been a ritual for many homes for many years. I feel like they are a “trusted news source”

Besides that, she has started treating me like the house slave because I'm no more intelligent than the ""sheeple"".

I have no outs because I'm on a different passport, and if the marriage breaks there's a good chance I have to leave my kid with my wife, with no sane supervision.

He also worked for an overtly political ministry and, unbeknownst to most everyone but a few of us, was a closet UFO and conspiracy fan. He was also a dedicated and gentle grandfather to my kids, and the best friend I ever had. 

Still, the last few years of his life, his rages at the left, gays, and immigrants had become more regular and more just... mean. He was only mean to people he didn’t know for the most part. I know that might be hard to understand. His diatribes about those people were reserved for his family mostly. But he and I did cross words a bit and he did once say we were “diametrically opposed” because I voted for Obama. That was so painful at the time.

Trump is like a god to her. She has tons of books about him, a giant Trump 2020 flag on her bedroom wall, and a Trump bobblehead to top it all off. When I was 14 and didn’t understand the weight of Trump’s candidacy, this was hilarious to me. Trump was a joke in my mind, and I didn’t see how deep my mom’s devotion to him went. We’d all make jokes about whatever dumb shit he’d do that week, and my mom would laugh but always make sure to defend him as well. She was so invested in Trump’s initial campaign and I only saw it as a bonding point for us. Even if I didn’t understand or care about Trump, he was something my mom and I could joke about. For Christmas I got her a copy of Art of the Deal, and for her birthday I got her the bobblehead.

Honestly, if I had a time machine, I’d go back and deck my 14 year old self for fueling her obsession like that. I wish I could’ve stopped it then, somehow. I regret it so fucking much, because since 2020, her absolute ***LOVE*** for him has been a nightmare for our family.

I’ve gotten way more liberal since I was 14. I donated as much as I could to Bernie, registered as a Democrat when I turned 18, and voted for Biden without a second thought. So obviously my political views are in STARK contrast to my mom’s, and even my dad’s, though he’s less intense about his. I’d probably say that my hatred for Trump and Republicans in general is just as strong as my mom’s undying trust and adoration for them, because since 2016, I’ve watched them completely destroy the mom I grew up with. I can’t even put into words how much I miss her and the relationship we used to have. 2020 was hell for us. We’d get in fights all the time, because she wears her views on her sleeve and I couldn’t keep my mouth shut when she’d go on rants about communism, BLM, antifa, and Democrats. I always felt like she was personally attacking my beliefs, and I was hurt.

Our fighting got so bad that my family staged an intervention for her in the middle of the year. It was fucking horrible. I never want to live through another night like that. My dad and I tried talking to my mom calmly about her addiction to right-wing social media and videos, but she got insanely hostile and defensive and started freaking out, which led to a bunch of crying and yelling from almost everyone. My sister, who was just 14 at the time, was bawling during it and was terrified our family was gonna break down. I felt awful, and I honestly felt like it was my fault. Like I should’ve just kept my mouth shut during all my mom’s rants, and we would’ve been fine. The next day, I actually went to my dad and told him I felt like I was toxic to the family. He reassured me that I wasn’t, but I dunno if I believe(d) it or not.

A few days later, my mom sent us a text explaining herself and said she was angry during the intervention “because her daughter had to watch the two men in her lives treat her like that”.

My dad got the text before I did, and told me not to read it. Obviously after such a fucking weird and ominous warning, I had to. And I was fucking LIVID. I went for a walk and when I came back, my mom wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything. She promised she’d take a break from social media and come back to the family again, and we made up. But that only lasted a few weeks until she slowly but surely fell back into the same addictions and routines.

Regardless, she and I still managed to go a few months without fighting, though it got harder when her intense opposition to masks started to become more prominent. My mom wears a mask, but it’s not really a mask. She bought a fake-out mask off of etsy. It looks like a proper one, but really it’s full of breathing holes. So that’s pretty fucking shitty of her. She doesn’t even wear a mask around my grandma. HER OWN MOTHER, because it’s “outside so it’s okay”.

UMMMM? MY GRANDMA IS 81 YEARS OLD. IF YOU DONT WANNA WEAR A REAL MASK AT A STORE BECAUSE “COVID’S JUST A FLU AND ONLY AFFECTS OLDER PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS”, FINE. IT’S FUCKING STUPID AND GROSSLY MISINFORMED OF YOU, BUT FINE.

BUT FUCKING ***81 YEARS OLD. SHE IS IN THE RANGE THAT YOU YOURSELF HAVE ADMITTED IS DANGEROUS. BUT YOU’RE SO FUCKING COMMITTED TO YOUR REBELLIOUS ANTI-GOVERNMENT LARP THAT YOU WON’T FUCKING WEAR A FUCKING MASK AROUND YOUR ELDERLY FUCKING MOTHER. THE PERSON WHO FUCKING RAISED YOU. I THINK MAYBE YOU OWE HER A PIECE OF CLOTH OVER YOUR FUCKING MOUTH AND NOSTRILS????***

anyway

I’d always gently try to nudge my mom in the right direction, but it never worked. She’d always get passive aggressive about it. Then December came, and we were going to pick out a tree. The night before, I’d read about how covid cases in our areas were on the rise. I was scared, so I decided to directly ask my mom if she’d be okay with wearing a real mask when we went. She got visibly frustrated and basically answered with “I don’t own one, so if you’re so uncomfortable with me not wearing one, just don’t come with us.”

Never mind the fact that you could borrow one of my five, but okay.

I should’ve responded calmly to that, but for some reason, that was the tipping point for me. It was like a whole year’s worth of rage came pouring out of me and I couldn't control myself. I started shaking and went on a really fucking loud rant about how she’d been brainwashed, was wrong about everything, and was consistently putting our family in danger. I’ve never argued so intensely with someone in my life. It was fucking awful. I hated it. I hope I never feel the need to talk to my mom like that ever again. But the absolute worst part came after, when my dad came to talk to me about it. He was so fucking pissed. He told me I was “forcing my beliefs on other people” and dividing the family. I told him they were endangering and failing us. I think about that conversation a lot, but I’ve never talked to my dad about it. My therapist thinks I should, but I just want to forget it happened.

My dad’s on the same side as me now, though. Though he still sees covid as a non-issue, he sees how brainwashed my mom is. She’s constantly talking to him about how Trump is still President and is just waiting for the right time to reveal it. She’s funneling conspiracy theories down his throat, and I can see how exhausted and worried he is. We’ve talked a lot lately about if there’s anything we can possibly do to help her, but we’re both at a complete loss. She won’t see the therapist she used to go to, because she knows the therapist is a liberal so she doesn’t trust her. She also strongly insists she doesn’t need therapy, and we can’t exactly force her there.

Today my parents and sister came home from a two-day vacation, and within an hour, I could hear my mom screaming at my dad about how he’s “trying to keep her from having her own opinions and beliefs”. She’s been in her room since, and when I asked my dad what sparked the argument, his response really fucked with me.

Apparently she’d started ranting about politics on the car ride home, and my dad reached his threshold today and confronted her about how insane her conspiracy theories are. When we talked, he told me that he has no idea what to do, that she’s “a different person”, and when I said I was really worried that this would end in divorce, he didn’t say otherwise. He just seemed so fucking sad, and kept apologizing for us being in this situation.

I feel like I should tell my mom how much her obsessions are affecting the family (she insists she keeps her politics to herself, but that’s clearly not the case. For fuck sake, she came home wearing a 2nd amendment sweatshirt), but I’m honestly terrified of confronting her about anything political again. I’ve fought with her so much and so often, I don’t want to anymore. It hurts me so much to be in that position with her, but maybe I need to be there again. I don’t know. I just want my mom back, so fucking badly.

Anyways, sorry this was super long, I just needed to rant to people ‘cause I don’t have therapy until tomorrow and I’m not close enough with any of my extended family to talk to them about this.

I have been close with my siblings all of my life. We always talked about Politics, even if we did agreed. That was up until 2 and a half years ago. 

I made a joke to one of my sisters, after Trump made a speech on The 4th of July. In this speech he made a mistake and said something along the lines of, in the Revolutionary War we took the Airports first. I thought this was hilarious. So, when I saw my sister that night she said she had taken her kids to the Revolutionary War Museum. I said did you see the airplanes and I laughed. She got very upset, barely talked to me the whole weekend and apparently complained to the whole family that I make everything political. When I was confronted by one of my other sisters, I was told I should apologize. My comment back was I did not make it political, it was funny and I had nothing to apologize for. I did however try to be careful of any other comments so as not to create waves. Then came 2020. I tried to ignore the posts on FB and did not text my family much before the election, because I did not want to alienate them. After the election I started to get messages and texts from aunts, uncles, cousins, and siblings about how the election was stolen and about the mass voting fraud. I tried not to be condescending with replies, but a person can only take so much. One of my brothers, who I have always thought was intelligent, texted me during work with this super long text explaining, with articles and videos, how there were these massive data dumps during the counts on election night. I did respond to say that these so called data dumps were in fact mail in ballots being counted, because of when each state was allowed to process these. I also said do you really think that the democratics could pull this off and even recruit republicans without anyone speaking up? He came back with those republicans are “never Trumpers”.  I asked that he stop texting me these things and while he said he would, he didn’t stop. 

I need to explain that I come from a military family. So, after the attack on the capital, when I had heard a rumor that this brother was at the Trump Rally on the sixth, on the 7th I worked up enough courage to I ask a question I wish I had never asked, I texted him “Were you at the Capital yesterday?”  His reply was “Yes, I was expressing my 1st amendment right and I am proud to have been there. It was sad how it ended.” It was the first time in my life I have been ashamed of an action one of my siblings took. I received a text soon after from a sister, saying she couldn’t believe that I was upset about what happened on the 6th, but I was ok with riots over the summer. Again I tried to explain they weren’t the same and that while I agreed with protester this summer, I did not agree with the rioting. A lot was said on that text thread that I wish I could forget. She talked about how the US was on the brink of a color war, how she was tired of being called a racist for the past 4 years and that I should not trust the MS media. A couple of days later she decided she could not talk about politics with me any longer. This was probably a good decision. 

Now my mom has been back and forth on what she thinks of all of this and up until a couple of weeks ago she was going to get the COVID-19 vaccine. I had not really said much to her on this, but I was secretly glad that in this one instance she was going to do what was best for her. Then suddenly she changed her mind, my mom knew I was upset that she had decided not to get the vaccine. She told me that she had talked to my sister and with all the issues with the vaccine she did not feel comfortable getting it. I know what your thinking, my mom is an adult and can make up her own mind. I don’t completely disagree with that, except that this sister is in the medical field and my mom is 87, has congenital heart disease and is a breast cancer survivor. Hours after this conversation with my mom, I received a text on the siblings feed from said sister, informing us of the conversation she had with my mom earlier in the week. My self and one brother expressed that we felt it was irresponsible to advise mom this way. Then the four siblings start in on how the vaccine changes your DNA, the shape of your cells, that the animal testing was skipped, how the vaccine can cause fertility issues and it can be found in the placenta. After my brother and I asked the 4 to stop 3 times, they kept texting. It is almost like they not only have to get the last word in, but by doing so they are right. My brother then said he would be blocking us all so he would not have to listen to all of the QAnon debates. No one protested over this declaration. I sent a separate text to my brother telling him not block me. He said would not, but that he can’t listen to anymore Trump/QAnon “Bullshit”. Even after that my sibling didn’t stop. One even saying C’est la vie!! I truly couldn’t believe that my siblings were ok with throwing one of us away!! Is all of this crap really so important to you??  How do they not see the truth? This was the last straw for my one brother and me. I stopped responding to the 4 siblings, but can’t stand the thought of blocking them. A week later 2 sisters texted me like nothing had happen the week before and the sister, that sent the text informing us the week before, sent a text apologizing. Saying she didn’t mean for the conversation to turn into what it did. She missed me and wanted to talk. I told her that I do not want to talk right now and that I don’t know how we come back from this. She then said something I find ironic “Our love is stronger than any government or disease”. Really? Did she not see the same conversation I saw? I have cried myself to sleep for the past 2 and a half weeks, not to mention the times before this, feeling them slip away.

I go back to the dates never coming to fruition and now Q doesn’t post using specific dates as he did before, that Q used to write differently on 4chan vs 8kun and his first post about Hillary never happened. 

I’m sure he was shocked at everything I knew, but all I get is “Disinformation is necessary”.  So I question, how do QAnons decipher what’s false and what’s true??  What makes everything you (or others) think to be true and not disinformation? 

He says the posts are in codes and necessary to throw people off, to see if they are true Anons/Patriots. So, you’re telling me the same Deep State running the world for the last how-many-ever-years are easily thrown off while your average QAnon is able to decipher the codes and he posted on 4chan because it’s a free platform?  My Qultist is one of the most computer illiterate people I know, barely able to work a printer; and I’m supposed to believe he can outsmart the Deep State?  Not buying it.

I don’t know much about the tripcodes but highly doubt a top military official would choose to use that platform. He brings up people like Julian Assange, operation mockingbird or that Epstein was arrested, and that’s suppose to be the truth that Q exists? 

When he would say there’s a reason behind Trump posting ‘covfefe’, I knew I was losing him.  What do you even say to “disinformation is necessary”?

Yet.

She has always been a loving woman and someone I genuinely admired growing up, she was always a beacon of optimism.

After her cancer diagnosis in 2018 (she's cured now btw), she stopped working and went on an early retirement. This gave her a lot of time to pursue her passions and for a time we were all very happy for her, she seemed  to be getting out of that terrible time rather well. 

Now with the pandemic however, she's starting to talk about conspiracy theories more and more. She's at home more and just browses the internet for the entire day.

Everytime we talk it eventually gets to her lecturing me about how the government of my country is comprised of ""a bunch of leftist globalists"", how the vaccine changes your DNA and how men apparently aren't allowed to be men anymore. 

I tried to reason with her and calmly explain that the government is in fact not socialist, that more attention to the problems and needs of minorities isn't a threat to white people but she just doesn't seem to want to get it. 

2 weeks ago she told me she intends to vote for a party in our country called FvD, a far-right, mysoginistic cult similar to Trumpism. She started to dismiss any criticism of the party as some lie fabricated by the media.

I’m 28(f) and throughout my 20s I struggled with the relationship I have with my mum. For context, we moved to London from Poland when I was 12 with younger brother (now 24) my mum and dad. They divorced shortly after and my dad isn’t in the picture for years. With her being alone in the new country, I was the first one who learned English, we had money issues so for years I would be dragged into translating council issues, calling providers, taking care of stuff, took me to court as a translator too, in hindsight I really shouldn’t have done any of it, it messed me up and I still go therapy to sort it. 

Nowadays, she tells me I never done anything growing up, and sweeps that whole chapter under the rug. 

Before the pandemic, we would still fight, mostly over me not being there enough for her and me gaining weight (fat shamed me for 5 years). She would always try to force some weird holistic approach, finding “magic cures” on Facebook. Magnetised water or some other bull. 

Well now that the pandemic is here, it feels so much worse. The London lockdowns are pretty strict, and I do try my best to follow the advise where possible. Definitely a household of science believers. My mum is not. She supports anti-vaxxes, believes in most conspiracies, such as the pandemic being planned, it not being as serious, even has weird Q believes where Trump is “the saviour”  and democrats are all pedophiles. (She’s Polish and lives in the UK, it still confuses me why she cares).

My brother also believes in conspiracies and they egg each other on. However, he moved to Poland in July 2020 so I’m the last family she has here. They both believe I’m the “sheep” and they are open minded. I want to be careful about seeing my mum because I have had friends who’s parents died from the virus, and even people my age struggles with the disease. 

So now we see each other less, and she blames me for it. She thinks I’m an idiot for wanting to stay safe, and also thinks I don’t wanna see her at all. Just got off the call with her where she said stuff like “I won’t bother inviting you to stay at mine” “you do not wanna see me at all, that’s fine”. I was literally calling her to see her for a walk, but she didn’t want to cos it’s cold. It all escalated and I ended up in tears. 

I don’t know what to do, like they are both super deep into these conspiracies, and there is nothing I can do to get them out of it. I tired since March 2020. We fight about it all the time. I try to change the subject often. I just want it to be normal, and healthy, but instead all I feel is guilt. I don’t know how to stop feeling this way. I’m doing as well as I can at this point, I work from home, I exercise, take vitamins, try to be kind to myself to survive this lockdown.

I've read through articles just recently and it has been so strange to realize that what I was thinking/seeing/going through was happening all over. I thought it was just me.

My husband started talking about this back in March of last year, circling through the summer and into the end of the year, when it got really bad. I'm happy to say that I think for the majority of it, I've gotten my husband back, but I'm still not 100% sure.

Back during the height of the mess, I was in the garage on a few nights with him and a friend when I first heard talk about the conspiracy nature of everything going on. The pedophile ring, the election conspiracy, the deep state, the QAnon predictions. My husband not trusting the pandemic, stopping use of Google and moving to Parlor, getting into conversations on other websites that were unmonitored and uncontrolled. He got more involved in ensuring his guns and ammo were stocked up, his safety was secure and connected himself to resources offering me the option to go through gun safety so that I understood and prepared myself for anything. I tried to wipe my fears away and hide how strange it was to me, but it just grew worse leading into winter of 2020. Eventually I stopped sitting/standing with them as they talked and even though my husband grew silent and heavily involved in this 'world', he still remained open to me and worked hard, nothing changing that I could see that took him away from me. As I realize others did, I took on the roles of taking care of day to day things like bills, groceries, cleaning, etc. I was (and still am) working from home so I ensured to focus entirely on that, the current and now, to keep myself sane and honestly not have the heated topics in conversation like the ""COVID conspiracy"" or how the mask mandates were just a way to hold us down. I just continued to focus on what I could control. Luckily as we creep further into 2021, I am starting to feel a bit lighter.

There was a short period of time in the height of the election &amp; the following month that threw me for a loop, but I held on. I braced myself for this great awakening to only find that as time went by, life continued on. I saw that my husband stepped back closer to me. Eventually we did have a few discussions and I am mostly sure that he's come back ""down"" to me. He did say that he felt sad that he was lied to and that even though he thinks now that there are still things ""yet to come"", he realizes that the things he was told were false and he no longer believed in the Q conspiracy.

So now that I see that I am by far not alone (thanks to a post I finally found,), I know that I could really use to help through this and maybe I can offer support to others out there.

At first it was just because I was awestruck at their theories and conspiracies. I have to admit I checked the boards any time I would pick up my phone.  Without believing a word of it I still feel like I felt, to some degree, what they feel, some level of addiction.

And, at the time, I found the most interesting threads were the ones where people expressed doubt towards their own beliefs—or “doomer threads”, as Q people are apt to call them.

Most doomer threads don’t last long.  They get downvoted to oblivion, or banned by the moderators who don’t want a public showing of doubt towards their beloved ideology. But there was one doomer thread that skyrocketed to the top of GA, and it happened shortly after the inauguration.

I think the thread was allowed for a couple of reasons: first, a lot of Q followers felt some level of disappointment after Biden was sworn in and it became a place to vent. And second, because of the title of the post. The title of the post, and this is all from memory so it may not be exact, was something like:

“Well, after 22 years, she’s divorcing me!”

The post was authored by a man who’d been married to his wife for 22 years, and she’d left him shortly after the inauguration because of his Q beliefs.  But what shocked me was that the spin he put on it was *almost* positive. He was trying to use it as a “badge of honor” of sorts— “my-swinging-dick-is-bigger-than-your-swinging-dick-because-I-believed-so-hard-that-my-wife-left-me.”

And *everyone* supported  it.  The thread was full of comments like “you dodged a bullet,” “you’re better off without her,” and “that’s what you get for marrying a lib.” There wasn’t a single comment that suggested maybe he should chill out on the Q stuff for a little while, or asked him if he was okay.  Not one. I looked.

Then, reading through his responses to the comments in the thread, I realized he *wasn’t* okay.  And after rereading the original post, I saw that it was filled with thinly veiled panic masked by weak machismo.  And his responses were even less convincing. Stuff like:

“Thanks for the support, but after 22 years I’m a little worried how I’m going to fend for myself.”

“I actually really love her, I thought she was my soul mate.”

“I know she was a leftist and I know how important the work we do here is, but something about this just feels wrong.”

And just like that, I went my fascination in Q followers turn to ash in my mouth. Like, fuck. This guy’s life has just been turned upside down, and the only group he can turn to for solace is so ass backwards that they can’t imagine *not* being happy about divorcing someone you’ve loved for over two decades, purely because she a liberal. 

You could see him squirming in his post history. Trying to hint that he needed emotional support from the people he considered his friends. But it just wasn’t going to work—that’s not who these people are.

It was fucking tragic and after that, I stopped browsing the boards so often, and I stopped being angry at these people.  I couldn’t get riled up reading their insane beliefs anymore because I could only feel pity.  I know a lot of people on this subreddit feel like their loved one is a different person, or has become crass to their affections, and worry that they may be gone for good. And I’m no expert, but to me, that guy who made that one post on GA will always be proof that somewhere, buried beneath mountains of insecurity, denial, and fear, is the person they were before the Q shit hit the fan.

First, I was able to get my Q-mom to open up enough that I was shocked to discover she thought she had been ""having conversations with me telepathically for more than a year""!! (boggle!  😳😱)  No wonder she seemed to blow up over the tiniest things - as if she'd been arguing with me about it hours per day for a year! 

I started to work with her, following a therapist's advice, by normalizing her need to converse, sometimes out loud, with her imaginary friends. At first, I made up my own inner conversation partners and occasionally talked to ""them"" around her.

Until after a few attempts at this, she looked at me like I was the crazy one.  ""You're just making that up!  Or you need to clean out your ears... all that wax crackling about.  Here, I'll transcribe what I hear and you do the same and we'll compare.""

""Um.... okay.... mom... gotta go um.... pick up some things from the grocery.""  Me slowly backing away.

""It's 1am.  Grocery's closed.  Nice try.  Good one.""

And that began the all-night conversation which led to me transcribing, with her help, all the ""conversations"" she was having in her head.  I'm pretty sure I've got a good novel's worth.  

Some she thought were with God.  Some Jesus.  And maybe some Men in Black super secret alien agent movie plot mixed in there. 

But once I started writing it all down to help her understand how to deal with the hallucinations better, I noticed a couple of things.

One - as a machine learning and natural language processing type, I immediately recognized the tell-tale signs of...  GPT-2 - and similar ""generative text"" systems.

I could even feed her things to ""say back to the voices"" and effectively retrain the model a bit.  And predict the outcome - great magic trick for getting through to Q-mom.

Anyway, it's taken over a year... a very strange one at that, but, although she wears her earbuds everywhere now so she can look like she's having a phone conversation if she needs to drown out the ""voices"" while out in public... apart from that, I think I may have my mom back.

I found this sub and thought I'd post my experience. The relationship with my mother and I (34M) has been a bit strained ever since I got married. We were always a bit snappy with each other and frequently had disagreements about how to do things - e.g. the way I was raising my child etc

Befofe Covid19, she was looking after my child for 2 days a week whilst my partner worked (I work full time).
When Covid19 hit, both my parents understandably went into isolation - they didn't see us or my daughter and ceased having her every week. We were all scared back then so this was fine

When things started opening back up in the UK, I noticed that my mum was posting increasingly erratic things on FB. It started with criticism of the government - which is totally acceptable, the UK gov were reckless with Covid19. Her posts then started to spill into posting ""doctors"" talking ""facts"" about Covid19 - things like death rates, cause of death &amp; why it isn't as serious

When the next lockdown hit (UK have had 3 so far) she was less tolerant/scared than before so went full throttle on ""doing her own research"" and posting it on FB. Laughably, the majority of things she shares on FB get labelled as missinformation, but this is of course a FB attempt to silence her. Things really ramped up with the news of the vaccine. She went into fake news hyper drive, the whole works of microchips and 5g. 

When Christmas rolled around, I decided to go round there and try to put all aside to have a nice time. She spent most of the day telling us various snippets of information such as how the Queen was really dead and the person on TV was a stand-in.
It all culminated on boxing Day with me being tired of the shot and asking her straight up if she believed that the government are trying to implant people with a 5g controllable microchip - she said she did and it was called nanotechnology
I called her crazy and said she needed help (a release of frustration on my part!) And her reaction was to refuse to have my daughter every week. 

Fast forward to today, she has not seen my daughter for 2 months now. We have not spoken to her for the same time. My parents have agreed to separate wherever possible, apparently they've felt like that for ages. Whenever my dad asks her to come and see my daughter with him in the park, she refuses. She doesn't ask after her at all. 
That has been the most shocking part of all this; this collection of conspiracy theories has in effect had a contribution to make her not want to see her granddaighter anymore. 

Some of the things she believes (so far) - maybe it will resonate with other people in the UK/world:

	- Covid19 is a hoax, perpetuated by the world elite (bezos,Zuckerberg,gates) to reset the population
	- The UK government are in on this and will be arrested any day via a common law uprising
	- The government are putting things in the water (she now drinks water out of a jug with anrod of charcoal in it)
	- That the common law of the land will soon overtake actual law via the magna carta declarations. She has printed several letters to barons in the UK pledging allegiance to them
	- That the vaccine is poison and has 5g chips in it. She has even gone as far as to verbally accost volunteers at vaccine centers whilst passing
	- She refuses to wear a mask anywhere she goes. In the UK, you're now challenged if you enter a shop without one unless you medically exempt; she has bought a special lanyard you can wear to pretend she has a disability and is exempt
	- She goes on anti protest rallies in London and Brighton. She has two new protesting friends she has never known before that she is close to

It is r/StreetEpistemology or SE for short. SE has many advantages over a traditional debate. Rather than trying to convince the other person of anything it simply aims at getting them to think critically about the methods they are using to reach a conclusion. This will gently nudge them into considering how certain they are if a belief is true or not and to reanalyze their beliefs. It takes less energy and time than other methods, and is much more peaceful and friendly. It is also much easier to learn than most other techniques I've tried, and can be learned by simply watching/listening to others do it on YouTube and practicing for oneself, though it does help to read books and such on the subject as well. With time it becomes so natural one will catch themselves doing it without even trying.  


So for how this saved my friends and family: since the pandemic started I've been using my SE skills to deescalate confrontation, better understand the wants and needs of my family, and most importantly discuss the information my family and friends find about various current events. At first some of them were definitely beginning to fall hook line and sinker into the pit of conspiracy theories, and they still do struggle sometimes, but here is where my store differs from those here. After enough practice in SE I was able to get them to reconsider these beliefs more carefully, and now I don't even really need to use SE much at all. They will simply show me whatever new conspiracy theory they are falling for and I fact check it for them (and try to give a brief explanation of how I can tell fact from fiction to make them less dependent on me with time). They've gained enough trust in my abilities that we can skip right to the end of the debate and just finish off the misinformation. It is still very important that I remain open minded to their beliefs. I haven't convinced them I'm smarter than them, and I don't act better nor believe I am better or smarter than them (if I did they would stop trusting me). I've simply proven to them my ability to sort fact from fiction enough that they pretty much take my word for it. All information they send my way I treat as though it could be true, but give it the analysis. My communication skills aren't perfect but I do my best not to make them feel judged even if they bring up something wild, this makes them much more comfortable sharing and trusting me.

Reddit included. Please be kind. I wanted to find a space to talk to people in the same situation as myself.

Recently - my mother has been incredibly vocal about not getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Almost every morning she sends me nonsense videos about it. Talking about patent code 666, there's an ingredient in it called 'Luciferous', it will change your DNA, etc. She goes on and on. The videos are of no merit &amp; have no sources. The first one she sent me was of a Dr. Christiane Northrup. I did some research on her and turns our she was once a normal respected doctor turned kook in recent years. 

Now two days ago my sister tells me that my mom is into some ""Simon Parkes Org"". I, of course, did some of my own research on this guy and his website. All of it is completely bonkers. But I'm not sure if it's considered ""QAnon""? Is anyone else familiar with this 'Simon Parkes'? 

Like I said - she has been completely anti-vac for at least the last month or so. Sending me messages with crazy videos almost daily that make zero sense &amp; have no real facts. She also has made mention to me about 5G &amp; blocking it. Again, not sure if this is QAnon or not?

Quote she sent me in a message: ""I know you are skeptical and siding with mainsteam media and censuring that is going on related to the covid vaccine."" Sounds like straight QAnon BS to me. 

My sister informed me she also said: Trump is president and Biden is projected in a studio out of CA, All democrats are going to be arrested, new capitol will be in Texas, Trump will be renounced as the 19th president at that time????? I know most of this is QAnon. And mind you this is like a game of telephone because my sister doesn't live there either, she is hearing this from our dad (who is Republican &amp; a Trumper but thinks this QAnon stuff is going too far). He said she spends almost all day glued to her phone.

My mom has never been one to really be into politics at all. My sister &amp; I were vaccinated as children. She has never brought up any of this stuff in my 31 years on this earth. I am terrified it is QAnon &amp; I don't know what I can do to stop it. I feel like she's just going to keep getting more &amp; more stuck down the rabbit hole.

I won't repeat all the details of my Q-story from the beginning as it would be very long; you can read through my post history if you want the whole thing.  Short version-gay, with my husband for 15 years, 4 of them legally married.  I discovered he was in Q late last summer, although I now think he was in as early as March 2020.  He's gone the whole gamut-not just Q and Trump and Adrenochrome, but aliens, Simon Parkes, Charlie Ward, santa surfing, and all those grifters.  I don't know who got who into it, but he and my brother in law are also Q buddies.

I started therapy about a month ago.  I've asked Qhub to do counseling with me several times and he refuses.  But, with the help of my therapist, I wrote him a very long, very loving letter about how this has hurt me, the negative affects its had on us, and how I wanted to save our relationship and get him out of this.  The therapist coached me and helped me revise it so it was very, very loving, as nonjudgmental, and nonconfrontational as possible, and using all us/we statements, not I/me.  Just the way all the cult experts recommend.  I gave it to him on the 6th.  After a near 2 hour conversation which was very difficult, but we got through it, we made a commitment that he would drop all alternative media for 3 weeks-taking us to March 4, which happens to be his birthday (I know).  He claimed he didn't know anything about March 4 being the new Q date because he ""doesn't follow Q""-he's very good at flipping the script and gaslighting and using technicalities and such to get out of what I know to be true and making ME feel like the crazy one.  But, I let all that go, because I got the commitment.  He even deleted Epoch Times, Newsmax, and OANN off his phone right in front of me.

Since then, life has been really good.  We went out for dim sum the next day and we've had several very nice date nights since, and it felt SO good.  That's what hurts so much.   I knew he wasn't deprogrammed by any stretch, but I thought the process had started.  I saw real potential of saving my marriage.

Today I discovered that he is still watching videos in violation of our agreement.  He maybe made it a week tops and then right back to Q.  It's more important to him than me, our marriage, our dogs, etc.  That's it.  I haven't told him yet, but I can't take anymore.  He needs professional help and I'm not qualified to give it.  I'm done.  I haven't confronted him yet; I'm just too tired for that tonight.  I'm going to sleep on it.

I'm new to Reddit, having joined today to check out QAnonCasualties, after reading a great, but emotional and sobering article about this subreddit, and it really resonated with me.

In summary, I have a stepmother, who is now fully bought into Trumpism. My elderly father, who has cognitive difficulties, goes along with it, though he probably is not as personally dedicated to those sets of beliefs. Our once-close relationship is now near the point of non-existence.

I'd like to post and discuss more details about this, and most of all commiserate with people in a similar situation. First, though, I want to ask if this is the right subreddit for that, as I do not know if they are into QAnon, in addition to Trumpism. If this is not the right place for that, I'd certainly appreciate any pointers to other subreddits.

I’m so glad I found this group because I need some support from people with similar experiences. My heart breaks when I read about the broken families here, and I fear I may be facing a similar tragedy.

I’d like to get some perspectives on how concerned I should be about my boyfriend at this point. How can I tell when it’s time for an intervention, or if I need to get out of the relationship?

My BF is a kindhearted 60-year old man who was taken in by the Trump cult. He did vote for Obama 2008, but for some reason he became fervently anti-Obama after that (I’m guessing because of the social circle he was in). Knowing he’s life experiences, I can understand why the MAGA message resonates with him. I do respect his views, and he respects mine. But it scares me to think that he might continue to blindly follow Trump even further into the abyss. After all, Trump spouts QAnon nonsense, and he may become even more extreme now that he lost the election and was acquitted in the impeachment trial.

He doesn’t follow QAnon, per se, but is exposed to messaging that comes through in his newsfeeds (OAN, Newsmax, Fox, Facebook). I’m pretty confident that the most extreme claims would be too much for him to stomach. For example, he wouldn’t buy into the Pizzagate or Wayfair pedophilia lies, or the idea that school shootings are staged.

He believes everyone is against Trump because he stopped people from making money on wars and other political corruption. I have never heard him refer to the “deep state”, though.

He hasn’t said straight out that the election “was stolen”, but does believe there is widespread voter fraud (illegals being able to vote, etc.). Still believes Trump won the popular vote 2016. He has accepted that Biden is now the president and says he wants him to succeed. But he also believes much of the “socialist” scaremongering. He called Biden’s many executive orders “dictatorial”! He believes all the lies about the Biden family, including the one about Hunter’s laptop.

He often brings up the child trafficking thing, but I think he might have softened a little bit on that after I gave him some facts about it. The other night, though, he said “I don’t like that guy” about Tom Hanks. I realized later it was because of the pedophilia rumors.

He railed against the violence that took place last summer, but says nothing about the Capitol riots. Early on he hinted that it might have been Antifa/BLM who entered the Capitol, but I’m not sure what he thinks now–and I’m afraid to ask! To be fair, he wouldn’t condone violence from any side.

He really hates white supremacists, though, and I can tell he's sincere about that. He says he believes that everybody, regardless of race or sexual orientation, is equal and should be treated with the same respect. And he is indeed respectful to everyone he meets. But on the other hand, he holds views that I find disturbing and are based on misinformation from the far right. For example, he really dislikes the BLM movement and believes that racism is a thing of the past. His view is that the protesters are asking for “special treatment”, not equality. Similar thing with the LGBTQ movement.

He thought that Covid was deliberately spread by China and that the California wildfires were started by Antifa people (doesn’t seem to believe in human caused climate change). I think he might have soften his views on these subjects as well, as he’s seeing the Covid situation play out.

Is there hope for a guy like him, who is on the fringe of the fringe, so to speak? He seems to have a crack open where it’s possible to get to him, and he is open to hearing my thoughts. In fact, he specifically states that “we are not enemies”. But how could I tell if he’s actually more radical or closed up than he lets on? Could he be hiding his worst tendencies because he knows how I feel?

She’s fallen down the Q hole obviously. I wrote it out but can’t get myself to send it. Maybe all I needed was to write it down. Anyways, for context, the latest thing she sent me was something saying that the snow in Texas wouldn’t melt and is fake and is part of some Chinese operation to modify the weather. I thought that I could share it with this group:


That snow thing is so wrong and I’m so sick of seeing stupid shit like that being peddled by these idiots. I can tell you why it’s wrong but I doubt you want to hear it because you seem intent of filling your mind with this crap. And then on top of it you will not allow yourself to absorb any shred of logical information because you believe that anything that doesn’t fulfill your confirmation bias is a product of a society that is hell-bent on deceiving you. 

I’m putting boundaries on this. I don’t want to see any of this anymore. You have proven yourself incapable of vetting any of this information and therefore I don’t want to see any of it. There is no deep state-sponsored pedophilia ring. There is no Q. There is no elitist adrenachrome market. Trump is not the president. He will not be the president on March 4th. There is no financial reset. The vaccines are not designed to exterminate or otherwise control the population. None of this stuff has come true. None of it.

What there is is an imperfect world. Yes pedophiles exist. Yes people do some fucked up things. Yes some politicians are corrupt and have ulterior motives. Science is messy and rarely straightforward. And there are trolls out there that see an opportunity in that and take delight in seeing the world turn on itself. 

QAnon is a disease. I have joined a group of almost 135,000 people that is for individuals who have lost someone to QAnon. Friends, siblings, partners, spouses. And it is endless. 30+ year marriages ruined. Friendships alienated. Parents and their children disowning one another. People committing SUICIDE because they’re terrified of what they think is coming. These people have the same behavior patterns as addicts and it seems like there is nothing that their loved ones can do about it except hope and pray that they snap out of it before more damage is done. 

QAnon preys on people. It preys on their insecurities. It prays on their traumas. It preys on their religion. It tells them that all of their problems are from the design of a singular sinister force and then it gives them a false hope that soon everything will be over and some alternate reality will replace the one we have today. But it’s just that. False hope. The goalposts will always be moved. You will constantly be disappointed in the outcome until you realize that none of this is real. There will always be some reason, some plan, some story as to why what “they” say is happening, doesn’t happen.

This cult has built a self-affirming echo chamber around itself and its followers. Everyone is constantly searching for the “truth” and shouting into a dark room what they think they no. Meanwhile any light from the outside is shut out. It is bad for you. It will deceive you. Don’t look at it, look at what we have to say. Trust the plan. Bullshit. That’s just a thought terminating clause meant stop people from applying reason and logic and emotion to the situation. It’s meant to keep them at bay and blindly following a leaderless conglomeration of lost ideas. 

I’ve tried to keep up with Q. I wanted to stay informed on what had you in its grips because I care about you. But I’ve taken a mental health break from it. Because I get SO ANGRY at the sheer fallacy of the things being preached and knowing that my own mother is right there cheering it on. And I’m terrified that this will come between you and dad. So yes, I am choosing ignorance and hoping I find some bliss. With that, I ask you to not share any of this stuff with me. I will not enable it.

A little bit of a backstory, my grandma was always conservative and she grew up as a devout Mormon. However over the past two years, I noticed a shift in her mentality. Not much I could really say other than she was spouting crazy right wing conspiracies and her entire existence became political. As a result, it damaged my view on her considerably. I always ignored her facebook posts, but a month back, she said something I could not ignore. She posted an image about Nazi Germany which was flat out incorrect on multiple fronts. Being the kind of person who hates historical revisionism, I took the time to correct every statement the image made and as a result, her conservative cousin agreed with me on that. This I believe caused her to go down the path of normalcy. She took a break from facebook and came back changed.

COVID was invented by Fauci, Trump is a savior trying to stop Hollywood’s secret pedo ring, Biden is actually the devil, everything bad is socialism and communism, BLM was racist and destructive, Bill Gates is a satanist, climate change is a hoax, the vaccines will mess with your DNA, etc. Any evidence against what they believe is just “fake news” or “controlled by the mainstream media.” You guys know the drill.

I’m financially tied to them. I’m in college, and I’m very grateful that I’m in the position to have my school, books, insurance, etc. fully paid for. My parents are well off, not multi-millionaires, but definitely upper middle class. I wanna reiterated that I’m thankful to them for providing for me so well, but I can’t keep disrespecting myself and believing them when they say, “Don’t disrespect us (aka disagree with us), we didn’t HAVE TO pay for you stuff.” I guess they didn’t HAVE TO, but they’re my fucking parents. This is the bare minimum if it’s in their means, which it is.

We can’t talk anymore. Because inevitably something political will come up and my dad in particular can’t help himself. He has something medically wrong with his brain (I’m not insulting him, it’s true, I just don’t wanna go into the actually details), and his decision-making and social filter is kinda messed up. At first I would actively participate in the discussion. When they would make some crazy comment, I would do my research and then try to correct them. But, of course, it was never just that. One little comment from them and one correction from me would turn into hours long, heated, unconstructive arguments. 

My dad’s awful to argue with. He’s the yell-over someone, don’t listen, invalidate people with ad hominems, alt right debater. I’m not perfect, but at least I don’t say someone’s wrong just because they’re younger than me. You can point this out, but he’ll just say “That’s not true!” even though it got to the point I would secretly record him doing exactly what he denies. It doesn’t matter. If he says it’s not true, then suddenly it’s not true. I’ll admit, I’m jealous that I don’t have that kind of magical power.

This came to a head one day when I left the room crying and angry. I locked myself in my room until my mom, who also is a crazy Q subscriber but not as aggressive as my dad, tried to get me to come back out. “I talked with your father, and we both promise to not bring up anything political with you.” I didn’t believe it, but what was I gonna do? Starve in my room? I want you to guess how long my parents abided by this promise. A day? Two days?

About three hours.

I left and locked myself in my room again. That was last year, and now I’m back with them for a bit because they needed my help with stuff. My car’s in the shop so I have no escape while I’m in this house. I was under the impression the agreement was still tentatively in affect, even though I knew they weren’t gonna abide by it. Yeah, I’m an idiot. My mom asked me not to get the vaccine. Absolutely stupid, but not political yet, so I stayed in the living room. Then gas prices got brought up. And then there I was. “Fucking Biden did this. He’s ruining America.” I got up and went to my room again.

My mom knocked on my door and basically called me an over-sensitive snowflake who can’t bother to stay in the room when anything political came up. What they don’t seem to realize is that it wasn’t really about politics anymore. Yeah, of course I wish I could change their mind, but it’s not my problem anymore. Maybe that’s toxic of me for not trying harder, but I endured endless months of angry, abusive, gaslighting arguments that destroyed my spirit. I don’t care what they believe in anymore. I just didn’t want to hear it/get into more arguments.

No, to me at least, politics didn’t make me leave the room. The fact that they can’t respect me did. I don’t ask them for anything apart from paying for my school and living expenses. It’s a lot, which makes me question if maybe I DO owe them something. But no. They have the money to take care of their own child. They can’t keep gaslighting me into self-destructive states of constant guilt for this. 

I asked them for one simple thing. When I’m around, just don’t bring up politics. It’s not only for my own mental well-being but also because I thought it would save whatever was left of our relationship. They couldn’t do it because they respect Q more than their daughter. Maybe that’s not how they see it, but it doesn’t matter. That’s what I see.

My dad went off the wall that night. He called me a pedo-loving hypocrite. He said I hate black people (?). He said I called him “stupid” and made fun of his brain problems, even though I just said something like “You don’t understand.” He paced up and down the hallways, just yelling. Then he came back to my room and told me he was trying to inform me of stuff because I’m young and he loves me and wants me to be on the right side. He gets all his facts not from the crooked mainstream media, but from real people. People on places like tik tok and Facebook. At this point, I just nodded along and kept saying okay. This went on for 30 minutes, just him telling me all his crazy conspiracies again under the guise of “I’m just trying to inform you.” 

He calls me closed-minded, but I can’t tell him anything without him just flat out saying I’m wrong. There I was just being spewed at for half an hour. I guess I am close-minded because I just stopped listening.

The agreement is off now, not that it was ever really on. My dad hates liars and people who break their promises. He calls me a hypocrite and says what I did (vote for Biden) will destroy our family. My mom threatened to cut me off financially. But then they wanted to pretend to be a family again, so I was forced to come out in the living room again and pretend everything was okay. I was sobbing uncontrollably but after a few minutes I had to talk with them like nothing was wrong.

I don’t wanna type anymore. I’m just at this point disgusted and exhausted with my parents. I can’t escape both physically and mentally. They’re gonna keep regurgitating alt-right, Q bullshit, and I’m just gonna turn into a bobble head and nod along. I don’t have a real relationship with my parents. They’re right when they call me a liar. I don’t know that when I say I love them if I mean it anymore. It’s really hard. I’ll be back to my apartment as soon as my car is fixed.

My brother has been a QAnon believer for a while now. I didn't know but apparently he was a Trump supporter for a while too (he even voted for the Cheeto in 2016). In the last quarter of 2020, I created a WhatsApp group to try to stay in touch with my family through video calls since we all live in different states and countries. Everything was ok until he misunderstood something I said as me repeating some QAnon theory and he just started spewing shit about the satanic liberals torturing children to live forever. The rest of us were like WTF? but at that point, I didn't know anything about QAnon. Things got worse after Biden's victory when he started trying to convert us (my other brother who is an enabler who adopts an agreeing posture to his crazy talk saying ""well, everything is possible"", and my dad and I who just ignored him) telling us stuff about how Trump was coming back, or the big blackout that is coming. 

He stopped using WhatsApp because of the new privacy rules. On January 8th, after he sent me some crap about WikiLeaks through Facebook messenger, I politely asked him for him and his wife (who is a pastel QAnon who believes is an extraterrestrial being of light) to stop send me QAnon conspiracy bullshit. He simply just responded with a 👍.

Then he sent me more crap about the Pope being arrested via Signal. I just ignored him. Now he started sending me and my other brother (the enabler) text messages with links with more conspiracy theory fake news and ""experts"".

The problem is that every time I get one of these I get upset, I spent hours ruminating, I vent with my wife, who then also gets upset. I need to find a way for him to stop, but I feel that if I ask him politely again, he will simply ignore it, but I don't know what would happen if I ask him in a more rough way. I fear that if I do that it would create even more chaos.

The thing is that I want to tell him to fuck off. I want to tell him that he is using all this QAnon shit as a bad coping mechanism, to avoid dealing with the fact that he is not the young athletic free-spirited man he used to be, that he is now older than 50, has health problems, hates his job, thinks that his children are losers and that he failed as a father, and that he is married to a woman that he doesn't love. I want to tell him that he is repeating the same mistakes he did during his first marriage when he allowed a woman who he didn't love to make him believe in bullshit (at that time he even changed his religion and adopted all the beliefs of his wife). I want to tell him that he is not super awake now, he is just coping really bad.

I'm supposed to be strong and capable and not create any conflict around it in order to keep my standing in my field. It's getting more and more difficult.

I even had one colleague on our team recently who, despite my best efforts to conceal my disdain, reach out to me unprompted(!!!) to ""help me understand"" our Qolleague's ""point of view,"" even though she didn't feel that way and is *(or was?)* more aligned with my thinking on these matters.

Sorry for the length of this post. 

I am 51, divorced, and have been dating someone for almost 2 years. We have always had differences of opinion re Trump, but he wanted to avoid talking about it entirely to keep the peace. In the past 6 months or so, he has been getting angrier, quicker to lash out, emotionally distant, almost depressed. It was much worse after Trump lost the election. He didn’t talk about it at all, and blamed his moodiness on a leg injury and surgery that has kept him down for most of the last 10 months. I have been struggling to cope with his moods. In the last month he has turned into another person entirely. 

Last night he sent me a text asking if I thought we could get past our differences for the long term. I responded by saying “not if we stay on the same path...but if we can change the path, and you value me above Trump, then maybe, yes...”

He didn’t respond until hours later, around 2 am. Then he let loose with multiple very long texts that shocked me. I am not including all of their content for the sake of space, but here is the final part:

HIM: “Conspiracy theories? Look no further than Russia collusion. All lies, never proven. I will support Donald Trump in the future, as I know he will have a lot to do with the party going forward. This is not a debate about him or if he will or if he won't. I refuse to live in a household with you or anyone, it would make me want to feel bad for supporting him. I know clearing well the election was stolen, you have a fraudulent president sitting in the White House. He will wreck the economy and send it spiraling, back to the old ways of Obama, putting illegal immigrants first over Americans. 

You will always be someone that I would say to myself, wonder what she's up to these days. 

And don't give me some excuse about an insurrection on January 6th. It's awful what happened, but those were not Trump supporters. They were actors, it's been proven, I've seen the footage. I know people that were actually there and they even said they were not Trump supporters. Just remember this optics are everything.”

(BACK TO ME) I woke up with this series of texts waiting for me. I was in such shock that I just replied with a question. This is the whole interaction that followed. 

ME: Do you believe in Q?

HIM: WWG1WGA

ME: And that means...?

HIM: Yes I believe in Q. 

ME: For how long?

HIM: Probably about the last 8-10 months. 

ME: Thank you for telling me more about yourself. 


No additional reply from him so far. What I have copied and pasted here is the entire series of texts from 2 am until now, with the exception of cutting the initial texts from him to save space. It is mainly ranting about main stream media. 

The 8-10 months corresponds to his leg injury, so I can see a connection between being cut off from work colleagues and the real world, which I understand is a starting point for many Q believers. The timeline of how I have seen him change for the worse makes complete sense now. For example, he never made racist comments at all for the first year. He was actually a great guy. Then he started with racist comments here and there which I always called him out on. Now he is calling covid the China flu and other anti-Chinese, anti-Immigrant and anti-Black statements, like being against BLM. He has called me an extreme leftist (I am a moderate liberal). This is all new behavior. 

He is an intelligent guy, and seemed very grounded in reality before, so finding out he is Q is such a shock to me. It feels like finding out that the mild mannered reporter that I thought I was dating has a secret double life as a super villain. 

I am sitting here knowing that this relationship must be over. I’m mourning the person that I originally fell in love with, not this new guy. They are two different people, and it seems like it didn’t take that long to make the transformation. I want to believe that there is some kind of sci-fi parasite that has invaded him and is controlling his behavior, and that if a treatment is found to shock the parasite to come crawling out of his ear (a “Supernatural”storyline), then he (and we) will be back to normal.

... And yet despite that, he believes in some of the most outlandish shit. That Biden actually is knocking  on deaths door with dementia and at the same time perpetuated the biggest election fraud the country has ever seen. He thinks that Biden is a pedophilic trafficking ringleader.

Despite that, I don’t think he’s as far gone as others i’ve seen. 

The other day, he sent me a video of Joe Biden signing his first few executive orders. In the video he mutters something inaudible and Kamala mutters something back as she moves one of his big books to the side so he can sign the next one.

BF sends me this video in a literal panic. He says, “Did Joe Biden just say ‘I have no idea what I’m signing’ and Kamala responds ‘Just sign it’ on national TV?!?”

.... and I say no, Brad, he doesn’t. In fact, you can’t even hear what they’re saying — and even if you could, do you think they’d say that shit on national TV, where everyone could see them? 

I asked him, “What are we doing here? Are we really trying to CSI-enhance audio bullshit to try and catch Biden saying something stupid that doesn’t even make any sense? We’re being no better than the fucking Ghost Hunters shows where they put up a little phrase next to an inaudible ‘EVP’ to try and convince you they caught a ghost voice.”

He muttered under his breath and said “I guess. But I still think he’s unfit.”

He's always had a certain bias - he was uncomfortable when his daughter dated a half-black guy for a while, but he let her and was polite and friendly on the surface. I bet he would complain a lot more today. He has one black friend at work that he's friends with who he said is ""one of the good ones"" because she also thinks the races shouldn't mix, and doesn't support interracial marriage either. And she's funny and nice, apparently.

Right before the Superbowl aired, he was complaining about how they only gave it to The Weeknd because he's black, how he doesn't like Beyoncé because ""she's racist"", and she supports the Black Panthers which are ""the most racist group of all time"" (???). ""They were like the KKK but for black people."" He recently bought a Proud Boys hoodie the other day and he's been wearing that around the house, and said they had ""good ideas"" and that we should ""look them up"".

His wife and the extended family are somehow worse about it, so I guess it's not a surprise. She said, on one extremely memorable car ride, that ""slavery wasn't even that bad, it gave them employment"". About a year ago, she called her sister an ""n***** lover"" because she dated black dudes for a while. Sometime in January, she sent a qanon video in their family groupchat. It was a bunch of weird propaganda about the dawn of a new era on January 20th, how everything was gonna be different, and it ended with a Qanon slogan pasted at the bottom of the screen. 

Both of his parents voted for Trump (obviously) and convinced their daughter to do it too, a girl who literally didn't know what the word ""liberal"" meant until a few years ago AND who also had a brief flat-earther phase that lasted a good month and a half.

My main question is, are my boyfriend's parents going to get worse over the next few years, or is this gonna gonna fizzle out?

Question after this forthcoming rambling about my situation... My dad and mom are about to turn 79 and 74, respectively. They are not directly involved in QAnon online, simply due to a lack of awareness of how to access those resources. However, they are undying, major 100% Trump supporters who espouse the same beliefs as QAnon. Deep state government... Pedophile ring (and Joe Biden is a pedophile)... The election was rigged/stolen... The Capital raid was Antifa—the media just wants us to THINK it was Trump supporters... The COVID vaccine is a government tracking device. COVID is fake—deaths are overblown. And my parents are both immune to COVID, anyway—the doctor gave them hydrochloroquine and told them both they’re now immune! And so what if my dad has a heart condition and Type II diabetes— he just had his annual physical, and the doctor said he was very healthy! A few months ago, my dad was talking about how face masks don’t do anything. I responded by saying the next time he has surgery, to make sure he insists that the surgeon and all of the surgical staff DO NOT wear face masks. (Finally something that made him stop and think for a minute.) And me having a personal secondhand connection to four COVID deaths? There was something else going on with those deaths. 
Me and my mother have had a strained relationship for 15 years, anyway, so with her, I just roll my eyes. But this nonsense has virtually killed my relationship with my father. I’m the one who is clueless. I’m the one who doesn’t know what I’m talking about. I’m the one who is blind. Going to college (27 years ago...) turned me into a liberal.

Because my parents aren’t personally involved directly in QAnon, I get it that resource might not be viewed as the right one for me. My feelings will not be hurt if I am told that. I just thought this might be a good place to start and that someone might be able to give me some direction. I did read the rules, and it seemed like I could start here. I apologize if I misinterpreted anything.
To anyone who has gotten to this point, thank you for your time.

One of my best friends for years has been completely sucked into the Q cult and has cut off contact with me. What makes it even worse is that our 9 year old daughters were BFFs and now she has cut her daughter off from mine as well. 

She's always been a ""crunchy"" or natural parent, which I am also to a certain extent, and this I think led her down the rabbit hole of being anti vax. Then Covid came along and she was alternating between ""it's not real"" and ""it's no worse than the flu"", and completely anti lockdown and masks. (Ironic, since she homeschools her kids and hardly goes anywhere.) She really boarded the crazy train when she started talking about microchips in the Covid vaccine and following it up by diving into the pedophile thing and strongly supporting Trump even after he left office, plus too much more to list. She unfriended me months ago on FB when I told her she was nuts for talking about microchips in the vaccines, but basically all her posts on FB are public so I've been keeping up with them periodically. She quit posting on FB for a while (I assume she moved to Parler) and then came back right around the time Parler shut down.

I'm just really sad. I'm mourning her like someone who is dead, except if she had died I would still at least be able to see her kids! Her husband I think is not Q, he's always just sort of let her have whatever crazy schemes/ideas she wants while not getting sucked in. But I can't really contact him because I don't want to put him in the middle between us. I think I'm saddest for our daughters, who don't deserve to be caught in the middle of it all and should (imo) be allowed to at least talk online and play games together.

I've been really hesitant to share my story until recently because I realized my desire to stay private and calm for my sanity and safety is no longer worth shielding when it comes to watching people go through the same things I did. I was raised in a violent cult and escaped less than a decade ago. **IT DID NOT START THAT WAY**. They rarely do. They fade to violence to test a person's loyalty more often that not (several tiers up from the recruitment process). This is also where many people leave, but only after they see the impacts their violence had on their loved ones. By then, the damage has been done. Violence against the self is the common starter (they need you to tear yourself apart, become unworthy of their love and 'membership', so that 'you' can be rebuilt in their image) and then it moves to violence against others, both mind and body. 

I still have huge and deep scars on my body that remind me, daily, of what they people are capable of if crossed in the wrong way. This is all very familiar to me. I went through many years of recovery, still suffer flashbacks and dissociative episodes, amnesia, etc. Because I am well aware of this cult and how it's running the same course as many others that have become violent, I wanted to take a few minutes to share links to resources from the toolbox of some of my specialists that were shared with me. They helped me escape, stay grounded against attacks, and still help me with my recovery.*\**

Just a reminder to those that are in houses with QAnon members that have become abusive or violent (especially if you've chosen to not follow), this has **all** the signs of a dangerous cult. Just because they're friends or family does NOT mean they won't harm you. Things are done to a person's brain inside these cults, they utilize methods of 'turning off' empathy, they use isolation as a tactic to separate you from your loved ones (especially if they've chosen to not follow), they use a 'devalue' and 'discard' tactic to keep you within a circle of people 'approved' to socialize with, and so much more.

DIVIDE AND CONCUR is the main method, because if you're reminded that you love that person, you're less likely to 'turn off' the empathy that's required for you to then harm a person. We have seen this before in history books and it's working the same way. Denial will be your main coping mechanism to handle this, but it's also the emotion that will keep you stuck.

I just quickly wrote this out, sorry if there are any typos or broken links. I cannot talk about this topic for long, so I've got to go. Love to you all! Stay strong, practice your critical thinking, practice grounding, stay informed on the methods these cults us to recruit, trust your gut, etc. *xoxo*

This time I would like to offer an idea for those of you who are thinking about abandoning your QAnon relative, whether you have tried alternative methods to help them out of the cult or not. Honestly, you know your situation and your loved one best, strangers like me on the Internet can only speak in general terms and hope that our ideas might help. Take it all, try what you think might work, but you do you.

**The power of the Letter**

Indulge me for a second while I prattle on...

Years ago, when I was a struggling art student unsure what career path I should work towards and living on a diet of cigarettes, cheap beer and pot noodles, I considered a commercial graphic design path and did a little work toward it. My tutor looked at my portfolio and said 'You need to be different'. I didn't know what she meant at first, I thought 'Great, she's told me to completely change my artistic style', but she explained that the people hiring someone like me are looking through a thousand portfolios just like mine and if I want to get over that first hurdle I needed to stand out.

If you're trying to connect with the family member sucked into Q you're competing with a thousand online voices all yelling and screaming things that your loved one either wants to hear or feels driven toward. 

Chances are if you attempt to talk to them about this they'll spiral quickly into a well-practiced tirade, regurgitating all the posts they read that day, calling you a 'sheep' for not agreeing with their unfounded beliefs, comparing sourced and documented reality to what their Facebook friend they've never met told them they read on a forum and how that must be true because... you can't get a word in and if you could they probably wouldn't listen, because they don't want to.

You end up thinking you should just abandon them to their new cult, for your own sanity.

As I said before I was once on the side of abandoning them because it's too much work even for trained psychologists, deprogramming someone is A LOT to take on.

My opinion is that you should at least try a few things, and if nothing has worked and you can no longer communicate with them, finish with a letter.

And yes, I mean an actual, hand-written, physical letter in ink and on paper. Why? Because that stands out. It's personal, you put effort into it, it's not just another screed of words on the internet like this wall of text. They actually have to physically open it, away from their screen, away from distractions, and see the written words you have sent them.

They can't delete you, they can't block you, they can't shout you down, they can't run away. Sure, they could just rip it up, but you and I both know they'll read it all first.

**What to write**

First of all, don't attack them. Don't belittle their beliefs. Don't accuse them of anything.

Be honest. Tell them that you love them and that you miss them. Tell them that you're scared. It's okay to let them know that their behavioral changes have been frightening. It's okay to admit you've had to distance yourself from them for your own mental well-being or to protect your own immediate loved ones from what they've become (note: don't call them a threat to your kids, make clear it's about the person they have become and that your responsibility is to your kids etc). Tell them that you've tried to talk to them and it hasn't worked, that you've spent time wondering how you can help them to come back to the people who love them but it doesn't seem possible without their willingness to do so.

You can probably think of a lot of things to say to them that you haven't been able to without them cutting you off or shouting you down. **Just remember to be loving and understand that they are a victim in all this, too.**

Next, detail how your separation is going to be. Whether you're completely cutting them off or mostly distancing yourself from them you owe them an explanation of what this will mean. I would personally set a six month or one year time frame in which things might change and you might be able to reconnect again, if they've moved on from where they are now.

If it's your parent, especially if it's your mother, maybe suggest nine months of separation. It's not subtle but it could have a real impact. This could trigger the various emotional memories they have of carrying you and it might nudge them to remember what their priorities were.

Give them an opportunity to change. Don't give them a deadline but say you need this time before they make contact again, and that they should only do so if they feel they have moved on from the person they are right now.

You don't need to say that if they don't change in that time you'll be gone again. This is suggested already and writing it would sound like an ultimatum or threat, and that won't help anything.

Finish with a memory.

Think long and hard about something you both shared, a vacation, a party or a family meal. Try to think of something they can connect with, rather than something that you connect with and might miss the mark with them. Remind them of a happier time and tell them that you'd like to get back to that one day but you can only do that if they're willing to.

Offer resources for them. These people do not believe they are suffering from a mental health crisis, but they most certainly are and you're not serving them well by ignoring it. If nothing else it gives them an explanation for what's happened and being honest about it shows them that there's a way to progress through it. Don't come right out and say it, but just provide a few URLs for online mental health services or groups like this one.

I wouldn't recommend sending them YouTube video links of others who have left the cult, most of these are produced by outlets they will immediately reject. In addition, you're sending them right back to YouTube where the algorithm is ready to deliver another ten videos reinforcing their delusions.

**Stick with it**

You need to stick to this (unless in the case of family emergencies etc). If they call or text you immediately do not engage with them. Don't answer the phone. Block them if you have to. If you do answer you will probably face another barrage of abuse and nonsense from someone speaking entirely from a place of anger.

Engaging with them in this way will serve no purpose and will likely undo everything you are attempting to do by sending the letter.

The letter is you making clear that the separation has started.

You probably should block or unfriend them on social media. They'll have a desire to lash out and be vindictive at least for a while. It would be better if you don't give them that opportunity and you absolutely must not respond no matter how much they might try to bait you into it.

Ultimately if they can't scream at you on Facebook or send you a hundred text messages they might resort to replying by letter. This is okay. They'll probably go through ten drafts starting with a screed of rage before resorting to something more rational. Depending on your loved one it might be possible to continue writing letters, but I think in most cases you'll find yourself throwing them away or just not wanting to open them.

Don't let them simply move the abusive relationship from Facebook to USPS. Hold your ground and if they start writing you letters filled with conspiracy theories and emotional blackmail stop opening them, write on the back 'contact me in 9 months' (or whatever time you initially set) and send them back unopened.

Your relative might make contact after only a week, or a month, and say they're done with Q. I don't mean to sound harsh but you probably shouldn't believe them. A lot of these vulnerable people will want both worlds and believe 'they can change' (seem familiar?)

The truth is that change takes work, will power and the use of available resources. They probably haven't truly attempted to move on at all and just want things to continue the way they were when you were unhappy and scared to be around them.

Stick to what you set out in the letter.

**In conclusion**

Writing letters takes time, it takes thought and effort. A fast paced argument by text or over the phone takes no time at all and allows for things to be said that are coming from a place of anger rather than genuine considered opinion or long-standing emotion.

It's harder to ignore a letter.

It's near impossible to resist opening and reading every word.

It might work. They might get in touch again when you've suggested it and be an entirely different person. A lot of former Q adherents are seeking therapy. Many have left the cult. The social network landscape is changing and it is making it harder for these factions to indoctrinate new people.

The pandemic will end and we will start getting back to our lives and filling our time with worthwhile things and it's likely that as that happens your relative will start to realize what they've done to their relationships.

Think about it, when life starts getting back to normal and they begin thinking about going out to dinner, hosting a party or going on vacation, they'll probably realize how many people they've lost.

Always be there for the loved one who gets out. It might not be tomorrow, it might not be in 9 months, it might take another 3 years, but be ready to welcome them back when they finally see the light.

Yesterday in a text, my Qmother asked me if I've had the vaccine. I told her that I haven't yet and I asked if she has. She tells me that she isn't going to get the vaccine because it ""messes with \[your\] genetic code"" and asked me to please not get it. This made me so angry because 1) during the summer she cried in a group text about how she's going to die if she gets covid; 2) she works in a nursing home; and 3) the misinformation she believes in is dangerous because it puts herself and others at risk. I also knew it wasn't worth debating with her anymore since she's not open to new information, she never listens to me anyway, and she's just going to gaslight me like she always does.  

 I told her:

&gt;Are you doing this for attention? Validation? You should know by now that I'm not going to validate your QAnon conspiracy theories. I take these issues very seriously, but there's no point in debating if you're totally committed to your beliefs despite all the evidence. I know you're aware the virus can be deadly, so I hope you would do what you can to keep yourself and others safe by getting vaccinated.

I had to set a boundary and I wanted to bring attention to the motivations for her behavior. She has a   
 history of exploiting me for emotional validation and I refuse to play that role for her. Predictably, I knew she would get mad. I just didn't expect her to literally disown me lol.

This is how she responded (all in text messages):

&gt;What the hell did you respond to my question like this for? Who do you think you are talking to??  
&gt;  
&gt;I am your mother, I can be concerned for you because I happen to love and care for you  
&gt;  
&gt;This reponse is bull shit! Ppl at my work are having reactions that are sending them to the hospital!  
&gt;  
&gt;Why do you think I asked you. So you can come at me with angry accusations?  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I'm a conspiracy theorist?  
&gt;  
&gt;You know, forget I'm your mother. That is what your color revolution socialist agenda does anyways. I feel sorry for you, you will be in for a terrible shock. And you know what I think, you'd turn your own family in to the Gestapo. Welcome to the ONE WORLD ORDER. I will pray for the redemption of your soul. Don't call me.

Now that I've gotten over the initial anger and hurt left by her comments, I just find them really funny in their absurdity. She even made an Instagram post that's passive-aggressively directed at me. It shows an image with text that says, ""I hate when people confuse education with intelligence. You can have a degree and still be an idiot"" (I have two degrees). The caption says ""Socialism or Communism is SATANISM. Get that straight! Elitist!"" (I'm a socialist.) In the comments she wrote, ""Don't get me started! I'm at an age where I don't give a shit what anyone thinks! You can go fuck yourself!""

I hope you can respect this, thanks!” My mom responded with a thumbs up (she’s not Q but very Catholic conservative.. she doesn’t have much interest in following or discussing politics but will lean right if the topic comes up). Dad didn’t respond for a week. When he finally did it was a deluge of comments. Walls of text unprovoked. 

He said things like, “you’re not experienced or qualified enough to debate me on these things”, “you don’t even have a clue how you’re being manipulated by censorship”, “get out of my way, you are out of my league, all of you.. you’re too young”, “you obviously don’t need me around... you might want to get your head out of the way, you’re not as smart as you think”, and he said Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero. 

My sister, who is not a Q person and whom I am very close with, finally responded, basically saying that he proved my point and that we just want a normal relationship with our dad and would like to keep politics out of every conversation. Then he said, “We can all part ways. If the world gets it shit together, then we can reset, reevaluate and see what happens, if at all even possible. None of you don’t really know me. It appears it may stay that way.” 

Sooooo I guess he isn’t interested in having a relationship with us.

What is the eternal God of creation, eternal the way Tao (in taoism)?  
What is the character of the savior Messiah Mahdi Maitreya Buddha, and how to find him/her?

I as the real savior Messiah Buddha will give you the correct answer, whether you can understand it or not is another question.

The big mistakes top secret controllers, secret societies are making is that they do not simply understand the eternal God.  
The   secret controllers here I mean those are the “Gods” and entities who   are really control the shadow government in many nations, as long as the   “referee” as well.

They  only  think the savior Messiah Buddha is a being with super power, super   abilities just like in the movie “Journey In The West”.  
They  are so  wrong because the savior Messiah Buddha is the one who fully  understand  the God of creation, the eternal Tao (in taoism).  
They do not believe a mortal human with no super power or super abilities is “above level” them.

The   eternal God of all creation has no image, no sound, is exist beyond  any  eye can see. (you can verify it in many sacred books)  
**It is a correct theory in mind.**

But   all those stupid secret controllers, societies are expecting a being   with super power, super abilities for them to see in real eyes, which   mean is not the real eternal God of creation.

If   you need an explanation of why you guys are still struggle with level   3, 4 or 5 in “cultivate divine neutral energy”), then the answer is not   lack of guide but the true is that you guys do not have the correct   theory about the eternal God in your mind.  
Some westerner people may not understand what I am talking about but the East will understand it.  
Those   groups are the one who secret helped small nations like China,  Vietnam,  North Korea win against the USA, France, Japan in physical  weapon  battle war.

The eternal   power of any beings is correct theory about the eternal God, but not   physical power, super abilities. The super power super abilities is just   like the clothes.

If you  need  any “super power” to “unlock” or to “hold” anything such as door,  gate,  swords, then all you need to do is make a fair amount of donation  to  me, then make a request in detail of how you going to use, the  timing,  etc. Then all you need to do is use smartphone, open the  conversation  with me  and show that to that “legendary weapon/gate”  before “make  your action”.

Or  if you have any  connection with super natural beings and want to verify  whether my real  eternal God power is stronger than you guys (who have  activated super  abilities power), you can use that similar method.

Stop saying everybody can talk, all are just theory.  
If   you want to “gambling” your own life, I willing to “play” with you  guys  under the observe of a super power being such as Lord Shiva.

The truth of life, the truth of creation is that simple but hard to understand.

I   share this information like a last warning for you guys to stop those   stupid actions, the time of much more super powerful beings re-enter  the  game of life is comming very soon (less than 100 days from now). If  any  of you (the secret controllers) vanished by unknown reason, then  you  guys can only blame yourself.

Feel free to send this article to top secret controllers, secret societies for them to wake up before too late.

Best Regard,

I do know that literally nothing will happen. On February 22nd or March 4th or any date inbetween. 

I don't know what the goal post will be moved to after that date, however I am sure that it will be moved. 

I also know that there is no way that she will seek me out and apologize for calling me a fool and a DemonRat and whatever else, due to me not beleiving in Q insanity ect 

And I know that i sure as hell wont seek her out to remind her of it either. She said this to me in writing, that February 22nd would be the magical day. I have a screenshot. That I will do nothing with.

She used to be someone who was a left wing libertarian. Then she started to tip toe to the right. During Covid, she started to post some odd stuff. She would post about Epstein and this cabal of celebrities and politicians who traffick babies. She would talk about how we shouldn’t believe any media since it’s organized to lie to us. She posted stuff from Alex Jones and when my dad, someone who was also friends with her, pointed out that Alex Jones isn’t reliable information, she unfriended him. This one day she posted on instagram of her face painted with symbols, and the caption was talking about how she will help destroy the evil forces hurting children. She would talk about how she was awakened and everyone else was blind.
Recently she posted something about Mark Zuckerberg being a reptile. I pointed out that calling a Jewish person a reptile is extremely anti-semitic and is rooted in far right propaganda. She replied saying that her belief of a reptilian race that planted seeds for civilizations predates any organized religion, so she wouldn’t stop calling him a reptile.

Q: so I noticed the hooters over by X went out of business. And then I saw they're putting something new in there. Which is weird. 

Me: I mean restaurant spaces are generally taken over by new restaurants due to the equipment and layout and stuff. 

Q: then I noticed that a new comedy bar is opening up.

Me: that's actually really cool...

Q: but it's in the middle of a ""pandemic"" restaurants are going under with this shutdown. Who is investing in restaurants???

Me: well lots of people fund their own restaurants, plus there are lots of grants and loans out there right now...

Q: no no no, these people have some kind of knowledge. Stuff the rest of us don't know about. Some kind of plan we aren't in on.

Me: COMPLETELY changes the subject and quickly ends conversation

Knowledge? Like the knowledge that there's a fucking vaccine? Like the knowledge that shit is already opening back up again? Like the fact that restaurants constantly open, fail, and close.

The concepts behind Qanon are not new. [Qanon really is a Nazi Cult rebranded](https://www.justsecurity.org/72339/qanon-is-a-nazi-cult-rebranded/).

I have lost several friends to Trumpism and to Q. All were normal average 'center/left or center/right' in their politics.

Over the last 3 years I've learned that there are really only two approaches. The first requires a huge amount of time and 'deprogramming' and can't really be done from a distance. It requires cutting them off from the constant flow of lies through (mostly) online media they consume, and cutting off the communities they join, especially facebook groups.

The other approach is difficult, but the only way for relationships that are less formal, like friendships. You have to cut them out of your life. Accept that there is no longer room in your life for them and move on. I know it sounds harsh, but it's the only thing I've found works for more loosely bound relationships, and often close ones, like family, as well.

Why can't you just shake them out of it and make them see how insane they sound and act?

The reason is that Q is not just recycling lies from a century ago that also took hold then (and still lingers), it also uses cult formation techniques that make it particularly attractive to the way humans process information. It's inclusive, and flexible, with a base set of beliefs so people have 'a truth' what they call The Plan, but also allows them to make it their own (i.e. making up a conspiracy theory like Democrats are manipulating the weather in texas) and it's a self reinforcing community amplified by social media groups (not unlike this one, but for evil).

I'd like to think I'm wrong on this, but after dealing with half a dozen relationships (family, friends and S.O.), I don't think there's any other ways to fix it.

My heart goes out to all of you suffering through what's, for many, horrible loss. I know the feeling well. It's not unlike having that person die in some ways and, sadly, I think we have to treat it that way.

Some of them may eventually come back, many will morph into some other extreme belief system (I suspect many will end up in edge-case evangelical churches over time), but they're effectively gone. I'm so sorry if reading this and believing it to be true (as I do) hurts. I wish I'd know this 3 years ago though, so, I’m putting it here for people to take or leave as they see fit.

Life gets better, and the hurt and pain of loss goes away with time.

Also will have mentions of homophobia and abortion.  I'm open to Advice but mostly venting

My family is full of very kind, but emotionally unintelligent people. They're not very good at communicating about feelings, especially not confrontation. You know the John Mulaney bit about how people keep their feelings in their belly and one day they'll die? That's my family. 

The older members, ie born before the 80s, are the most like this. Us younger ones are doing better but. Oof. Our older generation is not. You need that for context. More context you need is their relationship with Catholicism. We are Irish Catholics who came from Ireland, landed in Pittsburgh, and never left. Most of my family worked in the steel mills, when the air quality here was still something out of a Dickens novel. They went to churches where they were encouraged to fully and completely trusting of their priest, the Bible, and the Pope. If your priest tells you being gay is a sin, of course you believe it. These are churches that have graveyards ""for the unborn"". I remember being a child and being given a set of rosaries where the beads were little fetuses in wombs. Yeah. it was fucking weird. These are people who believe that heaven and hell are physical places. Babies who die before being baptised will go to hell. Transubstantiation is a real thing, not symbolic. 

That's most of the background. The most trouble we are having is with my great aunt, and one of her adult sons.Great aunt is, to be blunt, not the brightest. But she was not raised in a way that encouraged critical thinking skills, you can't blame her for that. Two years ago, she lost two of her sisters within 3 weeks of each other, very suddenly. It absolutely crushed her. And now because of Covid she is really suffering re social isolation. I don't know as much about her adult son, but they've both always been such fucking kind people. Clueless sometimes, but so kind. When I came out it was no big deal to them. They've shown compassion to my cousin who struggled with addiction. They're the kind of people you can call in the middle of the night when you're in trouble. 

But now they've gone fucking bananas. I feel like QAnon has taken these kind, vulnerable people, convinced them that there are children bring kidnapped by Democrats, and it just spiraled from there. When you believe that bread and wine PHYSICALLY TRANSFORMS into the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ, it's not that big of a logical leap to be convinced that Joe Biden tortures children for their hormonal energy or whatever the fuck. I can almost GUARANTEE that they don't understand the horrible racism, antisemitism, etc involved in QAnon. Don't get me wrong: they are participating in these things, and it's Wrong of them. They're adults who can make decisions, and they're choosing to be fucking awful. 

But if they were just shitty people, I could just write them off as shitty people. But it's not that simple. I've lost my loved ones to a cult that manipulated them. It makes me so angry, all the time. Sometimes I think about my Gran, and how horrified she would be by her sister's facebook posts, glorifying Trump as a savior and saying the election was fraudulent. 

I've very much taken a ""detach with love"" stance. If they ever want to leave that shit, I'll welcome them back. It's important for people in cults to know there is someone on the outside who loves them, otherwise they'll never leave. But it's been heavy on my mind lately, and I've been ranting to my boyfriend about it constantly. That's not fair to him, so here I am.

Conservatives have to find a place to come together and distance ourselves from the Qult.  They are a disease and the infection is spreading.  This is an area maybe even the left and right could find common ground on and work together?

Christians using scripture to back up these lies are either deceived or are only professed Christians.  Pastors and priests also have to unite in denouncing the Q movement.  It is not Godly, nor does it mirror any of Christ’s teachings. 

“Q” posts were first on the website called 4chan.  This site is also known for child pornography.  Qpeople are against child trafficking, yet they follow a man whose beginnings originated in a place conducive to child abuse.  

Lin Wood is playing them as fiddles.  This man actually claimed to be Christ as the second coming.  Legal briefs are filed with the Court that go into more disturbing details of things he’s said.  You can also find pages 9 and 10 of the Georgia Bar grievance to be equally disturbing.  He holds daily pity parties via Telegram and then regularly sends his “Army” of “digital soldiers” after people, including his own son.  He also published physical addresses of the people seeking to disbar him.  It appears to be a way to distract the Qultists so that they don’t rise up against him for all of his past lies, particularly about Trump remaining in office.  If he is disbarred, I fear this will only fuel the Qultists, as he indoctrinates them daily about it being politically motivated and ultimately tied to child sex traffickers.  He is laying the foundation to be a martyr.  

Simon Parkes believes his mother is an alien and that he also fathered a hybrid alien child himself.  This man is occult.  

Christians should know better.  These are not Godly leaders.  It makes me wonder if this is part of the strong delusion that God says he will send, where even the elect will be deceived.

Where are other conservatives and Christians like me?

She:  Lets watch Fox TV.

Me:  Sure.

She:  Covid is a conspiracy.  Virus was built in a lab.  China is bad.  Masks are killing people.  Soros is evil.  So are Clinton, Biden.  Gates is trying to convert people to bots.  Vaccine will alter DNA.  BLM, Antifa, Radical Left are destroying this country.  Democrats &amp; celebs are pedos.  CNN, NYT, ABC, CBS.....are bs.  You like NFL?  I love Dana P. and Greg G.  Lame Stream Media is all bs.

Me:  Hmmm.  Lamestream?  That was Palin, no?

She:  Facebook is bad.

Me:  Yes!!  {There is hope}

She:  Trump is so Christian.  Look he has Bible in his hand - 'this sends shivers down my spine'.  Isn't this amazing - he's going to save us and humanity.

Me:  Who?  Donald?!

She:  Lets buy food, guns, ammo, candles, batteries, water, gold coins.  Lets bury the food in 2' deep soil outside.

Me:  Who's digging?

She:   I love my country.  I'm a patriot.  All traitors will be executed (sic).

Me:  Are we still in 21st century USA?  Who uses 'Traitor' and 'Executed' in serious conversation?

\----elections, inauguration etc-----

She:  Elections are stolen.  Fox is also bad.  Dana P has turned.  Mitch M. is also a traitor.  All traitors are revealing themselves.  Lets watch Newsmax &amp; OAN.

Me:  Is it legal to charge $5 for utter crap?

She:  Rudy, Sidney, Li are gods!  They'll find a way.

Me:  Did he just fart?

She:  There will be blackouts.  There won't be any inauguration.  Trump gets second term.  Army is going to arrest everyone.

Me:  I'm working remote.

She:  {crying - tears streaming down her face}   There's no God!  (sic)  Why else would Biden be President?!

Me:  {consoling}  It'll be alright.  {secretly hoping this is the end of this phase}

\---Ten days later---

She:  Did you know that USA is a corporation?

Me:  What?!

She:  Yep.  Trump will be inaugurated in March.  USA and Taiwan are sending forces to get rid of Communist Party of China.  Xi is really a friend.  Trump put Flynn and his brother in charge before he left.  They will save us.

Me:  You effin Whacko!  Get the eff out!!  I have work to do!

As time went on, my father slipped more and more into his iPad. It became nothing but a Facebook machine, the holding place for the echo chamber. Content systematically delivered to find into the fringe things he started digging into.

He's from a generation where the news was more trusted. Where not everything was a blatant opinion piece, doling out strictly partisan politics and us versus them ideologies.

As the 2016 election went on, he already was a pro Trump guy because... Well, his reasons were copy pasted from news sources. Crooked Hillary. Benghazi. She's a career politician and he's a billionaire business man.

Then he started pandering Sandy Hook conspiracies and I thought this guy is really going over the edge.

I remember the day he casually said, ""One of the pages I follow on Facebook, this Q Anon person said....""

And I'm in my 30s, grew up on the internet and yeah even 4chan. I knew what it was. God, wasn't it obvious trolling and incitement? Wasn't it so clearly just bullshit?

I don't support either party. Nothing but crooks, too much money in politics. Class division is the true unfought fight in our world.

I tried to temper him, reading him Trump quotes out of context and watching his brain short circuit when I said, ""That was Trump who said windmills cause cancer."" He would huff off, knowing the jig was up but too much at battle with cognitive dissonance.

It got to the point where all he did was respond with Q talking points and corporate for-profit news bullshit. I could predict what he would say, because it was all that predictable and just utterly programmed.

I tried to tell him this and he told me I was brainwashed. Just like when I said I wasn't for Trump, he put it on me that I must have been for Hillary. He couldn't compute that I don't support any of this type of garbage. I watched him fall apart from a good man with a sharp mind into just another parroting qultist.

He started treating my wife poorly, despite her having no such interactions. She was guilty by association. In July 2019, my wife asked him to walk her down the aisle at our wedding, because her parents are not with us. We mutually cried and he accepted.

In August, he lost it. Told me I was brainwashed. Started treating her like shit. I told him we were done and that he would have to come before me like Christ himself to apologize to my wife for ruining our family and our wedding.

Nothing. We were pregnant at that time, and he didn't know. I shared the news months later. Nothing.

Our daughter turns 1 year old this weekend. I have not seen or heard from him since August of 2019. My parents, both alive and well, were not there for the birth of my daughter. They won't be there for her first birthday. They're nearing 70 and both smokers, so I don't know if I will ever see them again.

Maybe like others, I was foolishly hopeful that the election cycle would shake a lot of this off. But the truth is, we've been calling them cultists and the election cycle doesn't effect that. I have no doubt he would have traveled to DC on Jan 6 if he was physically able. I have no doubt he thinks Trump will just reappear in the Oval Office in March like these people are saying now.

I often say that the people in our lives will show us who we want to be.... And others will show us who we must not become. My only solace is the standards I have as a father and husband are informed by this.

Just another story, same as so many. Thanks for providing a place I could write it down.

We have fought over politics (and reality itself) for nearly a year. He talked about how ‘the left’ and ‘liberals’ are ruled by their emotions. But I walk on eggshells never knowing what topic I might want to talk about that he somehow connects to all the conspiracies and would get triggered and start ranting. When he starts that, hearing himself say the things he believes gives him a hit of dopamine. He spins himself up on the drug, getting louder and more angry the longer he speaks. He can’t hear anything around him. When I try to get a word in, he doesn’t let me finish a sentence. He makes an assumption about where my sentence is going and that it disagrees with him, and to prevent the cognitive dissonance and discomfort of hearing something that conflicts with his views, he interrupts and starts on a rant again.

The progress I made last night had absolutely nothing to do with addressing the conspiracies. I talked to him about how we communicate, and his habits around talking with me. I told him how he behaves and what he does. 

And he doesn’t do it to just me, he does it to his best friend too. I talked to him about how he projects what he thinks I think onto me, without actually listening to what I have to say. I talked about how he spins himself up and seems high and crazed from this essentially drug. I talked about how I walk on eggshells because he gets triggered by topics I thought weren’t political at all. I talked about how there is no space in the relationship for me- only his ideas, his beliefs and his ego. None of this had anything to do with QAnon or the beliefs themselves.

The group also includes two teenage daughters of a friend. For illustration purposes here, I’m going to call him Jake. All 15 of us are natives of Southeast Asia and live here. 

Recently, I’ve realised that Jake has become more vocal with conspiracy theories. I’ve met him for drinks a couple of times with the intention of catching up. These catch up sessions however, I’ve realised, tend to pivot progressively to something a bit more “evangelical”, where almost always, at some point, I get “preached” to about about some sort of conspiracy theory. I tend to ignore them unless they are COVID related. Even then, I ignored them at first as just a quirk of Jake’s. Then, I started getting private texts. It was at first from Jake, then another friend, and another. All of which supported some sort of ridiculous theory about COVID. 

I’d like to think that I’m quite educated, am well-read, and because I am a bit of a stickler for facts, tend to cross-check the information I receive across multiple credible sources or news sites. However, as conversations with Jake progressed, he started making me feel as though I was arrogant or not as well read as I thought I was. He also started sharing conspiracy theories about COVID being a scam on our gaming group chat more frequently. 

That was when I drew the line and started replying to provide different perspectives that contradicts his COVID-related conspiracy theories on the group chat. 

I did so because I understand how dangerous conspiracy theories can be, and how easily one can get rabbit-holed. It has serious real world consequences, especially in uncertain times like these. So, personally, I’ve made a socially conscious decision to speak up whenever someone spreads conspiracy theories, especially when it relates to COVID, instead of enabling them further or allowing that behaviour to be normalised. 

Some of my friends who like me, don’t buy in to these conspiracy theories think that I should “let Jake be Jake”. That I should be more tolerant. 

I disagreed. 

I did what I did because it was driven by three intentions:

1. I was not looking to change Jake’s views. I’ve had numerous interactions with him and have tried different types of approaches to change his beliefs. Unfortunately, I honestly think that he has gone too far down the rabbit hole. I’ve accepted that it is highly unlikely that I would be able to convince him to change his belief. The only reason I responded to him was because he was sharing disinformation about COVID being a scam. I posted what I did because there are two teenagers in that group chat. His daughters. 

2. My “target”, although it may seem like so, isn’t Jake. It was his audience. In this case, his two daughters, his best friend and the rest of the members in the group. I felt that his daughters and best friend may find themselves to be more invested in changing his perspective than I do. For me, selfishly, I am more invested in preventing others being drawn in to conspiracy theories than I am in the person spreading it. I had shared an article from Healthline on the psychology of conspiracy theorists in response to a couple of videos Jake had posted which perpetuated a view by one Dr. Simone Gold which drove disinformation about COVID. He had manipulated the fact that she was doctor to justify it as truth. This act of mine however, I feel, did kill the group chat’s vibe. Jake has also gone silent on the group chat. 

3. However, if my action discourages or silences one person from sharing a blatant lie or false theories that has no scientific basis whatsoever, then maybe, that’s one less act of disinformation that is contributing to potential real world, life and death consequences. It’s a bonus outcome I would welcome with a clear conscience. I can’t help but hope that there are many more out there who share my intentions and do the same when it comes to conspiracy theorists. The same way most people would speak up against racism, sexism or violence. Because to me, disinformation about COVID, is far more dangerous than those three combined, especially in the middle of a pandemic that has killed millions.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,134231,public,confidence,self,"I recently stood up against a conspiracy theorist in front of his daughters.

Anyone absorb any podcasts, articles, twitter threads, videos that made you feel a little more knowledgeable on the subject? or maybe less alone? This subreddit has been helpful in and of itself.

I'm you know, the daughter of two people I love so much and have always been extremely close with. I had pretty much called my Mom every single day since I left home for years, up until last year. I don't even want to talk to her anymore. The anti-vax emails, the foaming-at-the-mouth love for Donald Trump, the extremely shady ""memes"" she was sharing on Facebook and Instagram became all so incredibly hard to watch. So many of her own close friends cut her off cold turkey without explanation, won't return her calls, blocked her online, and she ""doesn't know why"". I know why. 

I am an extremely non-confrontational person. I've never broached the subject head on with either of my parents. When they start going down the Q-hole with me in conversation, I tend to find an excuse to get off the phone. I blocked them both on Facebook for my own sanity a few months ago and vaguely told them ""Oh I deleted it"". I can't tell if my ""pretend-i-do-not-see"" approach is good or just evasive and hurting them further. But, they are very smart people who have just filled their brains with garbage who I think, even if I took them head on, would think I ""don't see the truth"" and am not as ""well researched"" as they are.

That is how I would describe my husband of 35 years.  He does not follow all of the QAnon conspiracies.  He does not believe the pedophiles who eat children.  But he does agree with most of their deep state crap.  He believes the election was stolen.  He does not condemn the Capital riots, he believes the virus is overblown, he believes Trump is all but the second coming.  He  had such a fit yesterday about gas prices that his yelling scared both of our dogs into trembling.  He would rather have me avoid him at all costs, for me to spend evenings in tears over his anger at all of the ”lying left” than to admit his alternative facts do not stand up to reality.

 The part that makes me the most angry is that he does not come out as QAnon, but leans so far right these days that there is very little daylight.  We have always seen politics different.  I am a lifelong Democrat.  He was liberal when we married.  I started losing him to the far right 20 years ago.  That’s when he started listening to Rush Limbaugh on his truck radio all the time.  Now trying to talk to him is like talking to Rush or Hannity or any other Fox idiots.  To me, Q is an evil poltergeist, made up of all of theses ranting, angry morons.  They spew hate and rage and stoke fear.  Words have power! They are ruining families everyday with the hate and bigotry they vomit out.    


I wonder if I can sue Fox if all of this costs me my marriage.  Probably not.  Fox and QAnon walk hand in hand.  They will lead your loved ones down a dark path you may not be able to follow.

My name's Jill, I just found out about this subreddit today from an article on Politico and wanted to post/vent about my uncle, who is falling progressively deeper into the whole QAnon hole.

As background, my uncle used to be a pretty moderate guy politically. He may not have been a genius, but I never thought he was dumb, gullible, or anything like that. Things really started to change though during the Great Recession. Like a lot of people he lost his job. Around the same time, his marriage fell apart and, ultimately, he had to declare bankruptcy. He started blaming then President Obama for his problems and the fact he was not getting back on his feet as fast as he felt that he should. After talking with my mom and other members of our family, he moved to Florida, where most of them lived, both to have more of a social support system and in hopes of having more opportunity for a job than in the shrinking midwestern city he had lived in. Although he kept drifting rightward politically, there still wasn't much of a sign that he was falling in with QAnon until the last few months.

Predictably given the scenario above, he was a HUGE Trump supporter. Everything he and his prominent supporters said was the gospel truth regardless of facts to the contrary. When more mainstream news sites started not giving him the take on things he wanted, my uncle started drifting to more extreme sites peddling conspiracy theories, edited videos, and the like. Suddenly, everyone to the left of Trump was a dangerous Marxist and a member of Antifa (including my wife, my mom, and I, all of whom did not buy into Trumpism or these conspiracies) out to destroy his country.

So, its important to point out three things here about myself and my life. 1) Although I identify as a trans woman now, I did not at the point in time at that this next part takes place and am still not out to my family yet, 2) my wife identifies as a member of a religious minority in America and my uncle knows this, and 3) I have a doctorate in an area of public policy. Things started taking a hard turn and our relationship strained when he decided to post some things on social media defending white supremacist groups who had actively called for harm against Jewish people, Muslims, and people of color in our country, often implicitly but often explicitly. I pointed out to him just how much this hurt considering his nephew, who he supposedly cared about and was definitely a part of his family, was married to someone who was being targeted by these groups. I told him I was appalled that he could possibly defend and agree with people who, given the chance, would kill my wife and any children we hoped to have. His only response was that he was looking out for his family and that I needed to do more research like he did if I actually thought the mainstream media was telling me the truth about these groups (proceeding to link me to an opinion post on Scott Adam's blog).

That was kind of the start of his slide. From there, his social media became full of reposts and retweets of articles supporting QAnon causes or from actively Q affiliated accounts. He started asking for Q's take on other articles he found, seemingly in all seriousness. Although I can't necessarily prove it since my uncle is really the only member of my extended family who is active on social media, but I think he pulled in more of them with him. Not that we would have gone given the pandemic, but my mom, wife, and I were noticeably the only members of my family not invited to Thanksgiving. He also went no contact with my mom for a long time, believing her to be a traitor for voting for Biden. I've similarly gone no contact with him after he posted a slew of QAnon related articles following the attempted coup in January, trying to belittle what happened, blame it on left wing agitators or the deep state, and the like.

All that said, its just sad that all of this has happened, I see no way to pull him out of it, or signs that he will come back to reality. I'm glad that my wife has a strong connection with her family and that my mom and dad do not subscribe to this cult, but I wish my future kids would be able to connect with some family on my side of things. I'm an only child and, barring things changing unexpectedly, I don't think I'd feel comfortable letting any of my extended family near any of my future children. Especially once I'm out, I know I'd likely be excommunicated from that part of the family anyway since transphobia runs deep there as well, but still, it'd be nice to at least have someone I'm related to who isn't a part of this cult.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,134176,public,confidence,self,My Uncle (Just me venting),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lnn49z/my_uncle_just_me_venting/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I posted on here around the inauguration and I am just back to say that since then I have had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine and I am ok. No bad side effects except tiredness and sore body. 

My Dad has emailed me various Q-based things insisting that the Vaccine will make me sterile, that I don't need it because I am young and healthy, etc.  He continues the same exact rhetoric, using the same language. There is nothing individual or even remotely reminiscent of his Old Self.

She really struggled with the fact that both sets of parents did not believe the same things; her therapist said that it was hard for a child's identity formation to have to change their belief system each week when they transitioned to the other house. 

In the past several months, though, she has turned a corner and is skeptical of what her QAnon parents believe in because she has been able to identify their hypocrisy, their inability to listen to her and her feelings, and how bizarre their beliefs are in comparison to literally everyone else in her life. 

She doesn't like being at their house. She'd rather live with us. But she doesn't want to say this to them because she crumples whenever they are upset with her. She can't withstand their anger enough to be able to say what she wants. We haven't initiated any custody proceedings because it would cause so much emotional distress for her to be in conflict with the other set of parents, and we think they'd pressure her into saying that she wants to live with them. 

However, we're waiting until she gets old enough to be able to tolerate the discomfort of being in conflict with them. Still, the custody laws in our state are such that unless they are physically abusing her, it's hard to get full custody.

Is anyone else going through this? I just don't know anyone who's dealt with this. We feel very alone when it comes to this issue. When we talk about it to other people, they are in shock and disbelief about our story, which isn't really helpful. Or they say we should just get custody, and they don't understand that it is not likely we'd ever get full custody and they don't understand the harm it would do to our child to go through a pointless custody battle. 

In the meantime, we just focus on modeling healthy relationships, emotional boundaries, and accountability for our child. We talk with her about her feelings, help her process what's going on, and encourage her to call us if anything scary ever happens. But it's really hard to see her have to go through this.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,134072,public,confidence,self,Sharing child custody with QAnon adherents,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lnkjrb/sharing_child_custody_with_qanon_adherents/,some_ads,7,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growing up she was all into Nostradamus etc... In 2000, she bought pallets of water etc...

However, he is VERY anti liberal, yet face to face he is a very nice guy. However, he has no balls as he lets his own kids run all over him etc...

Anyway, I don't want to make this longer that it needs to be. Early 2020, my mom didn't even like Trump. However, by the time the election came up she went full hardcore Trump. We had some discussions throughout 2020 and I watched the conversion. I tried to fight some of it, but it went nowhere. She never really called me unless she needed something, usually technical, though the latest ones were more about how she could hide her money so she can stay on Medicaid 🙄. The hypocrisy knows no bounds.

She is 60 years old and she is on Medicaid, yet I don't think she should even be eligible. She had a ""cough"" and they gave her disability? Yet she rants all the time about ""blacks"" who are too lazy to hold a job and take advantage of the government. How does she not see the hypocrisy? It is 100% what she is!

Anyways, every single call with her ended up being converted to political. She said I never called her, which is bullshit, she just never answered. Yesterday was the final straw. She went into how the election was stolen again and I just hung up on her. I texted her afterwards with this.... and I probably went overboard, but I give up. I dread even talking to her now. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I'm done, don't call me anymore. I said before to stop this bullshit. Go join with your QANON cult and eat up their bullshit. The reason gas is going up is because of OPEC cuts  + increased demand as the pandemic is having less and less impact on decreased driving and also refinery shutdowns in TX. Not a pipeline that was never even built. But keep blaming what the boogeyman fox tells you to. You are so gullible you'll believe anything fox tells you. The fact you STILL think the election was stolen when everyone else admits it wasn't except trump and a few fox talking bobble heads is so stupid. TRUMP LOST DEAL WITH IT!

I just need to vent a little.  My mother has been deep into conspiracy theories for as long as I remember.  I think the only one she didn't buy at face value was Bush doing 9/11 and I only think that's only because she voted for him.  But she used to talk about how evil public school teachers were and that they only wanted to make kids atheists.  All kinds of crazy crap.  I grew up knowing what Christian Nationalism was, I used to know the pledge to the Christian flag.  I tell my wife this stuff and she looks at me like I've got three heads.  

When I was younger my brother and I were pitted against each other for my mother's affection.  She used to treat my brother so horribly, she beat him with a belt one time so badly that he fell and hit his head in a tub, we used to tell that story for laughs, its not funny anymore, and now I realize it never was.

Sorry, to the Q stuff, recently my parents have taken a deep dive into Qanon.  Now that I no longer believe like they do I'm the enemy now.  My brother and I are a united front for the first time in our lives and that seems to be making their ire worse.  I've tried to talk to them but it always ends up the same way yelling and crying.  My mother will start by yelling and then go straight into crying once that doesn't work (this is an old tactic and one I'm used to, it no longer phases me).

My dad's a little more receptive but every stride gets pulled back because of my mother.  My dad has always been a keep the peace kinda guy.  He'll go along with whatever my mother says.  I don't mean that to degrade him but it's true.  My father and I used to be really close.  I'd talk to him almost daily.  Now I avoid talking to him at all.  I was gonna name my first son after him, but I can't bring myself to do that anymore.

The last time I attempted to talk to them about this stuff my mother disowned me and said she never wanted to talk to me again.  She texted me this, there was clear record.  She tried to call me a week later like nothing had happened.  I told her ""I thought you never wanted to speak to me again."" She started screaming saying she never said that and that I was lying.  I read her texts back to her and she just said she didn't remember doing that.  I told her I had no interest in talking with her until she apologized.  She responded with ""fine, I'm sorry."". I told her she had to mean it.  Not just say it.  She responded with ""I didn't do anything wrong.""

I think my mother being gone into this Q stuff doesn't bother me as much as my Dad.  I miss my dad and just want him back, but my wife and I are going to start having a family soon and I can't have this insanity around my kids.

The     solutions, ideas in this article belong to me the savior messiah     buddha, you need my special permission to use it in the public/media.

There is no entity above religions.  
Religion is the best weapon to defeat the “evil”, the “stupid” beings/entities.

The next revolution of this civilization will kick off with religion.  
People     in certain nation will not just only allow to choose the religion   they   want to follow, but in near future they will be allowed to choose   the   city/town/state/nation with purify only 100% followers of each   religion   to live it.

I can see some big land immigration nation such as United States, Canada, Australia will allow that happen.

There are many various religions out there, but there are 6 major influenced religion must be in the list is:  
\- Christianity  
\- Islam  
\- Judaism  
\- Hinduism  
\- Buddhism  
\- Nonreligious/Atheist

Imagine     if one new political promise allow people to live in 100% pure     followers of each religion, it would bring automatic win in any nation     for sure !

So instead of 1 choice, now you will have 2 choices.  
Instead     of “gambling” in 1 religion in 1 society, now you can have your own     real life experiment in 100% purify religion society.

This     weapon is so big that if the West especially the USA using it  against    the East, they would win automatically. No any demi-gods,  angels or  any   entities in the game can counter it.

I do believe this is the only working solution for the USA and the West come out of the darkness.  
So I will only allow you guys to use it in the public/media/internet under this 2 conditions:  
\- Must be posted under an anonymous user on the internet/online.  
\- You guys must make donation of at least 20 million Euro to me via cryptocurrency.

I'm on the verge of cutting ties but I'm scared this would make her go deeper into this insanity. Every time I speak to her I feel like my mind is about to split in half from the BS.

I'm a 19 year old from England. I consider myself spiritual, skeptic and liberal.

My mum and her friend aren't necessarily Qanon supporters. They follow a variety of interpritation of our reality based on their personal 'research' but I question the reliability and bias in that research. Their beliefs would categorise themselves to others as conspiracy theorists but they like to consider themselves awake. 

One said she researched the pineal gland and that we have powers. 

My mum believes that the covid vaccine will rewrite everyones dna so they are no longer human. 

They also believe covid is a man made virus created by the government as a way of enforcing ""the new world order""

I am someone who doesnt like to talk on things unless I have researched them myself so I cant say they are right or wrong but the little I know about reality leads me to believe that it's most likely false information. Eg: I'm pretty sure it's not possible to rewrite a persons dna.

But the reason why I entertain these discussions is because it sounds like their is some truth to what they are saying and although unlikely some of what they say is possible. 

Eg: they believe the government is brainwashing people

Mk Ultra was a real program that existed. This is a fact. So what's to say that the government isn't brainwashing people today? 

Another example. Covid is man made 

Unit 731 was a real unit that existed during ww2 to test biological warfare. What's to say that experiments with similar goals havent been conducted since. 

I want to know the TRUTH. Has anyone took it upon themselves to research what they are saying? I have started but theres a lot to unpack and I dont just mean watch videos. I mean look up documents. Look up scientific studies. Cross refrencing research and recognising biases because I think their might be some truth to this but I want to seperate the bullshit from reality. 

Lastly, i am worried for my family. In a way the ""awake"" community seems like a cult where free thinking is falsely encouraged and anyone who doesnt believe the same thing has been programmed. 

I have had many arguments with my mum because I am some who asks too many questions in her eyes. We are not talking anymore. She thinks I'm too far gone because I had a covid test and she thinks I now have nano bots in her brain.

Has anyone been in the same position as me? What did you do? What did you find? Can you share research? And is this a cult?

I replied to his post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lmk7kj/my_dad_quietly_deprogrammed_my_mom/) describing how his father assisted his mother in escaping the Q cult but I want to go into a little more detail here as I hope it might help some people to de-radicalize their relatives.

I think we all know that the primary nodes for radicalization on the Internet today are YouTube and Facebook. This is especially true of older relatives who have found their way into communities where extremist ideas and conspiracy theories are prevalent.

Both Facebook and YouTube use algorithmic systems to keep your attention on the site. These algorithms are intended to monitor what you enjoy, what gets and keeps your attention, and then deliver more of it. This is how fanatics and other bad actors utilize the internet to draw more people into their movements.

Once you click on a video you'll see more of that content, and this laser focused delivery system only becomes more effective the more you watch.

What I will suggest here are ways in which you can disrupt this process and potentially wean your loved one out of the delusion.

**YouTube**

YouTube is almost perfectly designed for radicalization. It has one goal - to keep you watching videos so that it can keep delivering ads and making money. By its very nature it's an ideal tool for cults and extremists because it does the brainwashing for them. All they need to do is supply the media, YouTube then does everything it can to lure people into the cult, because that's its business model.

So, how do you disrupt this?

Find something your relative loves. It can be anything. If you don't know of anything then make the focus cat or puppy videos. All you need is a healthy alternative they could be watching instead, something you're sure will catch their attention.

Let's just say you picked cat videos (everyone loves cats, right? If you don't, you're just wrong, sorry).

If you live with this relative and have access to the device they use then access it yourself when you can whenever they're not around. Don't be creepy about it, don't invade their privacy, but if there's a shared PC they usually watch Q videos on use it when they're not around to access cat videos. Watch as many as possible. Click like on them, maybe even leave a comment.

Gradually you'll replace the conspiracy theory videos with cat videos. Sure, they could just search for something themselves, but how many of them searched for Qanon in the first place? Most probably just clicked a link from Facebook and that started them on the algorithmic automation of radicalization.

After you've spent a few hours watching cat videos on that shared PC when they come back to YouTube they won't see ten new Qanon videos telling them the latest nonsense to believe, they'll see ten cute cat videos you haven't watched yet.

There's a very good chance that even if they're still seeing the occasional Q video they'll start to realize they're happier seeing cat videos.

Right now they're getting their endorphin hit from the outrage and fear of Q. The endorphin hit from laughing, or even just smiling, while watching a cat knock things off a table will be a more pleasant experience.

Let the cats radicalize them away from the fanatics.

In time you'll break the algorithmic hold YouTube has over your relative.

**Facebook**

While this might be harder given that you don't have access to their account, on their phone, you do have access to their feed by sending them content.

You need to compete with the fifty Qanon cult members feeding them radicalizing material and while that might sound daunting remember that you are their loved one, the other strangers on Facebook have no real connection to them other than the cult.

If you can, team up with other members of your family and your relative's friends to organize a gradual weaning away from the cult.

Consider building a team of people who will help you with this intervention, the more you have to assist you the easier this will be. Don't try to take everything on yourself.

As with the example for YouTube, pick something you believe they'll be interested in (cat videos, of course). Agree that you'll all look for a new video every day and send your loved one the link to it on Facebook. Join Facebook groups in your chosen theme and start sharing posts from it with your loved one. Find memes to post and tag them.

Of course you need to be subtle about it. Start out on your own, but tag other friends and family in the post as you go. Just keep it relaxed ""You should see this! So funny!"" your friend or relative on the team can back it up, get involved, start talking about it, share another one etc.

Start out slow, maybe begin with just you and a friend/relative, then a week later quietly ask another to help out and tag them in on the next post, and so on.

Just make sure the friends/relatives you approach to join the ""intervention team"" aren't invested in Q also.

Gradually this will divert their attention away from the unfulfilling Q cult they have immersed themselves in, while they themselves are indicating to the algorithms on both platforms that their interests have changed.

It doesn't even take long for this change to happen. Within a couple of days there's a good chance their media consumption could completely shift from Q to Cats.

Both platforms NEED your attention. They don't wait months, weeks or even days to start delivering what their algorithms think you want to see. As soon as your relative shows an interest in a subject other than Q the algorithms shift with it, the more they then click on what is suggested the more will be delivered, and the less Q will be seen.

**In conclusion**

The algorithms on these platforms didn't have to work hard to lure your relative in. One click was likely all it took. With few alternative interests ready to intercept this programming that one click then told the algorithms to deliver more, and more, and more.

Once you start to break the hold those algorithms have on your loved one you'll probably start to see a change within days.

I'll admit that I've been a proponent of abandoning those who succumbed to the cult, because they can indeed be dangerous. However, it could take you and a few friends just an hour a day of sourcing alternative media and messaging to wean them out of this cult, and surely they're worth that.

So what do you say?

Are you gonna recruit the cats to deprogram your loved one?

She’s been sending me things about the COVID vaccine and how it’s not real or safe. She’s very Catholic (voted for Trump twice), but has been leaning more towards fringe Catholic news.

When I responded telling her that what she sent me was a conspiracy theory and that I was worried, she said, “Thanks for your concern but I don't trust the mainstream media.  I have seen the bias for myself.” I’m aware many news sources are biased, but what can I say to her to get her to just... fact check?

I don't call my parents on holidays or birthdays. I don't call them at all. Every few years when they call me, when I see it's them calling, I instantly feel dread and want to ignore the call. But I pick it up, listen politely to who's died or whatever the news is, try to make some kind of small talk that won't set them off, and hope to get off the call before it blows up.

The last time I talked to my dad I asked about a relative's old house in Flint, Michigan, and how I thought they were going to sell it, and how was that going since the water crisis. I didn't anticipate the existence of the Flint water crisis was controversial in itself - I got a whole raging earful about how there was no water crisis in Flint, Michael Moore made it up just to embarrass Flint, plenty of other cities have lead in their water, and lead isn't bad for you anyway.

Pretty sure ol' pops remembers I used to work in environmental science. Which just makes me more of the enemy, right, and he's letting me know he's on to *my* bullshit. Well, OK then. It's not Flint or lead he's really pissed about, it's that I'm a traitor.

When I was a kid, he always talked about how much Archie Bunker was his hero. When Rush Limbaugh became a thing, that became his thing. I tried to ignore it. When I used to go home for holidays I politely asked for matters of religion and politics to not be discussed over dinner, which was agreed to, and then shortly forgotten. I'd just try to eat as fast as possible and leave. I try to avoid letting them know my ideas on religion or politics, and as far as I know, they only know I'm not on their side and therefore the enemy.

And now, what would I even talk to them about? Not only is it a strain to stumble through a small talk minefield, trying to avoid a topic that'll set them off... what's left after that? There's nothing I want them to know about my life because they're only listening for something to get upset about, and if I wanna know what they have to say, all I gotta do is go look at the wackjob right-wing media of the day. It'd be nice to just hear updates on how people are doing, but if I also gotta listen to hateful bullshit directed at me, it's not worth it.

I assume they probably fell into the Q hole, but either way, I can draw a straight line of fascists and hatemongers and conspiracy theorists from Father Coughlin to Rush Limbaugh to QAnon, and it's all essentially the same thing. My family were just always early adopters.

I posted this article, [Twilight of the Assholes](https://christopherkirk.substack.com/p/twilight-of-the-assholes), on Facebook - it's a goodbye fuck-you to Rush Limbaugh. I woke up this morning to a comment on it from an old high school buddy who said he didn't necessarily agree with all of it, but he liked it, except the title was too harsh because Rush *has a family*.

I thought of a lot of things I could have responded with, but ultimately, I decided the best thing was to just delete the comment so nobody else starts arguing and try to get on with my day. He doesn't get it and I'm not going to spend my day debating on Facebook about it. But not gonna lie, it pissed me off, and here I am wasting time on it anyway, for one reason I think people here understand:

Additional background on this project is below and you can find more info about how to support this campaign on the Harmony Labs website.

Existing inquiry into QAnon has largely been driven by surveys, ethnography, and journalistic reporting yet little is known *at scale* about QAnon’s loosely affiliated community. Many people working to counter this extremism can’t afford the research they need to know where to go next.

One-off, fast-moving research projects can be invaluable to understanding, responding to, and counteracting cultural trends in real-time, but are often challenging to fund. That’s why we ([Harmony Labs](https://harmonylabs.org/)) just launched a new Kickstarter campaign to provide the research media companies, journalists, storytellers, and concerned friends and family of QAnon believers need to address QAnon online.

This research will be carried out rapidly and in full public view, with transparency of analysis, results, and datasets, and with direct input from supporters of the campaign. The project will produce a fully designed, interactive, public website to ensure findings are easy to use, accessible, and actionable. In this way, we can start equipping people with the tools and resources they need to counter Q.

She does fact check things, but she has certain websites she fact checks, and doesn’t trust outside sites.

Last night my step grandpa had a heart attack and was hospitalized. It happened late at night, so she woke me up and told me and then she and my step dad left me at home so they could meet the ambulance. The next morning I asked her how he was.

She immediately launched into how he got the vaccine so that’s what caused his heart attack. Not that he’s 90 years old and weighed over 300 lbs most of his life. She was telling me all this stuff about the vaccine and she didn’t even tell me if he was alive or dead until I stopped her and asked about his condition. He’s alive and it looks like he’ll be ok, but we’re pretty rural so we won’t know the extent of the damage until he sees a cardiologist in the city today.

The local doctor was saying that probably he had a blood clot that became loose for one reason or another, she isn’t sure. My mom is convinced that the vaccine caused the heart attack and seemed to doubt the existence of the clot as she talked about it. She was really upset only his wife, my step grandma, could go see him, and that she refused to record the doctor to show her after what they said.

It’s scary to me that that’s the first place her mind jumped. She’s normally such a smart person who doesn’t lend a lot of credence to conspiracy theories at all. We’ve had like at length conversations about internalized racial bias and the prison industrial complex for fuck’s sake.

What even can I do? It’s not like she watches Fox News or gets her info from Facebook. I think she’s scared and lost in the state of the world like the rest of us and is in danger of falling into toxic ways of coping with those feelings.

I'm a journalist who couldn't help but become fascinated by QAnon in the months leading up to the election. I rarely write about ""politics,"" but I couldn't help myself from falling down the rabbit hole of wanting to document QAnon, because it strikes me as the most important sociological pitfall of our current age. To that end, I spent months between Nov. 3 and Inauguration Day chronicling QAnon beliefs and deconstructing them on sites such as Parler and Gab. I posted that piece here a month ago and got lots of really great feedback and support. It was this piece, here. 

https://www.pastemagazine.com/politics/qanon/qanon-trump-parler-gab-conspiracy-theories-inauguration-day/

I sort of hoped that this would be the end of my spending so much time reading QAnon rants on Gab, but it didn't take long before I came to feel like I needed to do it one more time, in order to capture how the vibe of QAnon communities is continuing to evolve during Biden's actual presidency. I wanted to see how they were all coping/rationalizing/raging during this period, when any person looking at the situation dispassionately would be able to conclude that Trump had lost.

Suffice to say, the QAnon believers who are still there have just dug themselves in deeper, but that's to be expected. There are all kinds of crazy new conspiracy theories, etc., etc. But I also feel like a lot of Q believers have been dealt a big blow, and I think many of them have melted away from these communities. There's a feeling that they're incredibly fractured last now, given the lack of central leadership. Different groups within QAnon believe vastly different things, and infighting is common. It seems to suggest they'll have an increasing difficulty uniting on anything.

Anyway. Here is the result of spending the last month continuing to read thousands of QAnon posts on Gab, etc.

I just found out very recently that my mother has been becoming a Q follower over the last couple of  years and how my 65 year old dad has managed to quietly deprogram her on her own without anybody of us knowing. My mom has always believed in weird things like healing crystals but as far as I know she never went overboard with it. She was always a ""If you have a fever a crystal will help but if it's worse go to the doctor immediately"" kinda person. But she fell deep into a q hole around 2017/8. She never really talked about it with us outside of some ""deep state"" comments which don't really mean anything where I live so we just ignored it. ""It's just a phase"" came up very often. But it was way worse than we thought.

However my dad was not taking this. He, all by himself, figured out how to block websites, lock tv channels etc. This might not sound like much but my dad is the MOST dad when it comes to computers. He is the kind of dad who regularly calls me and asks how to create folders etc. He hates computers. But he spent months, literally actual months, figuring this all out by himself. He blocked Facebook and other weird Q sites (including reddit), blocked Youtube channels and replaced them with progressively less stupid ones (going from conspiracy theories to healing crystal channels and then to Opera and cooking channels etc.). He also did whatever he could to keep her from the computer, going on weekend trips and (before covid) even taking her to the Opera. My mom always wanted to go but my dad *HATES* it. I don't think words can describe how much he hates the Opera. Still does. And yet he took her there as often as he could afford it. And signed her up on Opera forums just so she would spend more time talking with these harmless people instead.   
Again, I cannot stress enough how impressive it is that my dad accomplished this. My dad who once asked me if you need the internet to receive e-mails.

I bet you are now asking ""Why didn't he asked you for help?"". Thing is, I had no idea this was going on. I see my parents somewhat regularly but again, some weird comments aside my mom never really said anything about Q. And we don't talk about politics at all. I only found out about all of this happening by accident (I won't get into details here, it's long and not that interesting tbh)

So, why did my dad not say anything? When he told me everything he had done he said he didn't want us (my sisters and me) to think bad of my mother. I cannot even describe how I felt when he said that. I'm not sure a word for this feeling exists. It's somewhere between heartbroken because we left him alone doing all this but also warm because he cared so much but also frightened because it could have all gone wrong as well.  
My mom is now pretty much back to normal and now that we know she is talking about her experiences a lot with us, even tho she is clearly ashamed of herself (obviously we constantly tell her how proud of her we are and that she doesn't need to be ashamed anymore). She has deleted her Facebook account and has completely cut out real life Q ""friends"" she met during her Q time from her life.

I'm fortunate in the sense my family has not (yet) exiled me for voicing my opinions (or rather facts) when it comes to debunking their Q related claims. For example the latest claim was ""Spongebob's address is the same as Epstein's pedo-park in the Virgin Islands!"" This was of course already debunked and upon trying to explain how several sites detailed how someone simply edited the address to that of Spongebob's 🍍 124 Conch Street via Google Maps they refuse to accept my proof and state that all of the sites or articles (20+) I used for reference and evidence to debunk this claim are ""run by the cabal and liberals."" 🤦‍♂️

I continue to try and be the neutral voice of rational and logical thinking but every time I attempt to prove their Q related claims are false the evidence is never good enough! I know they want to believe everything they read regarding Q is true because it's not only what they WANT to believe but also what they HOPE is true and fact. (Sounds like a liberal but I'll not say THAT to them...yet) Unfortunately such belief of these frivolous claims and disputing all concrete evidence is where their rational thinking ends.

Now it's their belief/hope (or let them tell it: what's GOING to happen without a doubt) the Supreme Court is going to overturn the election results this Friday 2/19/21. After reminding them the SC has already dismissed several states cases regarding election fraud they then proceed to claim the military will overturn the election if the SC doesn't. They also believe the military is in control of the country, Biden is incarcerated and speaking from a movie set within a cell (possibly Gitmo from what they gather) it's the usual Qniverse claims that have mislead so many others already. Of course if none of the above actually comes to play out then ""Trump will be inaugurated come March 4th!"" 🤦‍♂️

I will still continue to be the neutral voice of reason and rationality, but what more can I do to try and get them to drink less of the red Kool-Aid, pop fewer red pills, and start RESEARCHING some of these claims made by Q or others in the internet? As I said, just because you believe it's true and hope it's truth doesn't mean that it's actually true! But I honestly don't know how to go about getting them to fall back and straddle the fence by researching BOTH sides of the story before automatically jumping to the conclusion it's 100% fact or going to happen solely because it's what they WANT to happen and be true.

I've already labeled them Qanon Casualties (which they hate because Q is law) but in the same breath I have a slight feeling of hope because come 3/4/21 when nothing happens and it's just another day I'm hoping they realize 'hey...maybe Q was wrong and not everything Q claims is true.' Only time will tell but I have hope they will start to return to their senses and think RATIONALLY once they realize they have no choice but to accept the reality they're living in and stop believing everything they want to believe on the internet is actually canon and fact just because they want it to be true and play out. Nothing but a false sense of hope and security!

TLDR: Fam believes literally everything Q says is fact and true because it's what they want to be fact and true. But they don't research anything and refuse to believe anything that contradicts any Q claims even when the evidence or debunk is concrete solid and proven fact.

I was expecting a longer form to complete but as soon as I filled out the topic, ""Chiropractors promoting vaccine skepticism"" I hit next and got a message saying thanks for the tip. We will be in touch if we need more information. Woops. I provided no specific details.

If they reach out I'm thinking it's ok to say:

*""My father recently texted the family a very concerning anti-vaccine video that he said was from his ""doctor"". I looked up one of the clinics he visits which is actually a chiropractor's office that promotes anti-vax sentiments. I think he is referring to his chiropractor when he texted the video. I am not accusing anybody of anything and I don't know for sure that this chiropractor has actually scared my father or others away from getting vaccinated, but they are promoting anti-vax messages and debunked and/or banned from YouTube videos on their website. I thought it was something newsworthy and important that there are health professionals promoting anti-vaccination misinformation during the pandemic. Please do what you like with this information I'm providing and keep this tip anonymous.""*

I **DO NOT** want to accuse anybody of doing something I cannot prove such as sending direct to clients bizarre videos about the vaccine. I do not want to slander anybody or damage their business with something I cannot prove and might be entirely wrong about. I do know what they have to say about vaccines on their very public website though. 

It may be this chiropractor's right to promote vaccine skepticism and if it is, so be it.  But he is pushing anti-vax info on his website so that's public knowledge. Maybe he even thinks it's good for his business?  A ""health"" professional promoting anti-vax views at this time is pretty newsworthy in my opinion and if he gets shamed into keeping his vaccine opinions to himself in the future then that's a win. If he's breaking any regulations then shame on him. 

The bonus is that I accidentally tipped off the station my father watches in the morning.

I feel a little guilty, but getting called out could save a life or two. And yeah, they also promote a lot of other pseudoscientific services and products that are bogus.

&gt;My family immigrated to the US from Italy in the 30’s. They worked in the mines of Appalachia because this was the work they knew and were skilled at.  Fast forward to the second generation… Our family has been split down the middle by QAnon. Some of us chose to continue the families love for adventure and exploration by traveling and extending our boundaries beyond the borders of WV and Pennsylvania, and some decided to stay. The ones that left, are mostly left leaning moderate Catholics who respect all cultures and religions, it’s just how we were raised; however, the ones that stayed behind, adopted a more local mind set and political views. Now, I have no animosity toward family members staying local, but mention this only to give context to the current Q situation within my family or clan.  The Q mythos has completely absorbed a good portion of my family. More the second generation than the first. The first generation still held true to the ethics and values of their parents. But something happened to the second generation, they became more nationalistic, xenophobic and racist, completely forgetting where they came from. I attribute this to the lack of struggle and pain our grandparents felt.  Enter Q… about half of my family has gone to the dark side but the worst has to be my Q-ousin and his wife. They have never, except for an occasional trip to the Outer banks of NC, left the borders of WV. They believe deeply in Pizza gate; the election was stolen and anyone not a trump supporter is a communist satanic homosexual pedophile who kills babies to drink their blood. I am ashamed and astounded that they really believe this!  I can go on and on but the bottom line is that Q preys on the weak and uneducated (Nothing to do with formal education) … the ones who have never experienced outside stimuli and cultures.

I've faced the similar struggle as many of you of losing a loved one to conspiracy theories. I'll spare you the details about how it's negatively impacted me. But I just made this burner account to post here because today, I came up with a rough idea that could possibly help pull our people out this mania. 

Like many of you, my lost one's ego and livelihood is fueled by ""doing research"" and ""knowing things"" that other people don't. ""Sorry sheep, I'm on a different level than you, you haven't read the papers or done the research,"" they've told me and others close to them. Today, they texted me yet another disoriented bitchute video about why we need to fear the covid vaccine. After watching, and politely refuting a few points in the video with medical journal research available online, I came to realize a few things about how/why they consume misinformation and how we could possibly combat it:

1.) Many of these people will not trust or consider things that are not on media channels like bitchute.

2.) They NEED to feel like they are discovering information themselves that ""other people"" don't know about.

3.) Clickbait titles that scream ""Oh my god!!! X is going to happen if Y and no one is talking about it!!""

4.) The life values presented in the videos are valid much of the time.

Each conspiracy theory video appeals to their values, like freedom, which many sane Americans can agree with and relate to. These values are totally valid. For example, the antivax video I got sent today opened with a solid philosophical argument about informed medical consent, which is important. However, the problem with antivaxers as you know, is that they are not properly informed. So we could take a ""get informed, don't let them give you the jab without the facts"" approach by click-baiting them into \*actual\* research on their preferred channels. For example, we could upload actual educational videos with clickbait titles to bitchute with legit videos about how vaccines work. Like scare the shit out of people into actually learning something real to pull them out. ""They don't want you to know Pfizer's mRNA vaccine does THIS to your cells!!"" And then the bitchute video can be an immunologist first appealing to their values describing how it's important to have informed medical consent/freedom and then can go into the specific science about how mRNA vaccines actually interact with your cells.

Do you think posting on their media channels in this way is a good idea? Why or why not? What holes am I missing here? What other ideas do you have related to this? How could we go about something like this?

Hello friends: 

I am a communication educator at a small community college in Hillsboro, MO. For reference, it’s about 30 min south of St. Louis. For promotion, I am completing a second master’s degree in New Media Production. For my Master’s thesis I wanted to create something that would help people, so I am creating a documentary, and I could use your help. 

While there has been reporting on Qanon and the rift it’s caused within families, there has been little work on how we might work to help bring people back toward the middle of the political spectrum. I’ve enlisted a group of social workers to help me with specific tactics that we can teach to family members who want to try and help reach their Qanon/extremist family members. 

Here is what I am looking for if anyone here is interested: 

\-People willing to be interviewed through zoom on the effect that political polarization has had on you and your family- This can be from anywhere as I can do this through Zoom.

\-People in the Greater St. Louis area who might be willing to undergo training from these experts and are willing to then reach out to their family member using the skills

\-Information on any other experts or people who might want to speak with me

If you want more information on what would be involved in the documentary, or if you have any other questions, please message me, or if you like, you can email me at [lisamariepavia@gmail.com](mailto:lisamariepavia@gmail.com)",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,132879,public,confidence,self,Documentarian-Would like your help,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lm7p9m/documentarianwould_like_your_help/,some_ads,7,#dadada,dark,,,,,,,,6eaaed9a-e7f3-11ea-b0aa-0e5b7e0af0d1,,,,,,,,,,

However there is a hate growing in some of these threads for anyone right wing and a growing culture that assumes everyone right if center is part of Q. May I just remind everyone that these are our neighbors and friends and family members. My roommate is still struggling with Q, my parents are spouting things that clearly originated from Q even though they don't even seem to know what exactly Q is. 
These people are not going to just die or disappear so beating them into the ground with hatred is only going to push them further away, I like my roommate even if I dont like his politics, I want to be able to put politics aside and just be friends, and even more than that I want to be able to discuss political views, agree or disagree, then put it away when we are done and be able to still see each other as morally gray, imperfect people who have been the hero and the villain in different situations through out their lives.
Here's an exercise that's healthy to try: think back and try to remember a time when you were the bad guy, times when you were wrong and would not admit it. Can you imagine fighting passionately for a cause that you think is for the greater good and then come to realize you've been part of something ugly or even evil? 
The cheering of Rush Limbaugh's death is an ugly sight, he was no angel but certainly not evil either, and I'm surprised at how it becomes ok to hate someone who's views are problematic even when they are dead dancing on their graves like it's some great victory. I'd expect that response to the death of Ted Bundy but not a political commentator, even if sometimes he was outright wrong, even morally wrong to say atrocious things. 
I invite everyone to think of a person as a 4 dimensional being. A physical, mental, spiritual and time dimension is a jungian way of seeing people. Theres the you from 10 years ago, the you today and the you that could be tomorrow or 10 years from now. 
People need to be allowed to make mistakes and come back from that with acceptance, if they admit they were wrong and you throw it in their face they will never admit to being wrong ever again and they wont listen to you either.

But something about the way he talks in his videos makes me genuinely emotional. I almost start crying if I try and watch several of his videos back-to-back. He's so dreadfully deep in Q. The way he talks, the way he titles his videos, the descriptions on each video, the way he replies to people in the comments, everything about him hits so hard and I don't even know why.

Some of his beliefs are:   
Pepsi and the NFL both worship Satan,   
Ashli Babbitt was a paid actress who never actually died,   
Biden never rode in the real Air Force One,   
Mike Lindell's ""Absolute Proof"" video was gospel and it was removed because it was the ""truth,""

pretty much everything you'd expect.

I think most of all I'm just crushed by how much of a victim he is in all of this. He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about at all in these videos. He's definitely just parroting whatever he hears from whoever he wants to hear.

He very much reminds me of my father, who is also neck-deep in Q as well.

Hello Everyone. I'm just hear to vent about how Qanon has completely taken over my sister's life.

My sister and I didn't always have the easiest relationship. She was definitely more emotional, took things personally, and acted on emotions and a bit paranoid while I would always joke around, not serious (which annoyed her but also other people in my family) be more logical, and try to put everything in perspective and find a solution. This is not to say she didn't have great qualities, she was also really funny and we would sometimes be going back and forth with jokes that left our family laughing for hours. She would also care a lot for animals and people and didn't let people bs or lie when she was around.

But as grew older we grew more separate (like most siblings) I studied in America and she did as well but she came back to the Netherlands a year before me to study her Masters and I did the same as well. I only started to see a change in her when I came back and she came to visit me. We were just talking and she just starting about being Christian and how abortion is bad. Now that wasn't a red flag or anything for me but it was very surprising because our family was always non religious and the closest person being religious was me growing up somewhat following Islam. But I thought fine if she is happy then I'm happy and the rest of the trip went fine.

What happened next came more from my mother who expressed concerns with stuff my sister would tell her. I didn't it myself because we would usually make jokes with each other and never get serious. She was telling me about how she was becoming more anti vaccination and that she didn't believe the world was round. So when they visited me again during dinner I was very surprised to hear it myself because I didn't believe it and that also she believed that they were using aeroplanes to kill us. I remember distinctly her saying that she doesn't believe anything NASA says but then I said ""you know other countries have satellites in space as well right"" and she went quiet because she didn't have an answer for that and she added that there was a plane that had shown data that the earth wasn't round but then I just said""10s of thousands of planes fly every year around the earth, wouldn't they see that then as well"" I also went on about how gravity and physics wouldn't work how we know it then and that was the end of it. She didn't have arguments for it so I thought it was done. My mother and I talked after that about how strange that she would think that especially since they were so different than what she believed before.

A lot of things happened inbetween including multiple shouting matches with backing Trump and talking about how democrats are the devil and also backing a politicalparty here in the Netherlands that is big into conspiracy theories but the breaking point was with something that happened to me. While I was living in America I had a bad encounter with the police and with myself being black and the other person being white and almost being arrested myself for saving a woman from that guy but luckily there were many witnesses who supported me and shouted to the cops what really happened (don't want to get real into it) So when George Floyd happened I decided to share my story on facebook. I went to my family (including my sister) to help me formulate my story so it wasn't confusing. Now I told this story to my sister years before and she believed me then and was fighting for me but she has changed her mind. She was talking about how perspectives are different and that her perspective was different from mine. Well that was complete bullshit since she wasn't there and that was just another way of saying I don't believe you anymore. I'm not a shouty person so I just told that I don't think we should speak anymore. I haven't spoken to her since then and I really don't plan to. One of the things growing up that we both really struggled with was race and how having a white mother and black father was being too white for the black kids and too black for the white kids. She was so adamantly anti racist and was always my voice as my big sister growing up against it. And for her to turn on me on one of the most traumatic things I have experienced was too much and I couldnt do it anymore.

My mother still holds onto hope that she can reach her and every time she talks to me about her I try to support her and not show my true feelings that I think she is gone. My sister is almost 30 now with no job and no real plan to get one and still needs my parents to help her with the smallest things. Not sure if she takes care of herself but she has no friends and just talks to this boy from Texas and said that she would move there. I really only get emotional now because I'm afraid by the time my mother passes away my sister will be in the same spot or worse and that she couldn't save her. My mother is honestly the sweetest person in the world and I don't want her heart broken.

My dad and I have been at odds for the past 4 years over Trumpism, gradually getting worse each year. However these last couple months since Biden was elected and took office, I was beginning to see a light at the end of this dark MAGA red tunnel. My dad was more himself and filled with less hate, negativity and skepticism. Things were looking up. He recently won his battle with cancer a couple months ago and had his last chemo treatment in the fall. He is eligible for the vaccine and was excited about it - even had his appointment made. Then last week he watched a viral video from Simone Gold (America's Frontline ""Doctors"") and now has changed his mind. It was a 50 minute long video about how the vaccine is experimental (like of course it is? most of medicine is) and how it can cause infertility and then *casually* mentions government tracking (OK). My dad sent this link to me and it only took a quick google search to find out besides spreading vaccine misinformation, she was also arrested for being involved in the capitol attack (shocker). I sent various links to these articles and all he did was get mad at me. 

He was never on the full QAnon train and really never bought into conspiracies before. He watches Fox News but doesn't have any social media. He's normally practical and on the positive side of everything. He was a big Trumper but him not accepting defeat with grace - and then the Capitol attack really opened his eyes (though he would never admit it). He's middle of the road, not too far down the conspiracy rabbit hole yet. Does anyone have any tips for debunking a doctor like **Simone Gold?** Or have had any similar experiences with **America's Frontline Doctors?** I can't believe this is the first I'm hearing of this organization or group or whatever they are. 

My intent isn't to trick him into anything, I want him to WANT to get this vaccine and to see the truth again but it is a constant battle against misinformation and his friends who believe in this shit.

She has tried to convince me not to get vaccinated, my sister has called me a pedophile, and before the inauguration they tried to force me onto signal because they were convinced we would lose contact. The two of them have shrivelled away into paranoid, angry, and delusional people with no sense of reality. My Mom doesn't work, she's married to my amazing father who has supported her with a very comfortable life for years. And yet she's acting like the end of the world is upon us. It's infuriating to see someone who is so privileged acting like this.   


I'm despondent because I live in Mexico and have not seen them in quite some time. No one except for my father calls me to ask how I'm doing, how my job is going, whether I'm healthy, etc. The only time we have contact is if I call them, in which case I have to bite my tongue the entire time. My father has expressed that the situation with my mom is really bad -- for the first time in my life I wonder if there's a possibility that they will divorce. There's not much for them to talk about anymore.   


We thought that after the inauguration they would calm down. But in my last conversation with my mother I could tell she still believes ""something"" is going to happen. My question is, what the f\*ck do these people think is happening in March? I try to follow along through resources like this reddit group, etc. It helps me to know what they think is going on (despite it all being crazy) so that I can prepare myself for the commentary. Does anyone know?   


I'm so tired of feeling this despondent. And angry! I almost have to disassociate sometimes because when I think about it for too long I start feeling awful things toward people I love.

He wanted to join the proud boys but when I pointed out they would hate him (he's Chinese) he said I was getting brainwashed by my college and liberal media and that if I had two brain cells to rub together I would know that he was right. He didn't like it when I pointed out I would have more brain cells if he didn't you know smash my head into a window breaking it once and abuse me regularly as a child. Obviously it wasn't safe so I had to move out to live with my mom who luckily was already divorced.

Here's the kicker: my mom is a q believer. Although she is a better person than my dad, she saw this as an opportunity to get me to see the light. I'm just absolutely exhausted by everything. This isn't the first time this has happened, my dad and I had a fight on election night as well and I ran to my mom but she and the rest of my family convinced me I was overreacting and that he didn't mean it, that me telling him he was being racist was the same thing as him telling me to become a who /// re. And as soon as I go back, this happens. 

At this point, I'm just numb. I'm not even upset that I just got disowned by a parent. I don't even see him as a parent anymore. I'm absolutely disgusted at this man and I have no sympathy for him at all. I even feel cleaner after being disowned.

I can't even 100% say that the video link originally came from the chiropractor. I wouldn't put it past my father to link two semi-related things and send it out to others. It's not OK for a medical professional to send something like that out. I don't know if I can report them for what is on their website plain as day, or if that vaccine skeptic material is OK in my state, CO.

Here was the text sent to me and 5 others - *“Please, please, please listen to this as if you're life depends, on it, because it does. Sent from my Dr. to me. Please do not take a COVID test and especially the vaccine*!🙏❤️🇺🇸 

The Dr. my father refers to is most like his chiropractor, not an MD,  that runs an anti-aging and regenerative medical center. His website features anti-vax articles and attached to some  ""Freedom"" websites, videos starring Dr. Judy ""Plandemic"" Mikovits removed by YouTube, and videos from elsewhere. I know about the chiropractor and anti-vax connection already. I'm planning on calling the state medical board and regional chiropractor organization, but I don't have proof he sent anything directly to my father. 

 From the forwarded video:

&gt;  *""It's not a vaccine but a cellular GENETIC MODIFICATION technology, admittedly designed to give those ignorant enough to take it........ a self-creating AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE similar to what used to be called.......AIDS""* **COVIDS** transhuman, nano-technology, eugenics driven democide and genocide. We have all been duped by germ theory. Bill Gates is turning us into walking, talking cellphones, something about a horrific brain parasite and the nano-particles are apparently alive and will fight each other. And that's just the test. Mind control and DNA manipulation. 5G frequencies. Crypto slave wages.   **THEY ARE LITERALLY GIVING YOU AIDS.** 

Below is anti-vax content from the clinic website. I'm not sure what the state's laws are for chiropractors (D.C.)s regarding medical misinformation. The chiropractor is pretty comfortable putting this out there as pragmatic skepticism. The video I watched was something entirely different. 

&gt;As a healthcare professional that has been in private practice for almost 20 years it concerns me that our medical freedoms are under attack and our right to make informed medical decisions for ourselves and our family may be taken away.  
&gt;  
&gt;Imagine how you will feel when the day comes that you cannot make your own decision about a medical procedure being performed on you, your spouse, your child, your parents, your siblings!   
&gt;  
&gt;What is wrong with asking questions?  Why is it so difficult to have an ‘objective’ conversation about vaccines?  Why are we not looking at who is funding the research that is being pushed down our throats? Is that research industry funded?  Are there significant ‘conflicts of interest’ by the researchers or investors of the research?  
&gt;  
&gt;The point is, get involved in learning as much as youcan so you can make a more informed, objective and less emotional decision.for you and your family.  You just might be surprised at what you find out…..and you may help to thwart an attempt to take away more of your medical freedoms!

I have very little experience with Reddit.

I've always had a toxic and abusive relationship with my parents but it was ultimately politics and conspiracies that dragged us down to the point of no return. It started with them flipping out about BLM, to BLM being antifa, to antifa and pedophiles destroying the country,  etc etc. This would start the moment I would walk in the door, from my grandmother and dad. I would have to leave the room or nod my head in silence to keep the peace. Sometimes I disassociated. The only reason I kept going over there was so my kids [3 years, 11 months] could see their grandparents. The first time my grandmother started acting out against them was the last straw, though- I decided at that point that I wasn't taking them over there anymore, which made me into the villain. There was a talk with my mom because we wanted to try to fix it but then the gaslighting and excuses for their behavior started and I realized that I lost her too. My brother is mentally disabled, so it took them no effort to feed him their conspiracies and turn him against me. Just like that, our bond was gone and he stopped talking to me ... he was the one I protected and cared about the most.

It's been 6 months since I last saw or spoke to them. I thought I would be feeling at least a little bit better by now. I don't regret cutting off communication at all because it was for mine and my kids wellbeing ... it's just that they weren't even the slightest bit upset that I left, and I think that's what hurts the most- like Trump and Q were more important than me and I just became the crazy, misinformed disappointment.

 Growing up in a small rural farm town, I couldn’t wait to leave for college. I remember life before 24hr news channels, and it was a much more simple time. My family would watch Dan Rather at the end of the day, and that was most of the news we would consume aside from the Today show in the mornings waiting to leave for school.

Sometime around the 2000 election, Fox News was always a fixture on the TV, ever present during dinner, breakfast, always on... and it got worse after 9/11. I remember getting scolded for changing the channel to MSNBC, “you liberals...”. I always loved my mom and step dad, and felt bad for them when they reacted like this. Similar to when my stepdad stopped me during dinner one night when I was discussing how I learned that dinosaur fossils were millions of years old, only for him to “remind” me how the Earth was only 5,000 years old, and those fossils are tests of faith. 🤦‍♂️ 

I give all of this to you as context. This was my house growing up, and I somehow survived and broke free. 

My family had pressured me into joining the Navy to pay for college, and I had never truly felt that was the path for me. I was more interested in music, and played guitar in a metal band during high school. And yet, I found myself at the Military Entry Processing Station (MEPS) and inches away from signing my life over to the military. I froze, dropped the pen, and said “I’m sorry, I just can’t do this”. That setup one of the most awkward days of my life, having to sit in the lobby with other recruits while waiting to head back home (5 hr car ride, recruiter picked a few of us up). I was also the last to be dropped off. 

This was a departure from my family’s control over me, and where I finally started to assert myself and my views. Needless to say, things were never the same with my parents. As I went off to college in 2007, I didn’t understand that would be the last time my family would be whole. 

My mother’s health started to become an issue around 2009, and she was growing apart from my step dad. I had made a lot of friends at college, and I also had a job keeping me in town over the summer. I started to feel more at home in my college town than I did traveling back to the town I grew up in. 

2010, parents were divorced after an ugly couple years, and my mom was on her own for the first time since I was 3 years old. I also found her becoming more and more fascinated with conspiracy theories, and vehemently anti-Obama. This struck me as odd, as she was never so vocal with such hateful rhetoric. I’d grown used to the Fox News parroting, but this was on another level.

After college, I found work in another state on the west coast and moved with my girlfriend and son in 2013. My mom seldom would visit, although I would make it back several times a year.

Fast forward to 2015, and I’m getting very excited about Bernie Sanders, especially because of my moms poor health and her struggles with preexisting conditions and coverage. I called her to ask her what she thought, and was taken back by how enamored she was with Trump. It didn’t make any sense to me, this man was horrible with the things he said in public, and had no real policy from what I could tell. Never the less, my mom did the condescending “oh son” bit and I decided to not get into it. To my absolute horror, Trump won the Presidency. 

My Facebook feed would constantly be filled with hateful fascist rhetoric from my mother and likeminded family. I couldn’t keep quiet. I had to say something, provide them links to facts. Somehow I had to show them they were being fed lies. This only served to disconnect me from them further. I was somehow “indoctrinated” from going to college and daring to read books. 

My mom was now taking my sister to Trump rallies every time he would visit the state. They both wore their MAGA hats, and again to my horror, chanted “Send her back!” In regards to Ilhan Omar, and yelled obscenities at the local media covering the event (which my biological father was a part of and in attendance).

2020 was so bad. The worst. My mother eventually blocked me on Facebook, and started telling family how she was “worried about me being radicalized” behind my back. My mother was immune compromised, had several bouts of chemotherapy, and was a smoker of 35+ years. 

I was paranoid she would get COVID, and sent her a box of 50 bottles of hand sanitizer after furiously refreshing on Amazon for hours. She was proud to not wear a mask when she went out. She even called me one day to vent about how she was “accosted by 3 elderly ladies in Walgreens for not wearing a mask when pickup up my prescriptions”. My mother had Graves’ disease, and was not taking care of herself.

She was absolutely convinced that Trump would be arresting the Democrats and winning the election in a landslide. Except that didn’t happen, and I think it really shocked my mother. The election was called that Saturday after Pennsylvania was projected for Biden. My girlfriend and son were dancing, and it was a truly happy day here.

Two days later, I wake up to a bunch of missed calls from my sister. Mom had died early in the morning that Monday. She had a “thyroid storm” and her body couldn’t take it. I flew over and helped my sisters clean up her apartment, and that’s when I learned how truly bad everything was.

We found her blood pressure monitor, sealed in the box, never used. Empty packs of cigarettes everywhere, even tough she told us she quit years ago. She had a QAnon phone case, a WWG1WGA sweater, and a collection of MAGA hats. I was floored. This had consumed my mother, and all came crashing down.

My sister is even more of an adherent to this QAnon cult since mom passed, and I am truly worried about her. I don’t know what to do, or even if it is worth my time. We are trying to plan a memorial for my mother, and my sister calls me the day after the Capitol riots and vents about how “Antifa stormed the Capitol”.... I told her she is living in a fantasy world and that I can’t deal with her at this time.

He's miserable, I can tell. Last time I was at his house, he was smoking heavily, talking about how he hated everyone, talking about how he was spending money he didn't have on buying more guns, and eventually tried to kick me out of his house only to beg me to stay when I finally had enough. His neighbor, one of his best friends, basically told me in a private conversation that he was done with him too because as the neighbor put it, ""he's not well"".   


On my birthday in October, he called me to... I guess, wish me Happy Birthday but ended up calling me a demo-drone and demo-rat after I asked him to stop talking about politics TWICE. Eventually, I had to cut him off (which I actually rarely do because I don't have the strength to say no to him usually-- but hey, I think Trump finally killed my last bit of love in my heart for him, so Trump did ONE good thing) and tell him, ""You know, I'm trying to have a happy birthday despite everything being closed... and talking to you is making it really hard to do that... so I'm gonna go... have a happy day... without you.

I tried to call back and hilariously (and because everything always has to be on his terms) it said my number was blocked. I know my FB and email are also blocked.

I wish you well and hope you can find happiness somehow, but after what happened in January in Washington DC, I don't consort with terrorists.   


HIM:  Still under the glamour of those scumbags I see, that's why I new it was a mistake responding, oh well. Instead of happiness I wish the truth upon you, don't worry you won't hear from me again.    


ME:  Again, I'm asking you to leave me alone. You scare me. I don't like whoever it is you've turned into with your guns and extremism.

He was very adamant about it and he seems to know you best. We both agreed you've become violent these past few years and have a paranoia streak going and have become obsessive about guns. I'm afraid of you. I've never been afraid of you before, but I am now and I'm asking you to just leave me alone please. You're not the person I loved. He's gone. I hope you figure out your stuff though. Truly, I do. We've had our differences before, but this is different. I have to stay away from you because I'm afraid you'll hurt me. I'm sorry.   


HIM:  I new it would be a mistake to attempt common curtesy, I didn't send you a rocking chair, you sent it to me. You are a brainwashed fueled by your fear the perfect puppet, a tool to destroy democracy, you cry about inequality but never think that you have set up a world of slaves and inequality. Lies, guilt and fear are all you deal in. I was feeling sorry for you, now I know your lost.  This is the last you will here from me, but some day you will know what a fool you have been and I wish you no mercy in your despair.  As for me, I have no regrets and have found happiness and true love in these dark times. I feel pity for future generations a race of slaves will be born.  PS stop trying to pretend you know anything about me, your warped sense of reality is the most dangerous thing their is, guns are not as dangerous as a bad idea, and you an your cronies have been doing your best at destroying freedom and democracy but like all tyrants your time of judgement shall come.   


ME:  Goodbye \[his name\]. Don't contact me again. I honestly wish you hadn't the first time too. I don't love you anymore. I'm sorry.   


  
It's just.... ugh. I also have this photo of him from years ago that I keep thinking about. A car had gotten into an accident in front of his house because he lived on a busy road. I had my camera in my hand and decided to take some pictures to see if I could help them with insurance, ect. In the photo, everyone is rushing to this flipped car to see if the person is alright, while he's just standing there going through mail he just got out of the mailbox not even looking up. It's just that level of lack of empathy that I really think was there but that Trump and his alt right goons preyed on.

I have reason to believe that my soon to be MIL is q. I have always knows she is conservative but having grown up with conservative family members this seems extreme to me. A few examples are she posts videos claiming that public officials are faking there covid vaccine. She references forces that are causing things in very criptic ways and her FB friends have said she is”awakened” she has also made several comments about how Bill Gates is behind things? I am not sure what that fully means.  Interestingly enough she has also in the past year suddenly become religious (christian) which I find interesting. I grew up Christian so its more so the sudden aspect that really surprises me.

I do not like her and she does not like me. She is an anti-masker and my partner(her son) called her out on it recently and said that they are important. She said basically ”says who” and he listed my parents who are scientists in the medical field. She got very upset and said my parents and I were spreading fake news and basically we are part of the problem. Then called him and screamed that he should break off the engagement because “I lied about being sick” I survived a tumor several years ago that lead to many surgeries which my partner was there for so I would have had to really go to a lot of lengths to make that up.    We agreed we would stop speaking to his mother and focus on our relationship which was good for a few months.

Now I made it very clear I think she is out of her mind but Its his mom and I am not going to stop him from having a relationship so they began talking again.

However, he has since then dropped his support for Duterte, not because he prefers to kill drug abusers instead of, I don't know, offering them rehab, but because he has ""allied himself with communist China."" I believe that not everyone is perfect, but what my grandpa (and the rest of my family) seems to lack in their otherwise unassuming and polite personalities, they make up for in espousing the most outdated and harmful views bordering on conspiracy, hence the ""almost Qanon"" title. I have watched my family change from typical immigrants who get their news from a healthy mix of different news sources to exclusively watching OANN, reading Epoch Times, and watching god knows what on Youtube.

Youtube is a godforsaken website. It has an algorithm notorious for trapping people in ideological echochambers. The emergence of alternative news media seems like a good thing on paper, but these internet news channels aren't obligated to the same amount of fact checking as those on the mainstream media. If you already hold the same ideas as the person spreading the news, there is a good chance that you won't question what they are telling you because you have a confirmation bias. Most of these alternative media sources are free to spread conspiracy theories to an unquestioning audience. The crazier the conspiracy, the more attention it gets.

 The algorithm is also easy to manipulate- people with enough money, who otherwise would never be aired on TV because of the conspiracies that they push, can pay for ads on youtube and mass produce videos at a faster rate. The result of this is channels such as China Uncensored and PragerU, which are gateways to alt-right conspiracy channels such as Stefan Molyneux that push the Jewish Question. I am not white, so I don't need to worry about my family becoming Nazis, but some are at greater risk. 

What's even worse is that when you tell them about this, *they'll accuse you of watching the fake news when they are being fed disinformation day in and day out.* 

These are the consequences of ""doing your own research"". There are traps and pitfalls every step of the way, and these places are just as untrustworthy as ""mainstream media."" There is a point to be made about the media controlling the narrative, but if you really want to know the truth you have to stop relying on these alternative media figures and be open to people challenging things that you have believed your whole life, especially if you are religious, in the case of my grandfather. 

There is also a case to be made about religion. If you were raised to place blind faith in supernatural stories that are hard to prove the happened in real life, there is a great chance you are prone to believing in conspiracies. However, religion is not the great evil itself, it is a tool, like money, those can use to influence others. 

I am worried about my family. Whenever they turn the TV on I can hear the hate that these people preach against the boogeyman ""Left"" and ""Antifa"". What will they think of me? How will they react if I bring a black friend home, or a Mexican friend, knowing that they are regularly racist to these people at home? They have become more bigoted, whether they know it consciously or unconsciously because of these QAnon adjacent theories. I just overhead my uncle talking about the deep state. I had more faith in him, hoping he was apolitical, but no. He is just like everybody else in my family: racist, classist, sexist, and judgmental towards people who live different lifestyles.

I first became aware that something was somewhat off as a child — when my mother was dragging her then five children to see 'healing revivals' attended by thousands, 'Christian' concerts, where people swayed in trancelike fixation, both hands towards heaven, speaking gibberish, or even at times — contorting on the ground like a fish out of water desperate for life.

It concerned me that people were not self-conscious, or even feeling a little absurd behaving that way in public, or worse, in private — seemingly for the satisfaction-or-amusements of other like-minded individuals — or the people who supposed to lead them.

Growing older, it got more ludicrous and more extreme — although now inside of these buildings, Pat Robertson, Billy Graham, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, and others. They were making wild claims, insisting that Jesus was returning imminently — and that we were in the 'end times.' They made tens of millions from exploiting the fears and devotion of these people.

Ridiculous numbers of people were going broke. Her three oldest (12, 14, and 15) would ask my father (who wouldn't attend) what would happen if our mother left us there. She constantly threatened to leave us with other 'Charismatic Christian' family counselors to drive the evil and lust for sin out of us.

I was forced into parochial schools. Not Catholic, or Jewish (which is what I am, we are), but evangelical, charismatic Christian institutions — who believed in corporal punishment, humiliation, and wild racism. They groomed the young males into Christian misogyny with a drumbeat of 'women stand behind their husbands, and support them, not beside them.' You would hear girls (prepubescent) talking about how they will be a Proverbs 31 woman. Those women are the modern ""Q"" movement; they were children during this movement.

Luckily, I escaped through academia. State testing and the not yet pervasive homeschooling movement were luckily at odds — the state discovered that not only should I, but I could rapidly accelerate my education, graduating from high school just shy of my 15th birthday.

My sisters didn't fare so well — because they were, after all, girls. In their way, each one escaped, educated, and became independently successful. They found husbands, and in some cases, left them. They found careers, and each has been thriving.

The above preamble illustrates that these people have existed (those susceptible to these kinds of cults and radicalizing religious groups) within the US, pervasively, since its inception.

In 2017, everything changed. I would describe a person I would define as a religious fanatic and disciplined Christian who became unhinged, cruel, hateful, overtly racist — dismissive, xenophobic, and believe it or not — a Holocaust denier. My bubbie (mum's mum) was a Holocaust survivor who lived to 102, the only survivor of 12 children from Birkenau concentration camp. My mother denied the genocide of our entire family (my maternal grandmother was the only survivor on that side of the family) by hateful, racist misinformation — propagated by 'Fake News' reinforced by irresponsible platforms like Facebook and Fox, and made ever-present by the society unraveling platform of Twitter.

In 11 months, my mother went from a harmlessly gullible grandmother and great-grandmother — to a raging racist, misogynistic crazy person, who believed in unhinged, untethered realities that assailed our ethnicity, our faith, and our sanity.

She began abusing my father, accusing him of being a pedophile, a sheep, brainwashed, and most importantly, ""The Deceived."" My father is in his late 70s, has dementia advancing, and cannot live unsupervised. She would withhold food, leave him in the bedroom for days, humiliated him in public, leave him at bus stops for hours why she ran errands — and came back to screaming insults and threats to abandon him at a VA home.

I removed my father from the house and placed him in assisted living just a short ride away from the grandchildren.

In 2018, my brother, then in his late 30s, was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer — and he deteriorated-and-died within 11 months.

During that time, we confronted many things — not the least of which is that my only brother was adopted in the 70s by our family, is mixed race, and came out as gay shortly after graduating college. Of course, when he came out, my mother told all sorts of stories to herself about how he may have those feelings, but never acted on them, and therefore, will most likely receive salvation — especially, if she can get him to admit that his lifestyle is disgusting, a choice and that he repents.

After about ten years, she gave up on those designs — and wouldn't speak of it, but was never cruel upsetting, or anything other than his mother. That is, until 2018.

Before I placed my brother in hospice, I brought the family together to explain my decision. We were all cornered-and-lectured by my mother, with a crazed look in her eye and an unhinged tone in her voice, that her youngest son was the victim of a pedophile ring (in the 70s) and that she rescued him, and that the brainwashing that he received between the ages of newborn and 3 1/2 years old have been 'triggered' by ""The Awakening"" because the 5G towers surrounding the large city in which they live — gave him cancer, and that dying gay, was G-d's retribution on his sinful life, if not for Democrats, Republicans would not permit his lifestyle. He would've both lived and known salvation.

Her five surviving children, 15 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren have not seen her since his funeral. COVID, of course, is a hoax. She refuses to wear a mask — and, therefore, cannot be around any of her children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.

Her ""Q"" friends warned her that the masks were a liberal plot to separate her generation from all previous generations so that the cabal — will not be challenged when the 144k children per year are ritualistically sacrificed, and then — I don't know, their blood is collected for some laughable word, that sounds as though Jim Henson wrote it into the plot of a Muppet movie.

The above is not an uneducated woman. She is not an isolated woman. This woman is not a poorly traveled, poorly read, or a poorly educated human being. This is an individual who speaks three languages, including English; got both a Bachelors and Masters of fine arts in performance on three instruments. An artist, writer, curious person with a quirky, often misguided allegiance towards religious dogma and devotion to a creator that she can neither see nor hear (audibly.)

I fear, if we dismiss, ignore, or ridicule these people more deeply — we'll turn a belief and cause into a religion, lifestyle, and dogma that will be unshakable. Our country is not without precedent. Even Ronald Reagan was taken in by a cultlike conspiratorial group early in his career. People cared enough about him — to sternly pull him away and make him realize that the fringes he was toying with would ultimately have him dismissed, debunked, and left off the playing field. Luckily, his ambition for power far exceeded his need for sycophantish praise from people on the margins of society.

I needed to share this — I'm not sure where it'll go, I don't know what to do, and I don't believe I will ever have a meaningful relationship with my mother again.

I suppose I'm either looking for support-and-permission to abandon the woman who gave me life so that I might save my own — or hope that there is a way to de-radicalize, deprogram, and get back the eccentric, quirky, brilliant woman — who was odd, but not insane.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,132186,public,confidence,self,I Guess it is Goodbye...,0,[],0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lkv861/i_guess_it_is_goodbye/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi,

We  are creative writers working on an electronic storytelling project  relevant to this sub. Our goal is not just to record the stories of  broken relationships but also to serve as a catalyst and platform for  mending those relationships.

Would  you like to try a gentle, non-confrontational way to reach your family  member or friend lost to Q? We are working on an electronic literature  piece to tell up to 20 stories about relationships that broke, due in  part to trusting in different information sources and thus developing  diverging political beliefs.

You  could invite your lost-to-Q loved one  to contribute, or you can  contribute your own story and send that to your loved one. This could be  a way to reach out and mend relationships.

Take our survey at  [https://infocue.surveysparrow.com/s/InfoCUE-Information-Creating-Understanding-and-Empathy/tt-c562ef](https://infocue.surveysparrow.com/s/InfoCUE-Information-Creating-Understanding-and-Empathy/tt-c562ef).  You can answer the questions yourself without your friend or family  member, or you can invite your friend or family member to answer them  jointly with you.  We will send your answers back to you in a form you  can share if you wish.

Reading a lot of these stories posted, that nasty feeling inside is enhanced because I notice striking similarities. The symptoms of someone falling down the Q-hole sometimes seem identical - the reactions, the hate, etc. 

She was my first friend when I moved in 6th grade (I’m 27 now, for reference). My parents were so happy I found a friend who 1) I liked 2) had been surrounded by “like” morals. 

Some background - we had just moved from a very religious, non-diverse (very white), low-income area. These points alone are not the issues, it was the parent’s and rhetoric of our neighbor’s that my parents were uncomfortable with. Friend’s parents would sneak bibles in my backpack, friends would make me cry in 2nd grade because my parents didn’t take us to church and I was going to hell, my parents worried about my sister and I at our friends’ for dinner because they knew we’d have to awkwardly pray. 

She was my first friend in my new town, her parents were pro-choice, separation of church and state, etc. What was great was finding people who didn’t allow their religious beliefs to blanket the country’s politics, even more so, people who had an aligned religious view. We felt like yay! We found our people. 

Even in my new town, our liberal views were not the norm, but we were surrounded by a different type of conservative view than in our previous hometown, or at least less “in your face”. 

My friend and I remained best friends throughout middle school, thru high school, and even tho different colleges we were close throughout those years as well. Post-grad we had our first official rift (2019 ish). It’s over things non-Q related so I won’t go into that - just different phases of our lives got in the way of being able to relate to each other. 

We keep afloat because by this time she is a new mom, and I want to be there for her and her new family. Just because I couldn’t relate didn’t mean I couldn’t be the cool aunt, help out from time to time, and just all around be there as a sense of normalcy outside of new parenthood etc. 

COVID hits and she’s hating on our state’s governor (who gets hated on by Trump and Trumper’s constantly). This was surprising to me, I truly didn’t expect her reaction to the governor’s shut down to be so short sighted? I expected some logical backboard in her frustration. 

BLM protests and presentations begin, maybe the first “major round” in summer 2020. A protest in a city across the state had minimal destruction done, she FREAKS out, calls them riots, is OUTRAGED at all the property damage....? But she called them riots. I challenged that, only to get immediate snark from her and another friend in our group chat. 

Then the suicide of that Isaac person happened, I had seen it on Twitter, not knowing at the time it had bases in Q conspiracy, I didn’t know what Q was at the time, I took note of the Twitter thread, thinking dang that’s wild &amp; probably untrue, but I might want to go back and read it later. 

Without having the chance to, she brings it up. I respond that I saw that, what was it? She sends me a 45 minute long video about Hillary Clinton trafficking kids from Haiti. Goes on about Monster’s Inc. being true only it’s The Elite taking screams from children to create adreochrome. I ask her, what about everything with Epstein and Trump, those rape accusations? She goes, I don’t know, I just know I Hate Hillary Clinton, and she’s an AWFUL human being who should burn in hell. Like so ANGRY. I was nervous texting about it, because everything I questioned she had a rebuttal for but it was often intimidating and aggressive. Like if I didn’t believe it... I’m completely out of my mind..?!

I asked her if she really thought this was true, it was sounding “pizza-gatey” and “but the emails”. She said, “that’s the thing - when I first saw pizzagate I thought it was bullshit, I believe it now”. She starts on other topics about how the BLM protests are being funded by democrats as a hoax. This was all really fucking sad. I haven’t brought up anything to her since, and neither has she. We’ve seen each other and talked just fine, but in the back of my mind I just do not like her anymore. I’m not sure if she is still believing everything, or where she stands with it. I don’t even want to touch the conversation with a ten foot pole. I would like to think after all the debunking she no longer invests in the conspiracy, but I don’t know. She doesn’t post, she just reads and absorbs. 

Her calling the BLM protests “riots” was enough for me to be super upset, but everything else on top of that it’s like, who is this person? 

Thanks for letting me vent, feel free to share your story in the comments.

Now she seems to be into some QAnon things, not believing all of it but it still concerns me. She's more open about her opinions and beliefs now, which is unfortunate. My dad isn't very into them, he watches them when she does at times, and i'm sure he isn't as extreme in his opinions.

She is a good mother in most aspects. She does a lot for me, is usually kind and caring. However, I just.. don't like her still ? I really try to, I think about how caring she is and how good she can be. I just can't get past the blatant racism, homophobia, transphobia and general disregard for others ( anti-vax, anti-masks etc. ). It hurts, because underneath it, I think she is kind and wouldn't hurt anyone. Yet clearly she can hurt people, so much. It hurts to know she can disregard science, our health and safety, as well as respect for others.

I got into an argument with her as she overheard me getting to a breaking point over these things. I was in pain that day regardless and I felt ill, and I just couldn't take it. I ranted to my brother about how I feel that's all she does all day - watch things that affirm these beliefs. She was really angry, calling me ungrateful and not letting me even apologise for what I said no matter how hard I tried to. She thinks she knows what I ""really"" think of her now. 

I don't think that badly of her, but I couldn't even express that It bothered me as I was shut down. Apparently I can't tell her what to believe or watch. Which is right of her to say, I can't do that. Yet it hurts to see my mother who i saw as kind and loving, turn into someone who could just easily say something racist, or praise a president who caused so much hurt and despair. I mean, she definetly hasn't been the nicest all the time, but I try not to think of that mistreatment, as I don't want to seem ungrateful.

The worst thing is i'm just full of guilt, I feel sick. I said some rude things I didn't mean. I have bad anxiety to begin with and I feel like i'm falling apart. She kept saying how she dislikes the way I act most of the times and the things I like, which also hurt a lot. She has always been enthusiastic about the things I enjoy previously.

I don't know if i'm a bad person for disliking her, or kind of losing it earlier. Due to her care she gives me I feel that I can't dislike her. I'm made to feel ungrateful if I critizise her for anything. 

I don't know if this guilt is common or not ? Please let me know if you have experienced something similar. I'm sorry for the long rant, i'm really not doing well with this.

There have been anti Semitic theories of deep state-style cabals for centuries. The fake document known as The Protocols of The Elders of Zion was like this, claiming that Jews were part of a cabal to control the government and the world.

But perhaps the most startling is the nearly word for word similarity to the Pizzagate insanity. For centuries, there has been anti Semitic conspiracies in some parts of the world that Jews kidnap non-Jewish children and eat them in order to perform rituals and stay young. Sometimes these theories mention molestation. Of course, most sane people can hear this and realize how anti Semitic and ridiculous it is, but the Pizzagate theory is almost word for word the same and all these people fall for it. Not to mention it just replaces the word “Jews” with synonyms like “Hollywood Elites” or “rich globalists like George Soros”.

So I have two friends who fell into the Q reality (Just ‘q-land” from now on). One is still in it; the other is back into reality, our real, shared normal reality.

BTW- for those interested, The Qanon/embrace of the tRump movement can be traced from 4chan, back through “something awful’ a website of the 2000’s then back to Japan’s economic crash of the 90’s. (ie QAnon-Anon podcast ep 128).  

First, we are not, or rather were not, in an age of unique increased conspiracy thinkers (as of 2014 anyway) While there have been spikes, the level of conspiracy theorists in the country usually returns to a baseline, or has since WWII. (See Suspicious MInds: Why We Believe Conspiracy Theories by Rob Brotherton. So why the spike of Q? It’s a perfect storm, so to speak:

-The growth of the internet and social media. Information sources have grown almost exponentially since the internet started. The world is more complex. This makes people afraid, less certain of their world. It is harder to be sure of things, hence harder to make sense of the world with so many competing sources od explanatrion, the ground is shaky so to speak. People seek comfort through explanations, and for some, the simpler the better.  

-The effect of “Chan” memes, etc:  4Chan, etc. members’ point of being is to ridicule popular culture by blowing it up from within, so to speak. Undermine it by popularizing things that undercut baselines and reality. Promoting tRump was one such act. 4Channers KNEW tRump’s horrible financial history, his faults, that he’d most likely be a horrible leader, but they promoted him because 1)it was a bad joke to play on everyone else (who had jobs, families, etc) and 2) he was, in a way, like them; willing to break norms. 

-Covid/time: A component of growth in q-land adherents has to do with so many people having had extra time on their hands to browse YouTube and other echo chambers via lockdowns, layoffs, closed restaurants, movies, etc. 

-Covid/financial: Most people who stormed the capital had some kind of recent financial setback/difficulty. This is, of course, not true of many q-landers, just some of the most extreme, but the base that grew it into a critical level needed for respectability, a tipping point that gave it some validity to where others were drawn into it, were by and large, under/unemployed 4channers and other “channers”.  People in these communities needed to spend vast amounts of time participating to be accepted hence they were people with no, or low paying, jobs, people with loads of extra time with no spouses or families or interests except 4chan, etc, who demanded their time.  Busy people with active jobs and interests and families were just non-existent on early 4-chan communities that started to promote tRump as a joke to foist upon everyone else.

-The grifters:  Facebook/YouTube/etc. ; Once it had grown large enough, the grifters moved in.  Youtube and Facebook, etc. allowed ‘influencers’ to monetize’ q-land with their videos and Facebook groups seeking donations. 

 -There is no one Q doctrine. It is flexible; people can apply whatever parts they want to their specific belief system, and its holes. So many voices, so many things to pick and choose from.

 -It starts with little things that have a grain of truth. I.e. Alex Jones claims scientists are making human/animal hybrids. If you look it up, you see he is technically correct in a very, very small way, but 1) they are not growing chimeras and 2) that is the kind of thing (gene splicing, etc.) that science DOES, they push boundaries. Yet some don’t make that distinction, and say “hey, Alex is kinda right, what else does he have to say?”  Or: Child trafficking goes from generic child sexual abuse to adrenochrome seeking  baby-killers in a public pizza parlor by national figures over the course of 20 videos watched.

-So, there is no typical Q-lander, although there are a few traits that seem to make people more susceptible (ie younger males who feel disenfranchised, no power), conservatives (who show higher fear response in brain scans when faced with unknown/uncertain change, hence high gun ownership, fear of immigrants), people previously attracted to other ‘isms’ (even liberal new-age-isms, ie people who might bite at the child trafficking part of q only to start believing the adrenochrome storyline), people who have a predilection for authoritarianism (more toward trump supporting parts of Qanon).  See Suspicious Minds, Brotherton, CH1 for a more specifics about people who may be predisposed to conspiracy theories.  A number of theories abound, I doubt there is one set of driving traits.

Mix those things in (and I’m sure I missed a bunch) with the following: confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance, and you have people who you CANNOT logically talk away from q-land.

Confirmation bias is when we are told/shown we are wrong but we double down, and start cherry-picking only information that confirms our ideas, and rejecting other data. This is where the rejection of ‘lame stream media’ and ‘you’ve been brainwashed’ and “sheeple” come in. The harder one pushes, the harder the believer digs in and reaffirms their own position.

It’s like a drug: as with most drugs the high/other feelings of validation/security/etc start to seem insufficient, so they spend more time on the internet, and start believing more &amp; more outlandish things to both give them the ‘conspiracy high’ and fight off the effects of cognitive dissonance.

 Cognitive Dissonance:  (Read “A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance”, by Leon Festinger. This is the original thesis for C.D.)  At some level, people KNOW that what they believe does not jive with reality, or at least they are presented with evidence of it.  The predictions fail, counter evidence is presented, etc., so people have to do SOMETHING with that internal conflict, deal with it somehow. Anger at family members, not only for challenging their belief system, but, eventually, for not joining in. Another example is when q predictions fail they often deal with the cognitive dissonance with “Well, it was worth it because we made great friends, we’re still a special group” (said one popular QAnon YouTube grifter to his adherents when the military takeover failed at the inauguration, and he decided to move on to other things, leaving his flock stranded) and they move on to other things to seek the same camaraderie.

Per my friend who was a q-lander, attempts to logically dispel their beliefs were useless. Absolutely pointless, in fact, they can be harmful as they drive the other person further away. They still chuckle when I ask why I couldn’t talk them out of it. “You don’t get it, NOTHING you could have said would change my mind, ESPECIALLY if I thought you were on the other side politically. Nothing.  He said it was not like telling a drug user that drugs were bad, it was more like telling a drug user that drugs don’t make you feel good. (The analogy is off, I know, except for the pointlessness &amp; futility it expresses). They came to the realization themselves. It is as simple as that.

There are organizations that deal with teenagers, fairly successfully.  However you cannot take an adult’s internet away against their will, make them attend counseling, and detox them from Qanon without their permission.

Finally, maybe, hopefully, for whatever reason(s); social isolation, job loss, loss of friends, family, the failure of one too many predictions, or the inability to overcome the ever growing cognitive dissonance and finally see things as they actually are, your friend/family member/spouse/etc might want to come back to reality. My friend experienced EXTREME feelings of shame, guilt, self-loathing and, most importantly, feelings that they didn’t think they would be accepted or welcomed back by family and friends. They were extremely surprised when the reaction was not hate and ridicule, but “welcome back, we missed you”.

I am so heartbroken for all of you out there suffering from broken marriages, broken parents, broken friendships because of the Q cult. I think like many observers, I thought Q fever might break after January 20–at least to some extent. 

Obviously it hasn’t.

So I want to stress something to all of you: it is very, very, very important that you vote for organizations or candidates who give no quarter to Q. Yes, I know implicitly this means I’m saying “Vote Democrat.” 

Let me say I’m not a registered Democrat and have supported both Democrats and Republicans. 

Right now, Republicans don’t know what to do with Q. At the state level, they are embracing it; at the federal level, some are enamored with it while others are disgusted. Conservative *political operators* are lining up behind it, however. You see Q implications all over content from conservative social media influencers, bloggers, podcasts, etc. Even Tim Tebow is now obsessed with saving children from human trafficking (a noble cause but largely ignorant that most victims of human trafficking are adult women, and often prosecuted for sex crimes. Sorry Tim, it’s Qbait).

Cults like these aren’t really just cults. They are chaos operations, meant to disrupt the dynamic of elections and divide us so bad actors can seize power in the vacuum. If principled Republicans form a third party, it is more likely conservative/moderate Democrats will be the voters drawn to it than Republicans, who typically vote party lines more rigidly and are rejecting facts at an astonishing rate. 

Families of those who suffered from Q craziness could make the difference here. Before all this, some (not all) of you voted with your parents, your husbands and wives, your siblings and friends. It’s not enough to break ties—we must prevent this group from taking any form of power or control over the actual levers of our government. 

If we do not, we all know they will create a self-fulfilling prophesy. They will round up everyone they are already convinced is guilty. They will engage in violence to “prevent violence.” They will gaslight us all into living in their reality. It’s so essential we all do our part to block this group or any that supports or implicitly accepts its thinking from power. 

We can see the writing on the wall. Republicans are probably not going to divide; Q will remain a faction to be dealt with.

A little bit of context: there are only three in my household: my parents and I (19yo Male).


The casualty is my Mother.


I have been Right-leaning my whole life. I'm a Christian and my parents have been cops: my Mom was the first Female Chief of the neighboring town, and my Father (just retired, bless him) was the Chief of my hometown for 40 years. So based on my upbringing, it isn't surprising to see why I was Right-leaning. I still have some Right-leaning beliefs, but that's not what is important. What is important is the stuff that has divided our nation.


My support for Trump had been eroding for a while, even preceding recent events.


The first point of contention with my Mom was the election. Based on simple math: (Number of registered voters in America × percentage of Democrats + percentage of Left Leaning Independents × voter turnout rate) gives you almost exactly how many votes Biden got.
However, my Mom was fully with Trump. That Trump won by a landslide and that there was actually MASSIVE fraud. Now, fraud is not impossible, but I do not believe there would have been enough to sway the result of the election.

So I had become disenchanted with Trump and really only kept a glimmer of faith in him because the Republican Party still supported our Law Enforcement.


Now for the next couple of months, the theories and stuff that my Mom was viewing was getting crazier and crazier. She eventually got hooked to this theory that there was going to be a huge reckoning on Inauguration Day.


I obviously took objection to this ludicrous theory. However, she slammed me with something that pissed me off so bad at could barely even finish my argument, which is uncharacteristic of me as people note I have good control over my emotions. She said ""You're becoming Liberal as fuck and it's scaring me!""
The fact she threw that at me, just because I was trying to get her back on track... I didn't know what to say and I still don't, and that was over a month ago.


Then the final glimmers of hope I had were crushed with the siege on the Capitol. Seeing a bunch of Trump supporters clashing with those Police Officers at the barricade. Calling those poor officers Traitors for doing their job. This was an enormous backstab, and days later I changed my Political Party Affiliation to Independent/None.


""But it was actually Antifa!"" She says. The sad part is that I don't know if she truly believes that or couldn't accept reality. She did condemn the attack itself on the Capitol, but I don't know who she thinks the perpetrators were.


Then comes Inauguration Day, and lo and behold, the Reckoning was bupkis. She called off work to see what was going to happen, and she would up crying all day while watching the TV. Now I don't know if the root of these tears is sheer panic and that ""America is going to end"" or if she realized that I was right and she was lied to.


She's been quieter about her beliefs since. Now nobody in my household is a big fan of Biden or Harris, but I can say with certainty that I am just not a fan of either side right now. The saddest thing of all is that I have to say ""sides"" as people forget that we are all AMERICANS and that we all live under the same stars and stripes.


I am not sure if she is still stuck in QAnon ideals or not. Only time will tell.

His dad , a former alcoholic who had been sobber for decades , got back to the bottle.  His mother just begun with Alzheimer's.

We sit down as a family to watch tv, she sees something about Disney, launches right into Gina Carano and cancel culture (anyone else notice these culture war headlines setting people off?). I pushed back gently, tried to say I don’t agree with firing everybody for what they post, but you need to judge case to case objectively, and Gina Carano posted some really vile stuff that fans reacted to. Well it didn’t really matter, she was off and running.

Cancel culture, the election was stolen, the Keystone pipeline, China, on and on. I argued back but tried to stay calm as she screamed at me. Began nodding and saying “yeah, sure, absolutely,” at the crazier stuff, which infuriates her.

I lost it when she got to transgenders taking over the country and how they’re going to go into the locker room and rape our daughter (17, sitting in the room, remaining remarkably, admirably calm). I jumped up and said “You are out of your mind!” She continued screaming at me about abortion and how she (my wife) and all the other conservatives are going to be put in jail. So I withdrew again, went back to sarcastically agreeing. She stormed off, went to bed, left the house early Saturday morning and texted me Saturday evening to say she was staying over at her mom’s. I said great, have a good time.

She came back midday yesterday, Sunday, and tried her best to act like everything was normal. I played along because I just don’t have the energy and I’m sticking to the gameplan. We went out to dinner (were supposed to go Saturday for Valentine’s/my birthday - yeah, she casually trashed my birthday). We had a pleasant enough dinner. She told me that the vaccine is causing tons of miscarriages. I said no, I have not heard that. Moved on.

Anyway... thoughts? All this triggered by a grievance relating to the firing of an actress whose name she didn’t know until that day.

He's spent 20 years in the air force and is now retired.  We live minutes outside of US Strattcom as he's an independent contractor and genuinely one of the smartest people I know when it comes to linux and windows systems.

He's also been a rampant conspiracy theorist for all of my life and, as much as I've tried for 11 years to get him to put his head out of them, I don't believe I ever will. It's worse because he's also gotten to my sisters and my extended family who, fortunately enough, take him at surface value. 

Something that I don't think I'll ever get rid of and made sure to keep is a bottle of Infowars Brain Force Plus pills he bought in 2017 because, after talking with him and picking his brain on the matter, he's been following most conspiracy theories since he retired in 2004. The first time that I had heard anything about ""The illuminati"" would've been around 2008 when I was playing a game and he pointed out the architecture that ""resembled a masonic temple."" 

I wish I had more to say but even after years of just talking to him about it, the reality of the situation is that he never really was a father to me until we were both adults and I tried my best to reasonably walk him out of the events that have been going on. I had saw that he had ""QAnon drops"" in his youtube search feed and instantly started looking into it back in October to prep for getting him out of it. I've been able to mostly but it doesn't change the fact that most of his views are heavily right leaning, going along with the ""Big Tech is censoring everybody who doesn't give into groupthink because the NWO is trying to cause a civil war in America to get rid of guns forever"" crowd, and I don't think that I'll ever be able to see him as anyone more than a man who fell to dillusions his entire time of knowing me.

I'm 21 and I can think for myself, so I'm pushing myself to get out of the country honestly and probably head out to Canada to be away from my family and to just be away from them all. It sucks because I'm giving up really good job opportunities but just being an independent adult and away from it all sounds like stepping out of a hell I've been in all my life.

I am a 55-year-old retired Air Force intelligence analyst, currently working as a civilian in the US Intel community. At age 49, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Four months later, my wife of 18 years left me, taking my daughter with her.   


I hit rock bottom that summer, but friends pulled me out of it, and I started the convoluted game of dating in your fifties. After a couple of years of striking out, I finally met the woman of my dreams. Smart. Strong-willed, but vulnerable. Honest and caring. Well-traveled, with lots of experience. And like me, a ""conservative democrat"" or a ""liberal Republican."" A year later, we were engaged, and I found happiness again.

About a year go, her father died, and due to COVID restrictions, she couldn't go to his funeral, and had no closure. That's when one of her brothers started feeding her QAnon information. Almost overnight she went from that moderate political stance to an extreme far-right stance. She referred to Trump as ""the hand of God"" or the ""second coming"" and, well, you're all familiar with the deep state, Bill-Gates and the vaccines, aliens, angels, JFK Jr is alive, plan-demic and other theories this group shoves down their throats. It started forming a wedge between us, as she often sees me as an enemy now, someone who shoots down everything she finds important. In the last two months, she has twice broken off our engagement, and last night accused me of being with her in an attempt to steal her house from her.   


I should probably just give up and walk away, but I can't. She's been with me through so much, even helping me following hip replacement surgery, allowing me to stay with her for ten days of healing. I love her with all my heart, and I know she's still in there somewhere, under all that hostility and anger. So I am hiring a renowned exit counselor who has pulled MANY people out of cults in the past. It's going to cost me an arm and a leg, but if I can get her back, it'll all be worth it.

I've been reading this sub for a while. These stories are heartbreaking, but the support in this community is amazing. I wanted to share my experience here, with people who will understand the preemptive grieving I've been going through for the past year.

2019 was the most comfortable I've ever felt with my parents. I've always felt like we just didn't really know how to love eachother. That culminated in 2005 when Fox News convinced my dad I was going to become a terrorist for visiting Turkey. He refused to talk to me for a few months, but eventually apologized and we worked to build back our family. And 2019 finally felt...easy. We enjoyed each others company. We could discuss opposing views and still find common ground. It was great, until March 2020 and the lockdown. 

Dad was consumed with anger. Immediately started spewing conspiracy theories.  Mom soon followed down the rabbit hole. All they did all day was listen to shows like Dan Bongino. Despite me having anxiety attacks, my husband and I still visited every weekend and saw them every holiday. They would start embarassing fights full of BS. We could not talk about anything without it leading to a ""THEY don't want you to be free"" rant. Mom couldn't even listen to classic rock without getting mad about its ""liberal agenda"".

IDK if they ever knew they were parroting Q specifically, but they beleive both that Covid is a Chinese bio-weapon and ""not as bad as the flu"". They believe the election was stolen and that Trump would eventually be inaugurated. Antifa is persecuting poor white supremacists blah blah blah. I don't think they beleive in lizard people, but they definitely buy into ""Dems are ALL EVIL and control the world, but Trump will save us"" rhetoric.

Things have gotten quieter since Jan 6th. Dad has not been hanging out with us when my husband and I visit, but I think it's because he doesn't want to start a fight/make us uncomfortable. They have also been getting outside more. They went sledding yesterday, by themselves, which I think is pretty awesome! I've been waiting for them to decide to cut ties, like last time. But I am hoping that this new avoidance of these topics is a sign they are trying to let go of their anger and move forward. Maybe I'm being too optimistic. I don't know where this is going and I'm exhausted. I'm preparing to lose them, while hoping I won't.

This forum has helped me so much by helping me to contextualize what previously I'd experienced in a horribly personal/isolated way--it had felt like, oh, god, i'm the only person in the world with parents like this, it must mean that insanity runs in my family, and that i'm a bad person for not being able to communicate, etc., etc. 

I think if we can really dig for the explanations here (beyond ""insanity"") we can seriously accelerate our own healing -- and, who knows, society's-at-large :)? 

So, here are a few of the most compelling explanations I've come across in this forum and elsewhere. 

1. Tribal identity -- maybe the most neutral explanation, just says that (some) people will go with their tribe/think with a tribal mind before all else. In my case, my parents were always in the tribe of White Republican Evangelical. The limits of the tribe (the qualities that defined it negatively) were hatred of liberalism, socialism, atheism, market regulation, elite expertise/rationalism/science---all synonymous in their mind with ""Democrats"". 
2. Media bubble -- related to the tribe. In the nineties, my parents were still reading some mainstream publications, but by the early aughts they'd followed the tribe into the rightwing media bubble, sealing themselves into a cultish alternative reality which has metastasized w/ Internet. 
3. Religious / Magical thinking -- Argues that American evangelicals have been primed all their lives to accept things on faith/feeling rather than science; also, they've been trained to equate certain elements of our contemporary society with christianity: namely, capitalism and the free market and businessmen (this is the reason my parents gave for ""believing"" in Trump. ""He's a businessman,"" they'd say -- to them it was equivalent to saying he was good, just, moral, and Christian). 
4. Cognitive dissonance caused by magical thinking -- Argues that it is frustrating/enraging to constantly be in a cognitive dissonance, in which what you are told to believe defies the evidence of your physical senses and experience of the actual world. Alan Watts argued this in the 1960s, raising an alarm about faith-based thinking &amp; society (you can listen to him, for instance, here: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/2SlRSExWYl6n2WbtnallXt?si=evtSmkdPSmKB5hWHh1Xdfw](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2SlRSExWYl6n2WbtnallXt?si=evtSmkdPSmKB5hWHh1Xdfw)). Rage and retreat into a bubble like Q/MAGA are typical responses. 
5. Losing the culture/morality war - The left has won the war over which culture gets to call itself ""moral,"" especially inside mainstream institutions. This drives the right insane, since conservatism has love of institutions and moral uprightness woven into its fiber. Liberals have successfully redefined morality as embracing multiculturalism, racial equality, gender equality, sexual freedom, and respect for the climate, among other things, and have pushed rightwing viewpoints out of the universities, etc. The right has yet to think up a viable response to this, and so has slid into pure opposition and conspiracy. 

I'll stop there -- I haven't mentioned economic explanations (my parents are rich, and i guess probably hate the specter of a future in which they/white people aren't the sole emperors of America), or the ""browning"" of America, or probably a ton of other things....

I work with someone who I am in no doubt is a Q follower. They have recently limited their social media profiles so the crap they post and share is no longer easy to view, although thanks to some internet sleuthing, I have managed to screenshot some of their posts. 

Their role sees them come into contact with the public on a regular basis. Whilst at work, they do adhere to Covid safety guidelines (masks, gloves etc) but in their spare time they post reams of anti vaccine shit, attend anti-lock down rallies and events and do not adhere to social distancing rules. To me, that makes any mask wearing in work null and void if they're mixing with all and sundry the rest of the time. 

Through some further investigation - they also appear to be liking and sharing content that is far right leaning as well as attending events protesting against sexuality education in schools etc. Basically it's a pretty toxic mix of 'Q' supporting, Covid-denial and anti-Semitism.  

I basically want to report them - but don't know A) if I have enough proof and B) if said proof is enough to remove them from their role?

I listened to both my son and sister, trying to under what they were talking about and doing my own research into the wild claims. My deduction, this was absurd but I wasn’t sure how much they truly believed.
Fast forward a year ago. A friend texted me and stated that my son was posting his conspiracies on FB ( I don’t use FB). I dismissed it as just his way of trolling the “libs” as he called them. My sister and I had quit speaking as I was furious about some of the stuff she was spouting off about and I hung up on her. I missed and loved her, but she was not the sister that I once knew.
Six months ago, the civil discussions and debates with my son began to get more heated. I tried reason, empathy, finding common ground in the fallacy of his beliefs but to no avail. One morning over coffee I lost it, full out screaming, crying, threatening that I would not listen to it any longer. It was intense and I was ashamed that I had lost it.
My sister was killed on her motorcycle at the beginning of the pandemic (careless motorist). Fortunately I had made peace with her a month before and our conversation had no talk of politics. I am thankful for the last conversation that we had.
My son and I settled it and he no longer brings up any Q conspiracies. A few weeks ago he “wiped” his FB and social media accounts of all of the Q bullshit. Wether he still believes it or not, I do not know, but many of his friends explained to him that it was not beneficial to his reputation or integrity. 
All I can say is that I was so incredibly naive; January 6 proved that we have to be vigilant about protecting and preserving critical thinking in all. In hindsight, I am thankful that I did not really understand how far down the rabbit hole both my sister and son had gone or I would have been frozen in fear and emotion.

I grew up in a very diverse household and live in Los Angeles. My sister grew up in upper middle class neighborhoods so has not been exposed to very much outside of typical suburban life. My sister was never a trump supporter or conservative  however shortly after trump was elected she started dating a guy who worked for spacex. They immediately moved in with each other and he decided to move to other spacex locations and my sister went along with him. Shortly after, my sister had a baby with him and they moved to Florida. My sister did not like his trump obsession or his sisters Trump obsession and it made her uncomfortable but she lived with it. Right before covid hit he moved my sister and the kids with him to Florida. This bothered me however they were coming to visit soon so I made plans to spend time with her as much as I could. When the time came, my sister was not able to spend time alone with me or come to my house. We were able to get him to agree to allow us to go to the mall because he was hungover and wanted to take a nap. This was the last time I saw my sister. 

Not long after, he became more obsessed with conspiracy theories and right wing extremism. It wasn’t long before my sister was sending me pictures of them hanging out at a house with confederate flags. Shortly after that they had a stockpile of guns and were spending all night drinking. My sister started to fall down the hole with him and I couldn’t even have a conversation with my sister without him in the conversation. She’s not allowed to visit or even have a job or go to school and she is trapped in the house all the time alone. He would send me link after link after link to bs qanon garbage to try to radicalize me but I am much less impressionable. 

One day my sister face timed me while my boyfriend was over. My boyfriend is from Armenia and has a very heavy accent. They immediately started ridiculing him and asking him why he still speaks English so poorly when he’s been here since the 90s. Ironically, my boyfriend speaks better English than both of them put together and has a college degree unlike either of them, he just has an accent. He started joking back to them but wasn’t disrespectful which then led to her boyfriend threatening him the next day to me. This hurt me deeply.

My sister joined a left wing group I was in and everything was fine until her boyfriend then joined (he has to be a part of whatever she’s doing) and the same day she was posting racist and xenophobic things about Chinese people which obviously got her immediately banned and me embarrassed.

About a week later the George Floyd incident happened and she was heartbroken by the video. She felt what happened to George Floyd was terrible and that night her and her boyfriend got in a big fight about it. Two days later she was calling me repulsive for protesting and “supporting animals”. She sent me a picture of someone burning a flag and I immediately knew this was all him. My sister could give two shits about a flag. 

I was heartbroken but knew I had to cut them off. I blocked my sister in May and haven’t talked to her since. In this time she has been completely radicalized in Q conspiracies and their relationship and lifestyle has become so unhealthy that social services is now involved. I make decent income and can afford to buy a bigger place to get her and the kids away from him but I am scared that she’s gone too far off the deep end.

I also have a sister who is completely immersed in the world of QAnon. If my sister was the only person believing the things she claims to believe in right now, her delusions would mean she would almost certainly be diagnosed as psychotic and possibly schizophrenic. Yet, because many people share these same paranoid delusions and the delusions are literally propagated in memes and youtube videos (i.e., they do not originate spontaneously in my sister's head - as do most delusions in psychosis) then she is more aptly labeled confused, misled, brainwashed, gaslit, etc. And yet...it feels so similar to me. I know how to (well I think I have learned at least somewhat how to ) help someone with psychosis enter recovery. I know telling them their delusions are not real and that they need help does NOT work. I know medication often does work. And there is a fine balance of how to engage someone who is actively psychotic into seeking treatment before they bolt. Often they end up being forced initially. But the medication can really make marked improvements. 

I dont know how to help my sister. I know telling her that the delusions are not real wont work and hasnt worked. She totally shuts down and blocks my phone. But I also dont think medication will help. I feel it is probably more like trying to rescue someone from a cult. Which I have no experience with.

My story is long, but I'll try to keep it short. I have extended family that have always been extremely religious, and conservative. They've been into Q from the very beginning (5g, pedophile rings, bill gates, covid hoax, vaccine chip, etc.) 

In the fall a family member who believes covid is a hoax, gave my grandmother covid. My mother is her primary caretaker, so this family member exposed both my grandma and my mother to the virus. It was a long road to recovery, but thankfully both are recovered. 

Throughout the last few years when they'd talk about these conspiracies, to me it was absolutely crazy, but in the end sort of harmless. If those are the things you want to believe, then whatever. But when they endangered my mother and grandmother with covid, that completely flipped a switch for me. I told my parents that I'm done with that side of the family entirely. 

My immediate family members wanted to still try to work things out, and had given them forgiveness. They set up parameters, and said that the relationship is at risk if you go beyond them. Its been nothing but a disaster since then. Every conversation has some political jab, and they won't stop mentioning the conspiracies.

The last straw was a couple weeks ago. The family member that transmitted covid to my grandmother, was trying to talk her out of getting the vaccine. Stated that the vaccine is dangerous and it's killing people. After that, the s*** really hit the fan. There's a very likely chance that we will not be speaking or seeing those family members again, until they get out of Q.

I'm just at an absolute lose that these family members are choosing Q over family. For me, the relationship has been over since the fall, but feel horrible for my immediate family members that tried to work things out. I have a few questions below, that I'd like some input on:

Have any of you put up parameters, and your Q person actually respected thoss request? 

When questioned on these conspiracies, they use biblical verses and religion as their main defense. How do you fight against this?

My name is Kim and I run a number of platforms on anti-racism, corruption, and inequality in America. 
I have a very educated father who has gone off the deep end with Trump conspiracy theories. So I very much can relate to the immense pain I’m reading about on this site. 
I believe this whole Qanon deception is yet another symptom of our nations choice to elect officials who do not have personal integrity. What’s happening in our Dem. Republic is complicated but not unprecedented, sadly.
The reason I am posting is I wanted to ask if there was anyone on this site who would benefit personally from doing a video interview about either their experience with Qanon or how a close family member’s experience has impacted them. I’m paid by no one and my allegiance is to the truth ... your story and your truth.
 I’ve done a number of interviews with people who have become members of organizations who have aberrant ideologies or are outside of social norms but have made it out. Integrity and the well-being of the people I interview are my absolute first priority. I will NEVER POST without verbal recorded or written consent after you approve the final video. This is about your story. Also I do not interview people for any reason other than that they would glean something from doing it. I am not here to hurt anyone... but to help explain so people can understand the human side of all this. 
I’ve interviewed the reformed leader of the Mississippi Aryan Brotherhood. I’ve interviewed  an overt racist from Tennessee who now helps educate white folks, and many others.  
I do live shows and post videos on many topics that help people understand inequality, corruption, racism, and bigotry in America today. I work from a historical and scientific viewpoint. 
I want to understand snd I want my viewers to understand the power Qanon seems to have over people. I want to understand the human side of how this sort of thing happens. 
 Please get a hold of me if you think you would benefit from telling your story. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have. If at any time during the process you change your mind about doing a video, I will delete it all with no questions asked. I do not create videos at the emotional expense of my fellow humans. Some people benefit from sharing their story because it can really go a long way to help others. For others who are private, there no way they’d ever be comfortable doing this.

I found out about his beliefs when quarantine started, and he started questioning if COVID was overhyped. We got into MASSIVE fights about it for a couple of weeks and finally, he ended things with me.

I recently talked to him again, and he is even deeper in conspiracies. 

I guess I just don’t have anyone to talk to about this. None of my family or friends believe any conspiracies, and the second they heard he believed in them they all told me to drop him immediately.

Here's the original text:

. . .

""Adults addicted to their own stress hormones were once children who lived in unpredictable environments of overreaction, rage spirals, and fear."" Dr. Nicole LePera (@theholisticpsychologist) 

She further writes:  
""My childhood environment was stable— meaning my parents were home + all of my physical needs were met. Dinner was at the same time. There was routine.  
But, it was also unpredictable. My dad, overwhelmed with pressure would erupt into yelling fits. My mom would completely shut down into silent treatments that would last for weeks. Because they could not regulate their own emotions, I developed severe anxiety as a child. One of my own childhood memories is around age 7 thinking someone would break in. Or cyclical thoughts that I’d wake up + someone would have died. A manifestation of the stress held in my body— + a nervous system that couldn’t cope.

This steady stream of hormones (adrenaline + cortisol) has all of us in an emotional cycle of highs + lows. Or chaos then lifeless exhaustion of irritability. Unconsciously— I would seek this in my adult romantic relationships. I’d push or knit pick.

When nothing was ‘happening’ I was bored.

I became accustomed to connection + love through my own bodies stress response. It’s how I felt like ‘me.’ It’s how I felt connected to others.

Emotional states create hormonal responses that when experienced long term— imprint both mind + body.

If we learned these states as children, we become adults living in a cycle of our bodies seeking these hormonal responses. All of this is unconscious.

Many adrenaline junkies are seeking that familiar pattern. So are many of us who engage in ‘on + off’ relationship dynamics.

Or spend hours of days consuming content that leaves us feeling angry, helpless, + resentful. Just as we did as children.

Healing is becoming conscious to when we unconsciously seek chaos + stressful states— why we do it + how often. With this awareness, we can begin to choose moments of peace + teach our bodies safety in the present moment.

There’s no shame in being caught in these cycles that the body has learned. The addictive nature is very real + so is the withdrawal."" \~Dr. Nicole LePera, The Holistic Psychologist

Five years ago my mother scoffed and shook her head in shame at the thought of someone showing support for Donald Trump and his hateful rhetoric. By the end of that year, both women ended up voting for him and never looked back. Now in 2021, both women have shared terabytes of misinformation on social media, egged on by my brother’s girlfriend and my dad’s sister both of whom are ardent Trump supporters and anti-vaxx. 

They aren’t at the point where they believe that Trump will save the world, but they’re close.

She constantly looks for some way to bring up the “double standard” that black people have in that they can get away with rioting and it be called patriotic, which has never happened. She called the rioters at the capitol protestors and refused to blame Trump for their actions.

Luckily I’m 21 and do not require my mother’s permission to get vaccinated. My sister has blocked me on almost all social media, I can’t see pictures or funny videos of my baby niece without asking my girlfriend to show me, all because she says I’m so “close minded”.

This is not a post I want to write or enjoy writing, but here we are.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I think buying into this stuff happens slowly over the years. I don't know if anyone else feels this way also (please comment if you do) but I think this can be traced back over a decade ago to when Qanon was not even a thing. My grandparents had recently retired and subsequently were faced with more free time. My family has always been more conservative than liberal, and originally we were not super ultra-conservative people, but generally believed in stuff like personal responsibility, tradition, rule of law, less taxes in general, regulation might not always be a good thing, etc. So when my grandparents retied they began spending more and more time watching Fox News, where they would listen to this stuff for a good portion of the day. I remember my grandmother driving my siblings and I somewhere when I was 13 and she had some radio talk show person on, who eventually started commenting about the Obama administration. My grandmother then told us about how Obama was really a Muslim, and was not born here, and is not a real American. When you are that young I don't think you really grasp the significance of saying something like that, but looking back its a telltale sign. Those embers of conspiracy theories have always kind of been there in my family, slowly simmering under the surface and eventually gave way to Q.

Over the years my grandparents would tell these things to their kids and in-laws who would listen, did not necessarily mean that they believed everything but they listened. It's become more and more apparent over the years. Another time I stopped by my grandparents house about 2 years ago and in the 2 hours I was there,  probably 75% of the time was them talking about how the left and Democrats are trying to destroy America, when I just stopped in to surprise them since I was in the area. That was the last time I ever did that. Now after 4 years of these things being injected into the mainstream, they were primed and ready for something like Qanon. My grandparents bought in lock stock and barrel and took other family members down with them over the quarantine when they had nothing but time and spent it on the internet where it was being circulated. They fully believe these things. Now after the election and pandemic with baseless fraud claims and theories about the virus being fake out there, they bought into those also. My family is full of hard-working, good, kind, thoughtful and loving people. I have never felt anything other than support and love from them. But now I am almost viewed as a traitor for not buying into Q like they did.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way or has realized this; but I think stuff like fox news or conservative talk radio have really acted as stepping stones for Qanon. I think people who buy into one thing end up falling down a rabbit hole that leads to Qanon and all the attendant lunacy that it comes with. I don't know what to do, anytime I try to reason with them they say I am brainwashed and indoctrinated by the liberal media. I feel like there is no reasoning with them anymore. To quote a political strategist, ""Sometimes you can't get to a yes with a person who is so utterly implacable, they won't say anything other than no."" 

I also want to add something I think is important to my story. I have been a conservative person and identified as a republican all my life. A lot of the things I have believed in like a strong military, fiscal and personable responsibility, free trade, and originalism to name a few, I still believe in. But now I feel like I am in the minority on my side of the spectrum. Being a conservative today means you worship Donald Trump, think he is the rightful commander-in-chief after a fraudulent election, and believe in whatever conspiracy theories he endorses. So it's just frustrating to me when I am called a defector and betrayer of the faith for not endorsing lunacy. I am essentially a conservative in exile: too old-school republican for the left and not crazy enough for the right.

Qanon has debased any political ideology in my family. I feel like they are part of a cult. I don't know what to do to address this anymore. Any time I push back I am mocked and discounted, and whenever I stay silent it is taken as complicity and validates these claims in their minds. I feel like I can't win no matter what I do.

His family on the other hand embraced Trumpism wholeheartedly, and then when they perceived even regular right-wing media outlets as being ""too liberal"" (aka too critical of Trump), they turned to some really darks parts of the internet for information, which as you can guess, led them to QAnon.

I remember when I first told my husband about QAnon last summer, he laughed and thought it was some hyper fringe thing and the media was probably blowing its prevalence out of proportion. Now that so much of his family has embraced it, he's a little horrified, but he thinks he can use reason and logic to get them back into a shared plane of reality. 

This has caused a lot of strain in my marriage. I don't want to spend time around his family any more. They literally can't even talk about puppies and the weather without turning it into some Q shit. They openly call me a communist who hates American and supports pedophiles. I've never heard my husband try to seriously defend me from these accusations and whenever I bring up how insulting their words are, he shrugs it off saying, ""they're just passionate about what they believe and said something they didn't really mean"" and ""you're just being too sensitive.""

Yet whenever I call his family crazy or point out that they're peddling lies that are destroying the fabric of our society, he immediately tells me to stop bashing them. The other night he literally said ""I need to stop picking on his family just because they have differing views."" He tells me I just need to take a break from the news and stop being so triggered by his family. 

The truth is, I don't ever bring up his family: *he* does. I would prefer not to have any talk of Q in my house, but he talks to them every day and patiently listens as they rant about Q stuff. He still tries to refute it, but it usually it just ends up with a lot of equivocating about how *yes*, he thinks Joe Biden is really creepy and okay maybe *sometimes* conspiracies have been true and sure, maybe there was *some* election fraud but probably not enough to affect the outcome of the election.

I now feel like I'm in a battle with his family over my husband's grasp on reality. I'm starting to feel like they're gaining ground. There's absolutely no way he's going to stop talking to them. He says all the time that he will never put politics over family, but lately it feels like he's putting his family over our marriage, and because all his family cares about is Trump and QAnon, he is in effect putting their politics over they family we've made together. I'm not his blood but we've been married for 8 years. *I'm* his family too.

We met doing advanced scuba training so we could teach scuba for a non-profit charity that gets disabled vets scuba certified and runs group trips. We thought that it would help show that if we (I am an amputee and he has limited use of his shoulder and arm) could do it, anyone can. 

  
We never had a political conversation....until trump got elected. 

  
Over the past year or so he has totally changed. He has become embittered, drinks heavily, and began having thoughts of harming others and himself in some grand gesture.

The last 3 times he called me, he immediately launched into a tirade about how only Fox news tells the truth and literally every other source on the planet is lying. It is this oddly specific fascination with fox news and trump as a savior that can do no wrong. It's just weird how he obsesses over specifically fox news and seems to get 100% of his 'information' from that source without ever questioning it. 

At first I tried to just debunk his nonsense- so our phone conversations became me having to Google facts to 'prove' his claims false. He would throw out some ridiculous claim, or just deny my points were valid until I was forced to provide a bibliography for everything I said. You can image how unfun that is. We stopped talking about scuba diving ages ago. 

After this went on, I have to admit I stopped being so polite and these conversations became arguments. I let my frustration come thru, exasperated with not only this crazy obsession with fox news, but his increasingly radicalized and hateful beliefs about anyone that dared question this new reality. He didn't have an opinion of his own, he was simply regurgitating whatever fox news told him. 

The final call came where he began the conversation bragging to me about how much he was drinking lately. Like he was proud of this. Then launched into his fox news obsession once again. My mistake was engaging again, and it ended up in a shouting match. I had mentioned a statistic, he challenged it so again I was forced to provide a source (in this case the US census) to prove my claim. I was right, he was clearly wrong. He accepted that but then jumped to dismissing statistics as a whole. It was insane on it's face- anything that damages their crazy world view is either a lie, or suddenly irrelevant. But in the next sentence tried to use statistics he pulled out of nowhere (well, pulled from fox news) just moments after telling me statistics are all lies. I lost my cool at that point, and I feel bad about it.   
He then confided in me that he was thinking that the VA was doing him wrong, and if they didn't see things his way, he would go to DC and harm others and himself in some violent gesture. He was vague on exactly what he would do, but it was incredibly alarming. I chalk it up to alcohol fueled bravery that he wouldn't act on. It's hard to tell when someone that is halfway thru a bottle is serious or not. 

At some point he hung up on me (by now we were in a full on shouting match) and texted me that we were no longer friends. That it was my attitude that wasn't up to his standards. Nevermind that it was him calling me, drunk, and spouting violence and self harm. Nevermind that the entire call was to get me indoctrinated into believing fox news, and only fox news. To my sober mind, it was nothing short of batshit insane. It just didn't make sense, and this wasn't the friend that I had known for several years. I know his family, I was the first friend he had at his new house. But now he is angry, fearful, lost in a sea of propaganda he can't tell from reality. Anyone that doesn't agree with him needs conversion...I can only imagine the environment at home for his wife and kids. 

That's my story about this nonsense. A good friend where I have very few, lost to toxic propaganda and hateful rhetoric. A quiet racism where ethnicity is a scapegoat. A world where the guy caught red handed trying to steal an election is somehow innocent and had the election stolen from him. I never heard of QAnon before- but I consider it all part and parcel of trumpism. I am not sure he even knows what QAnon is, but is a member of the cult nonetheless.

Source: **freejoy.aimoo.com**

The problem of United States Of America is lack of a real godlike leader.  
They   are losing on trade because they are too stupid, despite the fact they   are holding the most powerful tool of the game, which is technology.

If   Donald Trump the best CEO in USA who have the most real life  experience  cannot fix help America, then there is no any other CEO of  any  cooperation or any other American people can help. Because running a   business to take money from the sleepy public people is not as the  same  as take money from the same “level” opponent which are other  leader  groups from other nations.  
You can only deceive the stupid public people, but you cannot deceive the smart people.

The last hope for the USA is me the real savior Messiah Buddha.  
This article is the last signal I can give you for free of charge.

I have provided few ideologies about the future system. But in particular the USA situation, the solution should be like this:  
**Step 1:**  Setup  new political party which ideology of “everybody is equal,  everybody  can become president”. No left, no right, no central, only  “good,  suitable”policies, all people from all background are welcome.

**Step 2:**  Educate  the public people about the political system and what is  corruption,  and explain to them the only way to reduce corruption which  is give back  power to local government and the people.

**Step 3:**  Win the  election and allow new states to be established. In the new  states,  minimum wage will start from $0, and not under the federal  government  rule. Some example new states such as “only undocumented  migrants” or  “only black/white/yellow skin people”.

With this strategy, even in the current global financial system rule the problem around trade will be solved.

By   having new political party with “leaderless”, you are waking“God”  power  within everybody. The only different between the“politicians” and  you  are just they are corrupted and you are not.

If you cannot have a new political party to education people, you cannot win this game.

Starting   from 0 point seems hard but with 4 years, you can easily win the   upcoming 2024 election. Because you are using the better “God” ideology   of life than the fake voting democracy.

I  have a lot of other  strategies and methods to win this easy game, but I  cannot giving out  for free because there are many other nations as  well.

Make fair  amount of  donation, then I will giving out more details and other  Godlike  strategies which no any entities can counter it for they are the  Divine  way of life.

I'm sorry to say that the shared psychosis that is q anon has finally made its way to my family. My aunt, mother, and father were all Trump supporters who listened to right-wing talk radio, but never really got into conspiracy theories, until the Capitol riot kicked off all the talk about martial law and such. Now they have been gradually digging into q anon at a very alarming rate. 

I used to be a conspiracy theorist between the years of 2010-2015, so I have an idea of the pathological effects q anon can have on one's mind. It took me years to heal myself from the self-inflicted psychological wounds that came with the conspiracy theory mindset. Before, I used to be the ""nut-job"" of the family, thinking everything was a false-flag event, and now, my Christian family has latched on to q anon's propaganda like its the Gospel, and they seem to be degenerating faster than I was. It's like I just got away from my old mind-set, and now its all around me, haunting me. It's really a bizarre experience. 

I don't really know how to help my family members, but I can't just let them go crazy without saying something. I tried listening to them. That's what I wanted when I was into the NWO theories. I even asked them questions within the parameters of what they present me to try and gently point out the absurd contradictions in their *Theory of Everything*. 

Their logic is not penetrable. You can't fact check the overwhelming amount of lies and half-truths q anon puts out, and when you do, they twist the context to fit it into their theory. 

My family and I are all Christians, so I've found that the only thing that will silence them is to show how q anon runs against the teachings of Jesus Christ--**who told us to keep the peace to the best of our ability, love our neighbor as ourselves, and not to resist our enemies (but treat them with love).** I've managed to successfully diffuse two arguments with that approach, but it doesn't look like they've really budged in their q anon beliefs. Hopefully, if I keep trying, they will have to face their internal beliefs surrounding Christ. 

Maybe this technique will backfire. Who knows? Maybe they'll resent me even more for pointing out how q anon is contrary to their core identity. I don't know. What I do know is that things went from 0 to 80% crazy for my family in less than a week. I doubt this is an isolated phenomenon. 

Do you guys have any tips or experiences to share?

I just need to vent. 

I am at such a loss. I’ve always been super close and protective of my mom, especially since my dad passed 15 years ago. But ever since the august 2020 she’s gone into the Q-hole. 

It’s shocking because politics have never been an issue. She voted Obama twice and tends to side middle of the road on most issues. But now it’s trump trump trump. Obama was awful from day 1 blah blah blah. 

We’ve never really been a huge political family and have respected each persons views. But now that’s just gone. I’m “not seeing the world with open eyes.” I’ve begged her to stop getting news from her friends off Facebook. But it’s just getting worse and worse. I can’t even have a conversation without it getting political. I’ve given ultimatums. Which I regret. But it doesn’t matter. 

I guess I’m just sad because I’m losing my mom. I don’t recognize this person she’s becoming. Someone who I trusted and would seek advice from is now angry, anxious, scary, and just everything that goes along with Q. And I’m at a loss. My siblings can “deal” with it but I’m very outspoken and will voice my concerns. But this is really destroying our relationship. And it’s incredibly sad.

He often brings Q items up in conversation. He’s never mentioned Q and I’ve never brought it up to him. When he isn’t talking about Q, I feel that he is a very good person at heart. 

I’ve noticed his obsession with protecting the constitution but clearly having no understanding of how it works. He believes the election was stolen and everyone (courts, states, congresspeople etc.) is corrupt and that the military can seize power to protect the constitution. 

Of course, I explain to him that constitutionally speaking Biden is our president. All the required constitutional activities happened to determine our next president. People voted, states certified, congress counted, and Biden swore his oath and became president. The military itself would be breaking its oath by seizing power and installing a leader. 

He believes Mike Lindell over the courts. I don’t think he has ever read the court cases and thinks they provided overwhelming evidence. Read a bit on the cases and you will see the Trumps campaign offered little evidence and often picked fights over inconsequential numbers of votes. 

Has anyone else run into this odd misinterpretation of the constitution? The worry about individual freedom (something that is important to me as well) but also supporting a military takeover is so hard for me to even talk about.

My father was a former Alex Jones listener back in 2008 until about 2014, my father absolutely hated Barack Obama, but now can admit he was okay; however my Dad said he listened to it for mostly ""satire"" as the stories were insanely outlandish (the one we joke about is the FEMA deathcamps). My Dad as a lifelong Republican unsurprisingly voted for Donald Trump and ate up the loud mouth bigotry Trump spewed. My Mother an independent even did the same. My Dad supported Trump until about 2019, I can't exactly say when the tide turned for sure, but with the pandemic my Dad suddenly became terrified. He actually started wearing a mask back in February, and myself as a healthcare worker, he would lose his mind when I showed up after a shift in February. Suddenly, it was like the veil was lifted, he realized Trump was completely incompetent as soon after I lost my job, classes went online, I started sheltering in place, etc. My father suddenly realized, nobody had a plan and a lot of people were going to die. 

During this time, he was also laid off and had a death in the family so he retired, this is key here because it gave him all the time in the world ""to do research"". His sleep schedule was soon thrown completely off and he would sleep all day and stay up all night, rinse and repeat. So while he still hated Trump and acknowledged COVID was a dangerous threat and that mask wearing was incredibly crucial to stopping the spread; he'd also say crazy shit like ""you know this was made in a lab right?"" followed by him linking me to a super discredited ""research"" paper by a discredited Chinese scientist who claimed the virus escaped a lab in Wuhan. I pointed out the logical and bias flaws in the paper, including looking up multiple ""companies"" and ""contractors"" mentioned who all were not real individuals. He seemed to acknowledge it with a ""thank God you know how to really rip these things apart, guess you're learning something in college!""

So life was good until about the end of May when the George Floyd protests started, suddenly his old racism was back, calling the protestors thugs and looters who ""need to stop mooching off me and get back to work."" This was a tense period of time for us as I attend school for public health and my interest is in the social determinants of health, so I literally research the inequities these communities of color face and their impacts on their health. Eventually, my father surprisingly caved, and admitted that a lot of cops are out of line and ridiculous. Life again was good, the election came and went and my parents were elated that Biden won, myself more relieved (?) that things would slowly return to the capitalist nightmare we lived in before Trump. 

With December coming, I slowly was promoted in my healthcare role and qualified for the first round of COVID vaccines (Pfizer) at my job, I excitedly signed up for the vaccine and told everyone I knew I was getting it so they could come to my about my personal experience, I hoped this would alleviate some of the fear mongering going around; especially in my rural hometown. I got the vaccine and visited my parents that weekend, my father was suddenly angry and outraged that I had gone through with getting the vaccine, telling me ""Why would you get that fucking poison injected into you? Willingly?"" To which I replied, I had done plenty of reading into studies about mRNA vaccines, their safety, how they are created, and read the individual data on the Pfizer and Moderna reports to which I concluded that the risk vs benefit ratio was significantly in my favor for benefit. My father gave me the classic ""Oh you think you know everything going to college hmm? Smart man all of a sudden?"" I was outraged and insanely upset, telling my mother that I would happily schedule an appointment for her, but my father was on his own since all of a sudden, he was a vaccine expert. My mother later texted me saying my father was sorry and that he wanted me to look for an appointment for him. 

Queue to this week, my father was set to go out of town to visit a friend down south at the beach, all of a sudden the friend cancelled because a contact of his got COVID from a friend coming out of town, my father's friend decided the risk wasn't worth it and cancelled. My father sick of being at home was devastated, coming up with all kinds of crazy nonsensical reasons why his friend cancelled i.e. he must hate me, he's tired of me visiting, etc. So a few days ago, I call my father absolutely shaking, I got him a COVID vaccine appointment, it was a bit of a ways away, about an hour drive, but he was set to go. Suddenly he texts me saying ""I don't trust it."" So I kind of give him some time to process it, figuring he woke up grumpy as it was 8am and he was a night owl. I text him a ""I don't really know how to respond, so I'll give you some time to think things over, talk soon bye."" Queue to tonight, he texts me asking about his appointment and if it's cancelled. I tell him that his appointment is still on since it's 2 weeks away so I figured I'd give him a little over a week to consider it. 

And now to the point of this long winded post, he links me to [Children's Health Defense - the Defender](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/) , so I do a few quick searches and find that it is known for its anti-vaccine activism. I also pick an article at random and point out all the issues with it such as the Bell's Palsy cases are the same percentage as those in the population who randomly acquire Bell's Palsy, meaning it's unrelated to the vaccine. I also say out of 10 million plus doses of the vaccine, 600 ""reported deaths"" is incredibly low and mention that most of them once again, match the number of random cardiac deaths in the population. All my father says is ""I'm glad I read this before it's too late, these people are actual doctors, how am I not supposed to believe them!"" and then went on to ridicule my academic career (you're just a semester away from a MPH, these people have MDs!!). I'm not really sure what to do as I broke my whole family out of this crazy Trumplican cycle this past Spring (my mother was the easiest, followed by my younger brother, and then my Dad). I felt like I was making such incredible progress within my family and my ""radical liberal politics"" such as free healthcare and free education were becoming normal dinner talking points with good conversation. Now all of a sudden, vaccines are bullshit, I'm better off if everyone else gets it, etc. I also reminded him that he regularly smokes good ole cowboy killers AKA marlboro reds and that he never gave a shit about what was in them and what they did to his body, but suddenly he's concerned about ""long term effects from a vaccine, it's too new, I don't want that mRNA shit, I'll wait for the J&amp;J shot."" So I guess in the end it's not awful as he said he'll gladly get the J&amp;J shot since it's a altered virus rather than mRNA, but who knows if that'll hold up since that same garbage website Children's Health Defense comes up with some crazy article saying J&amp;J gives you COVID. 

If you've read this far, thank you. It feels good to type all of this out, I can't really say this aloud to anyone in person since the only people I really see in person are at work and unfortunately about half of them (in healthcare nonetheless!) are also crazy Trumplican / QAnon believers.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,130707,public,confidence,self,Anyone familiar with Children's Health Defender?

This has been going on for a few years now. It started with pizza gate and the flat earth and has moved through a plethora of conspiracies, now it’s 5G. Through the years the relationships my mother has had with members of our family have been strained, some are ruined and now everything is in shambles. She claims that they’re not conspiracies, it’s the truth and she is a proud truther. She says she can’t stop, she can’t un-know what she knows and she is going to figure out the truth of the universe. My mother says it is absolutely possible to know what the creators of the universe know and she has divine wisdom. 
My two younger brothers, dad and I have all tried many different ways to approach the situation. We’ve had family meetings without her to vent and share because she can get very volatile if anything about her beliefs are mentioned. I’ve tried to get her into hobbies to take her away from the iPad, I’ve tried to get her up and moving around to prove that the wifi isn’t crippling her. We’ve tried to be open and listen hoping she would do the same..absolutely not. We are lost, wrong, uneducated, sheep...she thinks her family members are bots. She calls us bots now. 
The weight of the abundant knowledge that she has been retaining is stressing her out to the point of alcoholism. She was an alcoholic 15-20 years ago, stopped for that period of time and now she’s back on the sauce. A mean, angry, spiteful drunk because she doesn’t understand why her family has “done this to her” we won’t join her side. She’s consumed with doom and negativity, pointing that out to her is useless. Rationalizing is useless, logic is futile. Shes  quick to say “no no, thats fear porn I don’t look at that fear porn”...as she drinks and cries because she’s so scared, depressed and stressed out from all the horrible things she knows now. The worst part is during these drunken meltdowns she says how much staying away from the internet would change her life and she knows she needs to stop and she can’t and she won’t try. 
Last year we didn’t talk or see each other for 7 months. I wrote her a very long letter opening up to her about everything..begging to have my mom back. We all want our mom. She passed my house on the way home from work every day for those 7 months and never cared to try to mend things. I’m tired of being the parent. I have to take over her roll for both of my younger brothers as well. I needed a break for my own sanity. Then the holidays rolled around and things sort of were okay so we started speaking again and I felt that I could try to start going to my parents house again. I definitely felt that it was too soon for me as my mother hadn’t changed much and didn’t seem to really be phased all that much by me disappearing for half a year. She’s the type to just repress, bury and not deal with anything at all and just hope a peaceful dinner will cute everything that ever happened, while she continues to act however she wants and knowingly hurt the people close to her. She knows because we tell her and it really doesn’t matter to her she’s the victim of the 5G and a victim of all of us. This woman went as far as to visit 4 different doctors to prove that the 5G radiation is why she’s so tired, can’t sleep, moody, nauseous and just actually killing her. When a handful of tests all came back normal she was just then validated that it is indeed the Wifi and every doctor is an idiot that is corrupt and can’t be trusted ma she definitely and absolutely knows more than all doctors. It has nothing at all to do with her immobile, isolated, anxious, drunk tumble down this internet rabbit hole. Our family doctor refuses to see her anymore. 
Today she told me that she isn’t going to change and I need to stop being judgmental and negative. She doesn’t need help, I need to stop living in the past and accept her. She’s busy solving this mystery. 
When she said “I put the truth before my family” my heart broke....I realize that I really do need to keep my distance from her for my own sake and the guilt is tremendous. The frustration and the bewilderment that overcomes me in regards to this situation are so fucking unhealthy for me, my siblings and my poor dad who has to live with her.

I got out of my ""gung-ho giving a shit phase"" five or six years ago. I moved on from giving a shit about the day-to-day happenings within that ~~swamp~~ toxic waste dump which we know the District of Columbia.


There was a time where I'd be sitting there with some friends watching SNL when a skit would come on. They would say some shit about a political pundit/commentator who was on ""my side"" and would instantly feel that fight or flight response. Hell, one time I saw a TYT logo on my friend's computer screen and I felt that sensation...

Heart-rate goes up, and I would just feel the bad kind of butterflies my tummy. **In a way, it felt like I was physically sick** and I guess this would be a called a physiological response. Well anyway, I took notice of it and over the course of a year or so I worked to be conscious about my feelings and responses to various things. 

These days I'm very comfortable hearing disagreeable political views without feeling any kind of way, no matter how sorely misinformed the person speaking is. Heck, sometimes they have a good point.... Anyway, I'll spare you the whining about how the media never seemed to give DT a break. He can fend for himself, he doesn't need my help, money, or kind words. This is not to say that I didn't think the media coverage wasn't very slanted, I just can't be a fare judge since I avoid the corporate media like the plague.

**Enter the ""Q"" or ""Q-Anon"" movement** (some of them will correct you if you say ""Q-Anon""... lol)


Within a week of election day, I was in agreement with a friend who said that Biden has it because ""you can't recount burned ballots."" Perhaps this is a wild conspiracy theory. I'm not gonna try to convince anyone. What annoys me is, the amount of people who went along with the Q delusion.


There was a chance for Trump's side to be heard fairly on the 6th but due to the events I wont go into detail on, that didn't pan out. Then the Q-crowd continued ""Trump is going to"" or ""Trump has already declared martial law... they are now going to put the fraudsters on trial and hold a new election.""


As we got closer to the 20th, the ringleaders of the Q-crowd knew they were full of shit, so they began to back-peddle and update their narrative. 

On a positive note, I was in a ""stop the steal"" chat group. In the beginning, I was being called a ""Debbie downer"" by someone who kept posting various pipe-dreams. Towards the middle of January, this same person was sounding just like me...... and others in the group were whining that he was being too negative. The person meant well, saw the error in the dis-info they were consuming and revised their beliefs. This gave me a little bit of hope for others.


&amp;nbsp;

Then some weeks back my dad got off the phone with his brother and told me about some BS video that his brother told him to watch. So we both watched it. It was some fat British guy making shit up. Saying shit like ""Biden isn't the real president. He's currently at TV studio version of the Oval Office and Trump walked past the window and waved.""

Like what?

In recent weeks my uncle has revised his.. beliefs. I offered to bet 5 ounces of silver, but he didn't seem interested (I wanted to win an easy bet). 

He basically has a very fluid outlook on things to come. He's not committed to a specific date which means I can't give him a hard time when March 4th comes and passes uneventfully.


&amp;nbsp;


I kinda stopped taking notes and following this Q shit because you can't throw it back in their faces anyway.... they'll just adopt new bullshit when last week's bullshit doesn't pan out. I occasionally leave disagreeable comments on videos but am finding laughing less and less.

To them Qanon proves their ideology right, and it must feel good to know youre beliefs are right. 

My aunt who believes, was always subtly racist, now that she's found Q, she can openly hate BLM loud and proud all she wants now cuz to her its really a shill organized by satanic baby killers to destroy America, she no longer has to doubt that maybe she's the one in the wrong or even listen to what they are saying, 'beacuse its evil', and if it's evil she knows shes right. she gets to keep her slanted views about minorities guilt free, and her world still fits neatly in a box of her right and them wrong. Why is Qanon ripe with racism, antisemitism, transphobia, etc? Because its a means to justify those beliefs.
 
It's much easier to hate someone or be a completely terrible person to ppl if you believe they are child rapists secretly destroying america, or if they would support and/or are supported by child rapists. Thats why they obsess over it, it's not about saving kids, it's about everyone else being wrong/evil. Everything is still just black and white that way.

Not only all that, but they get to live in a fantasy world where they can easily champion themselves as the saviors of children and sex trafficking victims, nevermind they dont actually do anything to help anyone, to them they are actual patriots fighting God's fight, they're the good guys and the ""libruls"" are brainwashed by Satan himself, imagine how morally justified they must feel over everyone else, it's the biggest ego trip I can imagine.

No longer are other ideologies and beliefs subjectively evil to them, but they are truly evil and they have ""proof"" of it now. Anything their opponents do that the Qanon members don't like they now 'know' it's because they have evil alterior motives. It's a shield they can put up anytime to deflect anything they don't agree with.

Hello! My name is Michael Zull and I am a graduate student in the Arizona State University MS, Technical Communication program.

I have read many of the detailed emotional stories on this subreddit. I am truly moved by the support found here and grateful that this subreddit exists as a place that those effected by QAnon can share their experiences. 

I am conducting research studies on the impact that QAnon has had on relationships and the social and mental health impacts that the QAnon movement has had people's lives. If you are a friend, coworker, intimate partner, or family member that has had a negatively impacted relationship due to differing beliefs and support of the QAnon movement, I'd greatly appreciate if you could take a few minutes to complete a short survey to describe your experience. 

[QAnon Relationship &amp; Social Impact Survey @ Qualtrix](https://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3m8qf25ha41PDa6)

The survey starts with 5 demographic questions about the QAnon supporter in your life, and then 10 questions regarding the relationship, social, and mental health impact that the QAnon movement has had on you and the QAnon supporter. It should take you no more than 10 minutes to complete. The survey is anonymous, and all information is completely confidential as no identifying information is ever requested.

This survey is one small part of a much larger study that I plan on conducting about this same topic. I thank you in advance for your time and contribution to my research!

My mother is a well educated black woman and I used to look up to her. When I was going from middle school to high school (I just turned 24) is when it all began. Videos showing men on corners shouting at people how sinful they were (Hebrew Israelites). She started staying up all night watching them. At first it was a dogmatic allegiance to Christianity then it shifted to allegiance to the bible. Now it's morphed into an incomprehensible mess of religion, thinly veiled Islamaphobia/anti-semitism, and of course a never-ending repetition of QAnon/QAnon adjacent conspiracy theories and black supremacy. Yes. You read that right. Black-supremacy. 

When I got into highschool our dynamic changed. I started resenting her. And not in a teenage ""she took my phone"" kind of way. In a ""my mother believes there is a race war coming and that white people will be enslaved"" kind of way. By time I had finished highschool our relationship was in shambles. November 2015, the same year I graduated high school, when Trump was elected she said he had saved the country from Hillary who was a closet lesbian, pedophile-cannibal who raped young girls then ate them, among other things. I've gotten progressively leftist in my views and my mother has fallen deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole. 

I see a lot of people talking about experiences I know well. That shift from someone you love turning into someone you no longer recognize. My mother was never perfect. Emotional and physical abuse was always there on some level. But I never questioned if my mother was proud of me or if she loved me as a young child. And today, I don't question it either. Because I know she doesn't. Because she's made it clear she's repulsed by my ""lifestyle"" and I'm ""brainwashed."" I'll never forget the day she looked in my eyes and told me ""Don't ever wonder if I like you, I don't like you. I hate your personality."" I was maybe 18 when she said that. And I replay that in my mind to this day.

I'm getting married soon and I haven't told her about it yet. I don't intend to. I'm marrying a white trans person. I have no doubt she would highjack the whole thing, curse me out, and try to talk me out of it. ""Inferior blood"" and ""gender confusion demons"" became part of her regular vocabulary early on in the indoctrination. I don't tell her where I live. I don't see her anymore. She calls and talks in a one-sided conversation, where my role is to just say ""uh huh,"" otherwise I risk a fight with her. I don't tell her I'm in love or succeeding in organizations I've founded at my university. When holidays roll around I send her the obligatory text ""Merry Christmas!"" and she responds in kind.  I don't tell her about the friends I have or the traumas I've endured. When I had to deal with being sexually assaulted one of the first things I thought was, ""I can never tell her."" Because she went out of her way to tell me if I didn't stay within her religious protections I'd be assaulted. I don't know which would be worse: her taking it as confirmation to everything she believes and driving her that much deeper into conspiracy or her telling me it was my fault. I'm sure both would happen. I just... don't tell her about my life.

Growing up my dad was a source of dysfunction in the household. He was addicted to opiates and a hard labor worker- coming home in terrible moods, I have many memories of my parents fighting or me being afraid of my dad. As a result I don’t have a lot of memories in my childhood due to dissociation. In my tween-teen years it became the worst. My parents would always have a cluttered house, unopened mail on the counters and whatnot, expect us to clean up their mess everyday after school, and when we didn’t (because what kid knows how to sort their parents unopened bills and mail?) and yell at us for not doing it. They never picked up their own mess and just expected us to do it growing up. My dad would also regularly use the n word, one time I was about 13 put on a pair of jeans and he said I had a n* ass. Always calling people the n word in his stories and he would even call me it like what’s up n-?? I am a young white woman and he is also white. I had to unlearn a lot of racist crap that I thought was okay after I moved out.

Bringing me to Q. When Trump won the election in 2016 I knew my parents were happy about it, my dad got a trump train sticker and a flag. Over the year I noticed he would play YouTube videos constantly, throughout the night and all day when he wasn’t working. Watching Fox News constantly. My sister and I always made it clear we don’t agree and when he talks about this, or anything that he feels he’s right about, he raises his voice and shuts us down, which is extremely triggering from our childhood with him. We are not able to engage in conversation with him about this.

All the while his Facebook is full of Q videos. His Facebook posts would say things like “drain the swamp” or he would end a lot of his posts with just “Q.”

Text my sister and I to stock up on necessities for shut downs that never happened. 

Before 1-6 he was posting in support of protesting the election. I don’t think he supports the violence that happened.

After the insurrection I stopped over and almost made it through the morning without bringing it up. He started talking about Facebook and YouTube censoring conservatives and I had already told him I didn’t want to talk about this with him. Trying to set my boundary. And this developed into him raising his voice about me being “LIED to” by democrats. He was crying (he does not blubber and cry over things easily) over DT being impeached, about the news portraying him and his supporters as terrorists, the look in his eyes completely broke me. I felt like the parent looking into my crying child’s eyes. It was horrible. I told him I’m not going to sit here and get yelled at when I told you I don’t want to talk about this. He stopped and agreed he shouldn’t be yelling.

He has deleted his Facebook, YouTube, and just shut down the family Netflix account to disassociate himself from companies that have denounced DT. My dad was already a paranoid, self isolating person before this and now I’m worried he is losing his sense of identity, isolating himself from the outside world and is probably on some conservative only feed. 

My poor mom just goes with whatever he does. They also don’t really make any effort to see us, hang out with us, they just care about their crappy jobs and politics. 

I’m afraid my dad will never swallow his pride and admit that this is way too much. He prefers this over a real, normal life. 

I’m trying to accept that I’ll never have a normal relationship with my parents.

Their destructive and self-sabotaging beliefs and actions are not your fault. It is who they are and you are not responsible for these inclinations.

I have seen a trend in the posts here, a pattern of ""when we aren't talking about politics everything is fine."" This makes me think of toxic, manipulative and abusive relationships where the victim cannot be convinced they're in an abusive relationship and keeps returning. We warn young people that their inexperience and naivete can lend them in an abusive relationship. I see this happening with the victims in this sub, where despite their (ostensibly liberal) personal beliefs, they opt for a socially apolitical lifestyle and end up in relationships with people whose political beliefs are wildly incompatible with theirs.

""When we aren't talking about politics everything is fine"" is the Qanon equivalent of abuse victims trying to convince others that ""when I don't upset him he's such a sweetheart"" or ""he loves me, really, so it must be my fault I upset him."" The only solution is to educate yourself on political matters and have those discussions. Vet the people you interact with and form relationships with. 

Their ideologies and behavior are not your fault, but please, please don't set yourself up for heartbreak by ignoring the importance of matching ideology in a relationship. You've seen how little it takes to push a Qperson over the edge into full blown conspiracy cult delusion.

I apologize for the ramble, as I am not a scholar on the matter, but it's a pattern I've noticed that I felt was relevant enough to point out.

Other extended family is divided because of political beliefs.

Maybe this is just me, but I think that differring opinions are good for you. I am seeing a lot of people on here (and everywhere else) labeling entire groups of people because of the behavior of some, and I don't think that's the right way to go because then you're just doing the same thing these Q people are doing. 

I have many friends/relatives on the left, center, and right of US politics. I never judge them for their beliefs, nor do I judge my family for theirs. HOWEVER, I do think that *behavior* (whether rooted in politics or religion) is the biggest role in breakdown of relationships. For example, my grandparents think I don't want to talk politics with them because I'm ""becoming brainwashed by MSM"". I don't have time to watch the news, nor am I unaware of biases within them. I don't want to talk with them because of their extremely aggressive (and quite frankly, childish) *behavior*. They have essentially cut off anyone who doesn't go with their theories and spend all day on Facebook (which is now an echo chamber since they unfriend anyone who disagrees). Disagreement is healthy when you can be civil, no matter how ridiculous something (non-violent) may seem to you. This idea that ""If you aren't on my side, then you're bad and I hate you"" has gone way out of hand and it's isolating or alienating many people. I think we all (assuming the majority is sane) have beliefs in common, no one is 'better' than another person for their personal perspectives.

Maybe we should stop judging and labeling each others' opinions and politics and just judge people by their behaviors. I refuse to let opinions/politics/religion become my main course of judgement and as a result, I am exposed to a wide variety of different people, cultures, beliefs, etc.. Exposure is what helps us understand each other. I don't really know why we all have to resort to moving somewhere ""because it's blue/red"" or believing that one place is good because its isolated from blue/red .

That's just really my opinion. I wish more of us could be civil and focus more on similarities than differences, although I do understand why many feel the need to get away from people who cannot do so. My mom, who I moved away from, frequently berated me and wished death on me because of my political views (she wanted to use my vote for her candidate, I refused). My dad and his family were just racist and intolerant towards me (he is a naturalized Korean, and I am first gen half American half Korean). None of them ever called me by my name but instead a Korean slur for ""half-breed"" or ""mongerel"". I don't have any contact with either of my parents because of their radical behavior (and many other reasons). Like I said, I will respect your beliefs, but the respect has to go both ways. Giving ultimatums and freaking out about someone's opinion is really just nuts to me at this point. I read a lot of posts on here that I can unfortunately relate to, and I genuinely hope that all of you find peace in your life, whether that means going no contact, distancing, or apologizing if you have done the same thing a Q person did to you.

I know this because he told me, and that all the banned subreddits were getting picked up by them. I can’t tell if he really believes that there’s a pedophile ring amongst big money democrats and celebrities or if he’s just entertaining the conspiracy like he would UFOs at Area 51. He’s been a Trump supporter since his nomination. Before that, he was into Rand Paul as a hard libertarian. You know, “taxes are theft” etc. 

We fell in love shortly before all the primary politics of 2015 started going down. Before then, I only gave a cursory glance at politics. I had liberal social views that drove my voting but I didn’t really read about it past specific social issues. So at the time, I didn’t care if we had different politics. It had never been a big issue before for me to be different in politics than someone else unless they were ultra social conservatives (of which he was not). 

I didn’t really pay much attention to the primaries. I watched a debate here and there and rolled my eyes as I watched a reality tv star running for nomination. Like many people, I never took him seriously. I thought people would vote for Kasich because he seemed like the only adult in the room. I guess that shows how ignorant and naive I was then. We ended up moving in together 6 months before the RNC nomination convention in the summer.

When Trump got nominated, he started rooting for him. He was one of the “he won’t be the same when he gets into office, he’s just doing it for show” and “I just want to shake things up in Washington”. We debated hotly the whole rest of the election and when Trump won, I cried. I cried because my (at the time) boyfriend didn’t see why I was so upset that this guy got elected. 

For months following, I obsessively followed Trump on Twitter, trying to show my husband that he wasn’t changing even though he won. He said “oh the game is still on, wait until after he gets inaugurated”. So I waited and hoped. He still didn’t change as we all know.

So we fought at each other’s throats for the next two solid years after that. It was the only thing we would ever fight about was politics. Everything else in our relationship was actually great. Our day could be going great and then current events would cut in and it would dissolve into a nasty fight. We couldn’t ever seem to have a discussion because I was so passionate about the issues brought up (think kids in cages, Kavanaugh hearing, etc) that I would see red. Each awful thing Trump said or did or caused was explained away somehow or whatabouted. I logged onto T_D every day just to lurk and see what they were feeding my husband. I still get on TheDonald.win which is now Patriots.win occasionally so I can know what frame of mind my husband might be in. 

Finally, we both realized that the subject of politics was destroying our relationship so we both finally stopped talking about politics. I deleted all of my social media so I could just stay away from the news and only check it once every couple months. Our relationship improved leaps and bounds over then2 years after that. We got married, bought a house and added twins to our family. 

But now I’ve been drawn back into the daily grind of politics and the fresh realization that my husband still visits Patriots.win. That my husband thinks the election is stolen, that my husband actually tried to brush off the murder of a capital officer by saying he died from an embolism. That my husband has “joked” about pedophile rings between top Democrats and celebrities. 

He’s not as far gone as some, at least when it comes to some of the much deeper Q conspiracies. He doesn’t bring up his Trump politics, he’s never worn or purchased MAGA merchandise, there’s never been a Trump sign in our yard. In fact, meeting him you would never guess in a million years that he supports the same guy that the people who stormed the capital support. He’s an amazing dad and really a great husband to me. I tell myself often that I should really just be lucky that the only problem in our marriage is politics but other times, I wish above all else that I could have the amazing marriage without the stain of Trump/Q. When Biden won, many were celebrating on the streets or just at home, crying from happiness and relief. All I could do was stare at the screen numbly, objectively grateful Trump lost but unable to pull up those emotions because my husband thought the win was a fraud. 

So I asked him, if States and Congress certify results and Trumps lawsuits go nowhere, will you finally accept the results of the election? He said yes. But now even though he acknowledges Biden as President, he still thinks the election was stolen from Trump. 

I just want this man (Trump) out of my marriage and I don’t know how to kick him out.

I responded by saying that I know Biden isn't a good person, and I'm sure he's racist as well, but because of the messed up two-party system we have, I went with the lesser evil. Then she said, ""Did you know that it was actually Hillary that colluded with Russia in 2016?"" I asked her for a source and said it's literally been proven that the collusion involved Trump and Russia and she went on to say I have to look deeper, not use news stations as sources (which I partially agree with, they are all biased), etc. She still has not sent me anything to prove that the collusion involved Hillary and says she needs to research it for a couple of hours before sending me a credible source. She also says Trump did not incite violence on Jan. 6th. Another example- we were talking and I brought up how double-masking is now being recommended. She said ""No thanks"". She thinks it's weird that NOW the CDC is recommending two masks. I tried to explain that this is due to multiple strains being discovered but it falls on deaf ears. I also tried to explain that obviously what we are told is best to protect ourselves is ever-evolving because there is still so much to learn about COVID, but she just doesn't want to hear it. She says she isn't going to get vaccinated because it doesn't seem safe, but she's been vaping for years (and obviously there's very little research on vaping and its effects) so that somehow makes sense, I guess? I'm getting worried that her boyfriend is influencing her opinions because I know she has been parroting his views more and more.

Thse people are obsessed with believing in this satanic child killing enemy that they've concocted, and I think ultimately they really don't care if it's true or not, because the truth is it's just a reason to justify their already shitty behavior and beliefs. Take the Conservative Christian crowd thats flocked to Q, they can now easily think of themselves as champions of saving children and sex trafficking victims now, nevermind they dont actually do anything to help anyone, but to them they are actual patriots fighting God's fight, imagine how even more morally superior they must feel over everyone else, it's the biggest ego trip I can imagine. Even worse than that Qanon is ripe with racism, antisemitism,homophobia, transphobia, etc, it draws those people in like a magnet, even if those views were kept private before Q, they can now use Q to express them and not only be justified but feel honorable in it. My aunt who believes, was always subtly racist, now that she's found Q, she can openly hate BLM loud and proud all she wants now cuz to her its really a shill supported by satanic baby killers, she don't have to listen to their struggle and maybe grow as a person, 'beacuse its evil', and she gets to keep her slanted views about minorities guilt free. It's much easier to hate someone or be a completely shitty person to ppl if you believe they are child rapists secretly destroying america or if they would vote for and support child rapists. Thats why they obsess over it, it's not about saving kids, it's about proving all their previously held fuxked up beliefs were right. Uncle Earl from the trailer park whose spent a life time of stock piling guns and hating the libruls, now has a place to fantasize about murdering them because in thier minds they are no longer subjectively evil, but they are truly evil and they have ""proof"" of it now.

I’m in the UK, London, born in Poland but this is my home for 15 years now, around 20 for my mum. Me her were never really that close, I moved out as soon as I could at 18/19 and now in my 20s were started trying to re kindle our relationship but it’s been very tough and slow. A couple months back was one of the first times I feel we had an honest and open conversation as adults about everything, (ideals, morals, beliefs, politics, relationships, race) and all that conversation did was create more divide for me. I realised how differently we think and it honestly scared me. The distance and time between us allowed me to really grow into my own person. In one conversation she told me how: 1) Covid is fake/just flu, government tracking you and all that bullshit, anti mask/ vaccine 2) We spoke about American politics (during the race) and she clearly showed great support for Trump (as much as she tried to hide it and play it off) at the same time accusing Biden of numerous dumb things, mainly the usual pedophilia. 4) Mass consumption of nonsensical media (Facebook) aka. believing anything at face value, never questioning your beliefs and calling someone brain washed if they ever question you 4) Very skewed perception of race and  racist tendencies which I just can’t tolerate, especially as my girlfriend is half black and it’s a massive part of her, she’s passionate about race issues and is an activist. I’m very proud of her and to be with her. My mum has met her but I’m now ashamed to put my girlfriend in the same room. These are the main points but overall I see now we just don’t see eye to eye on many things and at the age I’m at now I’ve developed strong integrity, there is a lot of subjects in this world I refuse to compromise on, (unless I’m proven otherwise of course) family or not. WHAT YOU CAME FOR: A month after this conversation I messaged my mum asking how she is and she told me she HAD covid and she now recovered. I warned her about the danger of it and the importance of wearing a mask and how irresponsible she is, so honestly speaking my initial response was basically a ‘I told you so’. To which she responded that she had Flus worst than this and it wasn’t that serious. Stating that Covid is not mortal. She lost me at that point and I wrote her like 5 big essays of the problems I have with her and her beliefs( For another time). The thing that really hurt me the most, is that she was clearly prepared to die before telling me. I could have lost her because of her ignorance and stupid sense of pride. This ignorance plague is actually taking lives and my mum was lucky to get away. That was one of the final if not the final straws for me. Family honestly means nothing to me but blood, I don’t want an ignorant biggot in my life, no matter what. She’s very hardheaded and I always felt like conversations with her it’s just a matter of who ‘wins’ or shouts louder and I never entertain that, I’ll rather stay quiet because if I try speak rationally explain where I stand I’m laughed at. It’s not my job to to make her realise this as son, it’s so draining to listen to and this was only one conversation. I can’t even imagine what it must feel for you guys out there who have to endure this every day in your homes, and still be strong enough to think logically and not fall into this conspiracy hole. Sorry for venting for so long, I could definitely go on for longer but I just wanted to share my story and I was happy to come here to see others are experiencing the same (equally terrified). This may not have been specifically on the topic of QAnon but I feel this ties in to how people like my mum are so easily influenced by the shit fed to them, often from sources with nothing to back it up and pure speculation and more importantly the impact it had on their loved ones, friends, colleagues.

I have a dear friend who I met whilst i was a university student, and he is my ""Q-affected"" friend. For the sake of ease, I'll just call him K. As a student, I used to spend a lot of time in a certain music/dive-bar, and this is where I met K. His family is very blue-collar, while my father was a professor, so we're from very different backgrounds, but we're still good mates. I don't think his home-life was very stable as he was growing up, and he's got very severe ADHD. He takes medication for this, but he also abuses it like hell. He also smokes a lot of pot, and when we were living together a million years ago, he used to take hallucinogens a lot (and I do mean A LOT).

Pocking around the net I've seen anecdotal reports that mixing pot with ADHD meds can trigger psychotic episodes. K's always seemed ""off"" if that doesn't sound too mean. You can tell there's something different about him as soon as you speak to him, but the last few years have been terrible! He's become something else. For a time, he was living quite close to me and his mental health was just spiralling down out of control. He also got me work, for which i was very grateful, but i was stuck with him day in day out. He was always forcing youtube clips under mys nose (some were flat earth, some were really racist in a truly bizarre way, others were about aliens ... they were ALL stupid).

On July 3 2019, K and I caught up for a drink, and to smoke some pot (yes, I know, I'm a fucking idiot!). He was talking to me about some Q-shit involving the bible. Because i did some units at uni to do with comparative religion, philosophy and classical-studies, K's always asking me about this shit. I'm kind of hyper-secular, but I've always been interested in that kind of thing, and so i know about it. He got very animated about me dismissing it, and was saying that how was he supposed to know what it said (we were speaking about Revelations). I said he just read it himself and gave him an old bible. I know with hindsight that this was a stupid thing to do, but it made sense at the time: I was trying to drop the topic, and thought he'd only glance at before throwing it aside when it wasn't what he expected (he'd done that with Gilgamesh two months earlier).

I assume people here are familiar with the whole July 4th 2019 thing, but just in case, that was when JFK Jr was supposed to reveal that he was alive and start the storm. So apparently K went berserk, because he was arrested and put into psych. He has few friends left, so it was me who had to go in and visit him every second day or so and escort him around when he had leave and stuff. It was really full on. His family moved him back to closer to home, so i don't get to see him as much but I've heard he's doing (marginally) better. He still thinks covid is a scam, but he said something about not believing in Q to me a while ago.

The thing is that reading these posts has made me think that maybe my friend isn't as typical as i thought. It sounds as if most of the people here with q-affected friends speak of people less obviously-deluded than K; people who are capable of owning and running a business etc. Now that K's closer to home he can't smoke as much weed as he likes, and they've changed his medication which had him bouncing off of the walls. I'm hoping that with time his brain-chemistry will equalise and he'll be okay again, but I'm not holding my breath. Are other peoples' q-friends drug-affected and/or got overtly-obvious mental health issues?

Also, I feel I'm missing some detail that prehaps i should understand about the whole JFK/Revelations thing? Does anyone understand that? it just seems a little disjointed, like the two don't belong in the same ""theory"".",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,130276,public,confidence,self,How prevalent is this amoung your Q's,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/liv7pm/how_prevalent_is_this_amoung_your_qs/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cw: sexual abuse. 

They were hippies back in the day. Happy people. I remember 9/11 being the big event that changed them. Made them increasingly suspicious, anti-social, and occasionally bigoted. 

My mom was the one to listen to fringe conspiracy people like Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, while my father was Mr. Rational. A very Romney republican. They bickered here and there. I remember them fighting in 2016; my mom loved Trump, and my dad thought he seemed like an asshole. But that didn't last. 

The Trump era really changed everything in our family. They began seeking out more and more fringe content that spun and deflected from valid criticisms of Trump. Dad went from a ""let's give him a chance, he's a cool businessman"" to ""he's literally the savior of American culture!"" Our house became decorated in Trump flags, hats, fridge magnets, and stickers. The TV was never off. Always on Fox, then Newsmax and OAN. It was surreal. 

But last summer, as the 2020 election approached, they both started getting into Q. 

I tried to pull my dad back (he had previously mocked QAnon) but it was like the more I tried to reason with them, the more they clung to it. My dad's boss was holding Q meetings late at night, with people skyping in from across the country. They went shooting in the forest near Canada to ""prepare for civil war"" with a group led by a couple veterans. They invited my husband and I over for movie nights but then played us Q youtube videos. They blew up at us when they found out we were planning to vote for Biden. My mom essentially said, ""How can you vote for a pedophile like him when I was raped by my father as a child?"" 

By the election, I wasn't speaking to them aside from the occasional small talk phone call.  

Then the Capitol attack happened. They were thrilled and I was horrified - by the attack itself but mostly at their joyous response to the violence. As my dad started texting me instructions to ""prepare for martial law"" and stock up on ""emergency food supplies"" I had to cut them off entirely. Distance wasn't cutting it. Unfortunately I did so through text, but I knew a phone call would get me emotional. I essentially told them that their addiction to Q and the violence was shameful, and I didn't want it near myself, my husband, or our new baby. 

Since then, my mom has sent a few emails to podcasts and websites about the ""cabal,"" I assume trying to red pill me. I've ignored them. Got a new phone number too. 

Today we stopped by their house to get the last of my things from their basement. Old paperwork and business suits, that kind of thing. We had called ahead to be sure it was okay, and was curtly told yes. Saw the dog. Saw my old bedroom. Saw them. Most of the Trump paraphernalia was gone. 

But they were so cold. They made no attempt to hug us or smile or... Anything. Resentment was all over their body language.  

And here my dumb ass had been missing them. Wondering if in the last month something had changed or they'd come to their senses. So many times I've wanted to call and give baby updates or ask for advice or just reason with them. 

But there I was, their daughter, 37 weeks pregnant in their kitchen and it was like they didn't care. Like they've chosen Q and Trump over me, and over their granddaughter.

As we drove the hour back to our house, my head was flooded with small memories I'd mostly forgotten - or maybe pushed away. Racist side comments they made when I was a teenager. How, when I was going through puberty at age 11, my mom told me all men will find me sexually appealing and to be careful - even around my father. My dad confiding in me when I was dating my husband that us being together wasn't a good idea because he's Black and society will target us. Them trying to convince me not to move to Japan and then again the UK because they're ""dangerous"" countries full of propaganda, socialists, and terrorists. 

These comments seem so obvious now, but they were sandwiched between their good aspects, their personalities and hobbies. I overlooked them because I could.

I thought far right media and Q had taken my parents from me and brainwashed them. How else could children of post-WW2 immigrants, Jewish and German, believe such anti-semitic, fascist crap? 

But no, they weren't brainwashed. 

Q puts together all the things they wish were true. It gives them justification for the hatred, bigotry, and fear they used to make an effort to conceal. It makes the violence they want to see somehow righteous. 

I miss my dad. I was always a daddy's girl. And I wish my mom were around to help me give birth and be a mom myself. 

But my daughter deserves better grandparents than them. My husband deserves better in-laws. And I need to stop making excuses for their toxicity, hoping they'll change. It's their own responsibility.

And I think I'm finally at peace with letting them go. I have chosen family that have stepped in with love during what should be the happiest time of my life. My childhood best friend's parents are helping us prepare for baby, and my mother in law checks in often and is ready to come help at a moment's notice. We have great friends who have found a way to be present, even during an endless pandemic lockdown. 

If my parents can't be part of that and prefer Q, so be it. I'm done shedding tears over their choices.

I can’t speak about it to anyone in my family for fear she will find out and tighten the reigns that much more on what is already a strained relationship. 

My sister in law and I have never really seen eye to eye. She doesn’t have respect for me. She lives off playing “Devil’s Advocate” in all posts I make on social media and she uses it under the guise that she is “making me defend my point”.

This past month she took it too far, again.

I freaked out over the transphobic, racist, homophobic posts that were being made from several of my old friends from my small town in Wyoming, so I flat out said I don’t fuck with the above personality types and if you couldn’t possibly be in my social media presence anymore, feel free to delete me. 

She then sent me this long gaslighting text about “what if her kids disagree with me? Would I cut them out too? Would they feel the need to change their beliefs just to please me?” This is not the first time she has used my love for my family against me, and I lost it. I had a full on panic attack and blocked her number after she told me she no longer wanted to see me post pictures of her kids on any social media platform. 

She also threatened to leave a bad review on my FB business page because she scrolled back four years and found a photo I had forgotten to delete. 


I have a twin niece and nephew who turn 1 on March 16th and because of the Pandemic I haven’t even met them yet. I cancelled my flight out there next month because she told my brother if I came there she was going to pack the kids up and leave with them. She is not well, dealing with having fallen down a hole of conspiracies as well as an untreated bipolar disorder.

This is my first post as I’ve read close to a 1 million (seems like it) entries of the same story of individuals that have fell victim to a significant other buried in the qanon sewer.   My wife is one of the most caring,  selfless individuals I have ever known in my life and has literally become a different human being actually wishing for the death of John McCain an old man Bush (a few years back) to hurry up and take place so we can find out the truth about things involving JFK.  Gritting her teeth in anger as she tells me she’ll be so happy when they’re both dead.   
She’s been involved with Q from the beginning.   She is one of these folks that will never let go in fear of how she will look by embedding her self in all of this garbage and doubling down to not be foolish.  (Pretty sure that’s not working)
I would never point a finger and say I told you so, but we are at a point way past just someone being ignorant.  This appears to be a giant mental health crisis that targets the emotionally vulnerable and gullible.   

I can literally tell stories for many many  hours as I’m sure all of you can.

My wife is real big on this financial reset aspect of Q anon. I haven’t seen it mentioned in any of the posts I’ve read and I’m curious is anybody is familiar with the Nesara Gesara    As I understand it it’s one of the oldest Ponzi scheme‘s that it tends to attach itself to any crisis of significance going on in our country.  My wife is telling all of her family,  in which most of them are believers, that there’s going to be a financial reset in which we’re all going to be loaded. Our money is going to be backed by precious metal again and our checking accounts and assets are going to be revalued which could make them worth 5 to 10 times what they currently are. She has our daughter and son-in-law convinced JFK Junior is alive and is behind this and helping the push.  
She keeps telling them every year to wait till the last minute to file their taxes because the IRS is illegal and going to be going away, the banking system is illegal and going to be going away forever, the media will be gone overnight one day, amongst many other things. 

DJT has signed Nesara Gersara in place and will be activated when the new election inauguration takes place in March. I Can’t Even!  

In addition there is an inter-Galactic being called Ashtar who he and many other  peaceful aliens are living and walking among us and helping DJT run things. 
She goes to sleep every night listening to Ashtar YouTube videos.   

At this point the Q army believes absolutely anything they are told and I cannot even get my mind around 1% of the garbage they treat as gospel. I imagine in my mind a table full of hackers in Russia or China sitting around drinking beer joking about the next conspiracy they can put online that Q people will attach themselves to. Currently JFK Junior, Elvis Presley, Princess Diana, Michael Jackson are all alive and well. JFK Junior is coming on the scene any day now to expose himself, and his dad too,  who would be well over 100 years old.   This is so cultish. 

I could go on for hours, but I appreciate this forum and honestly is one of the most civilized ones I’ve ever seen on the Internet. I appreciate everyone’s respect level and courtesy as there are many many hurting people who’s family, friends, &amp; loved ones are completely enshrouded in this ridiculous movement, with no end in sight.

Like so many of the families in the article, my mom had made a complete 360 from the woman I’d known my whole life. 

My mom died from kidney cancer in May 2020 - a crazy story because she had been in remission for 20 years when it came back in 2016 and more aggressive. When that had happened, she had gone down a rabbit hole trying to find natural “cures”, buying expensive snake oil (what I’d call it) and there was no changing her mind about sticking to science and what her oncologist recommended. She was convinced chemotherapy was a Big Pharma conspiracy with doctors to make money and have the FDA not approve these so called cures she was finding. I blame her friend that was a huge conspiracy theorist and from there, my mom drank the koolaid. 

When I found out she voted for Trump, I was astounded. I would get so pissed when she’d talk to this friend on the phone about all the bogus conspiracy theories and regurgitate all the bullshit from Trump. Since she was sick, this should’ve been time to take full advantage of what we had left, but instead I felt our relationship was more strained and weak. I’m an only child, and she raised me as a single mother, so she’d been my rock my entire life. 

I would get so irate when I’d try to find understand why she voted for Trump and one day I told her I’d lost so much respect for her because of it. She was like a stranger to me and I didn’t know what to do anymore. Now, I hold a lot of guilt because of what I said and because we weren’t close before she died.

They both voted for Trump in 2016 but would still talk about how they cringed at some of the things he said. 

Over the past 4 years my mom has grown closer with a friend of hers who is an obsessed Trump supporter--buys his wines, sends my mom Trump bears, etc. My mom never had many close friends as an adult and has completely latched onto this friendship and I think that is part of why she's now obsessed with Trump as well. At the beginning of Covid, my mom was taking the virus seriously but by July she was traveling with this friend to Vegas and acting like it was all a hoax, despite my boyfriend's uncle dying of it a month before. They even went to one of his super spreader rallies and the first Million Moron March in DC. 

Over the past year my moms words and actions have gotten more alarming. She sent me the Plandemic video to watch, blames everything on ANTIFA, believes the election was stolen, said the Nashville Christmas Bombing was to destroy dominion computers stored in the AT&amp;T building, and made comments during the BLM protests that she ""wished someone with a gun would go out and shoot them all"". She also later on told my brother about the power outages theories and a few other bizarre theories that he didn't even want to repeat to me. I got in countless arguments with her over all of this but tried my best to not engage to keep my sanity. We live on opposite sides of the country so it wasn't in my face 24/7.

On January 6th she posted praising the insurrectionists calling them all patriots and that a ""sleeping lion had been awakened"". I deleted her on all social media and told her over text message that I no longer wanted any kind of relationship with her, that she was in a cult, etc. She told me to ""stop drinking the koolaid."" Irony...

A few days later she posted on Facebook saying we need a new civil war and went back in forth with a guy in the comments about how veterans will be on their side, how they all have guns, etc. Since I was no longer FB friends with her, I only found out because multiple people screenshotted it and sent it to me because they were concerned and asked me to report it to the FBI. I don't think she would act on anything violent but at this point I feel like I don't even know this person so I just reported it to be safe. An FBI agent ended up contacting her and talking to her on the day of Biden's inauguration and she lost it. She ended up figuring out it was me that reported her by going onto my email (I didn't know she had the password) and finding my emails with the agent. She told my brother that she knew it was me but has not confronted me yet. She instead keeps doing little things to try to get a rise out of me to start an argument so she can bring it up but I've just been not engaging at all.

I have such a strong feeling of guilt over this because my mom has always been very emotionally manipulative and raised me to be extremely dependent on her. She would get jealous if I had friends in high school, wouldn't let me get summer jobs, always bought me things to hold as leverage in arguments, etc. She didn't talk to my godmother for 10 years because she told her that we needed friends other than our mom. I think it's ultimately a good thing that I'm being forced to be more emotionally independent now but it's really difficult for me since it completely goes against how she raised me and I feel like I can't even talk to her now.

It honestly feels like my mom is dead because I don't recognize her anymore. I don't even know how much of a Qanon follower she is because I have virtually no relationship with her anymore.

Because of course you have every right to traumatize your grown son and reduce him to nothing as long as you call it “love”.
That was a half-year ago. They’ve only gotten worse. My father is constantly soaking up whatever lies Newsmax and OAN leaves for him, yet remains utterly complicit whenever the subject is discussed, hardly ever speaking at all. In that way, he’s almost playing the neutral party, never approving but never disagreeing either, just going along with every little thing. I’ll label him the judge by that logic.
Corresponding, my mother is the jury: she gets to decide what stays and goes, what’s real and what isn’t, what’s considered truth and what’s considered blasphemy. She’s been on a rampage recently. She’s gutted our extensive family movie collection because she thinks that Hollywood consists of Satanist pedophiles. She’s broken the family budget and cluttered up our already-too-small house my buying way too much food to stuff into pantries we don’t need, all in the name of “preparing for the End”. She’s driven away every friend of our family we’ve had for several years with her rhetoric. I won’t even get into what exactly that rhetoric is; you probably already know. 
Finally, my brother is the executioner. He is fully and completely willing to cause harm to defend his Big Lie. He says so constantly. Every chance he gets, he just loves to harp on about how much better America would be if we simply ordered a Nazi Eugenics-like killing of all trans people. Or if we ordered the genocide of all Muslims in this country. Or if we abolished the Democratic Party in favor of a neo-monarchy led by Republicans (which would be fascism, of course, but to him that’s a good thing).

Unfortunately, 90% of the posts are about kids who have lost their parents to Q.  I'm a mother who lost my best friend/daughter.  She and I were like 2 peas in a pod.  We talked every day, got together with our whole family (there are 15 of us) for every birthday, anniversary, graduation and, really any other occasion we could turn into a celebration!   I'm a Democrat.  She became a Republican when she married her husband, who I adore(d).  We NEVER had so much as a disagreement about politics.  It was a ""non-issue.""  At least it was until 2015.  Her change started shortly after Trump announced his run for the presidency.  She started with ""Pizza Gate"", then claimed that Bill and Hillary Clinton had Vince Foster killed, as well as Seth Rich.  It just went downhill from there.  Conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory.  

The last time we actually spoke was in Aug.2020.  We hadn't seen each other for a while, so I called to invite her to Starbucks for coffee.  The first 30 minutes was fine - just small talk.  Then, she brought up Barack Obama who, by the way, she had voted for in 2008.  She mentioned something about his middle name, Hussein, being a Muslim name.  I realized at this point where the conversation was headed.  We had already had ""the birther"" conversation in 2015.  I wasn't going to have it again.  I stopped her &amp; said, ""We're going to have to agree to disagree on this.""  Then I stood up, hugged her, and said, ""We need to set boundaries in the future. I don't play the 'conspiracy theory game. I have to go. I love you. Bye.""  That was pretty much it.  I haven't spoken with her since, although I did hear that she, her husband and 2 teenage kids went to DC on 1-6.  I don't think they went with the intention of getting involved in the violence, but nothing would surprise me.

I don't want to break any rules about sharing articles, but if you want to google it, it's ""The Unlikely Connection Between Wellness Influencers and the Pro-Trump Rioters"". I didn't realize that my sister was most likely deep in Q or Q-adjacent shenanigans until I read this. She used to be a nurse working in emergency room/trauma centers. She took a swift right turn about a year and a half ago and suddenly was very into the spiritual and wellness community on instagram. Quit her job and moved out to AZ to create videos/posts that promoted her particular brand of feminist-led spiritual health and wellness. Not for me but I like to think I'm supportive. 

In the beginning of the pandemic she made a few posts about not needing to wear masks and how your aura can protect you from covid, a little disappointing to read to be honest. Around August 2020 she announced she was selling her possessions to car-camp full time. Interesting but ok. After some more questions, she announced to the family via group facetime that 1) 5G is for microchips and any covid vaccine will have a microchip in it B) on Nov. 3rd they will shut off phone service and electricity nation-wide and C) there will be a real life purge as the Democrats revolt against DJT's inevitable win. The cherry on top was that she had ""received all this information within a 24-hr period"" and that is ultimately why she feels safer if she were camping out in the woods when all that goes down. 

She has always been very careful to not pick a political side out loud (as a few members of our immediately family are very left-leaning). She has never once said the word ""Qanon"" so I'm not sure if she even realizes where she is getting her info from. I truly don't think she supported DJT, she believed she was just warning us of what was inevitable.

Nov 3rd came and went and yes there was some tension and confusion across the nation, but none of the things she claimed clearly have come to pass. A final prediction she made was to share a video with the family in which a well-known wellness guru (and I guess political commentator) explained how a Real Civil War might still happen because yet again Democrats won't accept DJT's win when the election results finally shake out. We all know who was declared the next Pres and what happened on Jan. 6th and she has been radio silent about politics ever since. She will still occasionally post things to her instagram such as ""just because someone thinks differently than you doesn't mean they are a conspiracy theorist"". But again doesn't claim to be a part of Q and I don't even think she knows the true source of the claims she was spouting. 

I hope she is in the clear as I have not heard anything about March 4th from her and she has returned to a nursing job for the time being.

But I feel bad constantly crying on the shoulders of my friends who have their own problems to deal with. So I'm going to post here, mainly to get this off my chest.

I am planning on getting married in May after a decade with my partner, and postponing from 2020 due the pandemic. We are endeavoring to have a safe, socially distant, healthy wedding. I am encouraging everyone who is able to get a vaccine beforehand to do so. (I have pre-existing conditions that allowed me to qualify for the first phase in my state, and have already received my first dose.) Now, I understand that not everyone will be able to get the vaccine by May but I have helped a number of my friends who qualify, and their elderly family members get vaccination appointments over the past couple of months. I'm endeavoring to help at least 80% of my guest list vaccinated before the wedding. This will not be a superspreader event, not on my watch.

Now we come to my mother. She is eligible for the vaccine but she refuses to get it. For years I have watched as her conservative leanings have become more and more extreme. She is fully indoctrinated into QAnon at this point. She is constantly spouting propaganda and conspiracy theories at me and will not listen to a single thing I say. She refuses to get the vaccine, or even consider wearing a mask to protect others. 

Nothing has caused me more pain and stress during wedding planning than my mother. Not the pandemic, not the health concerns, not the fact that we had to postpone and change all of our vendors, not the amount of money we are spending, not the fact that I still don't have a dress, or any of the other things that are reasonably giving me anxiety. 

Because on top of all of this, I've had to deal with numerous texts, messages, and e-mails from my mother over the past several years telling me how I've been ""brainwashed"" by my liberal education (that I went into debt to obtain because she was never willing to help me) or by the media. She seriously thinks that I'm part of a Marxist/Communist agenda trying to take over the country (because I am technically a member of the horrible ""media"" that she hates so much and I'm also very much a leftist). She constantly proclaims that we just ""shouldn't discuss politics""  but takes any excuse to rant at me about her abhorrent alt-right beliefs and how I'm the hateful divisive one, not her. This includes almost every conversation we have had about the wedding. 

For years she has been emotionally abusive, and manipulative. But she still thinks she has the ""right"" to attend my wedding and that I should bow down in submission to her simply because she is my mother. Last year I bent over backwards to secure a (very expensive) new venue with lodging simply so she could stay there on Friday night (she converted to Orthodox Judaism over a decade ago and cannot drive on Saturdays). 

Recently I told her that she could not come to the wedding if she wasn't vaccinated. In some attempt to ""compromise"" she claims that she'll get a Covid test before traveling to Pittsburgh. But even during that exchange, she was hurling abuse and alt-right propaganda at me. Putting me down, rewriting history, making herself into the victim, trying to guilt trip me, gaslight me, and emotionally manipulating me into doing what she wants. I wanted her to be there because she is on my only living parent. But I don't want to risk the lives of my friends and partner's family by having her in attendance. 

I just don't know what to do. I tried to cut off contact with her five years ago after the election and I was a fool to reach back out to her and think that she might ever change. 

I already took her off the guest list after the last hateful rant she sent my way. That was after I tried to give her a chance to condemn the actions of the insurrectionist mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th. But she just doubled down and started spouting rhetoric and propaganda at me once again, belittling me and saying terribly cruel things about who I am as a person, because I'm a ""baby-murdering liberal."" 

Just this week she tried to wheedle her way back into my good graces, but that of course quickly devolved into the same old fight. Nothing I have ever said gets through to her. She doesn't listen to me. She doesn't respect me. There is no regard for my boundaries or my wishes. She claims to love me ""FOREVER"" but what kind of love is this? Her involvement with QAnon is paired with her long history of abusive and manipulative behavior. I have begged her to seek therapy, so she has someone to talk to who might be able to help her understand how much this is hurting her children. But she will  not listen to anything I say. 

Additionally, she does not seem to understand that my issues with her stem from her beliefs and her involvement with QAnon. And that her attitude about the vaccine is only a symptom of a much larger sickness that is living in her head.

It's helpful to read the stories and heal on here, if that's even possible rn. Honestly I don't know. I noticed my parents going batshit crazy for the first time roughly a little over 4 years ago. They've always been anti-government and weird, but that alone didn't seem odd at all. As time went on they started telling me things, that even though I had not thoroughly researched the topic, I knew right away something was off. Like normal, smart people, especially the ones I looked up to and was raised by, don't say this bs. I brushed it off for a while and thought, ah mom must have read something weird online NBD. A couple more years went by and I started recalling the monthly predictions and irrational BS they had been spewing for years. I told them their track record at predicting literally anything was terrible. Nothing they had ever been consumed by or warned me about over time had come true. Then along came Q. I learned about it and could go back bs story by bs story over the years verbatim. I was shocked. I could also find the meme or false information going around and predict what they were going to say next. No one was ever held accountable after something they said would happen didn't happen. But don't worry, next month it will, or next fall, or next summer. It's always down the road. The goal post always moves and the cult lives on. I started having conversations with my parents explicitly about the stories they were telling me with a ghost white sincerity in their eye, and showing them how easy it was to debunk. I showed both of them several times step by step how to check multiple sources on anything to prove if it was real or not. I warned them about the places they were getting their information (blogs and YouTube University). I also told them to be careful about everything they saw on FB etc. They just listened and then told me they don't trust Wikipedia or mainstream media. Any of it. So they had successfully dodged my educational debunking seminar. They told me about the Cabal and pedophile rings, specifically ALL of the Democrats and Hollywood Elite and how the President was a ""brave hero"" akin to Jesus/God. President's word was gospel, and really Q. Besides that everything is wrong. I argued for years. I debunked for years. Being raised religiously I shuddered at ""their"" idea of religion considering who they worshipped. It had nothing in common with Christianity or it's principles. I reminded my parents that pedophile rings exist in all organizations around the world in different places at different times and there was no ""secret"" about it. I realized that all the things they had been saying about Democrats over the years that was completely insane came from these memes and Q blogs. I mean, party aside, really crazy shit. I bit my tongue through ""the government is tracking my phone so I have to turn off the gps"" and the ""I use an untraceable browser so they can't see what I look up"" and even the ""Government is controlling the weather/Chemtrails"" phase. Still not sure why the last one was even created, but hey why not. I started avoiding conversations with them. I wanted to salvage what, if anything that was left of our relationship. I sat through the ""5G"" and the ""Microwave poisoning"" and the "" Blue light from technology "" glasses that they wore. I really didn't know what to do. So Covid comes around and naturally like any good Doomsday prepper would do, they informed me that ""Martial Law"" was unavoidable and I had to always have food and water and a full tank of gas and hey, why don't I just come hide where they lived to escape it for a little while. I argued and got verbally abusive, because I knew they were FULL OF SHIT. Being recently unemployed I decided I could go for a little while. I have many other siblings. They were only able to scare one other to come up. So nothing happened. The trip was stressful and my ability to avoid or stay quiet around my parents was becoming impossible. I left. My parents don't believe Covid is real. They are anti-masker anti-vaxxer Qanaons. Even after all of the Medical professionals and immunologists etc share their knowledge. Even after my sister had it and was hospitalized and has long lasting effects because of it. Even after I've had 8 friends lose someone in their family because of it. Even though my dad is or ""was"" a medical prefessional and so are 2 of my siblings. I've lost my mind with this. I had been telling my mom respectfully for 2 years on a weekly basis, ""Do not send me messages or include me in group messages that have anything to do with Politics or conspiracies"" It never worked. I had to block her number. I had to get verbally abusive and yell. I have tried as an adult human being to gently and respectfully explain the TRAUMA that I experience when they spew the Q to me. As a growing older child I am learning how to love myself and reduce toxic relationships. I DO NOT call my parents because of this. I have tried everything. I have tried to talk. My mom turns into a defensive child. She still doesn't even know what the hell is going on. Their behavior has REAL WORLD effects on people, including her children. All of them have distanced themselves. I am the only one taking a stand. I realize I speak from a place of privilege, growing up with both parents, trust me. I said ""goodbye"" to them last year. My mother blames me, thinks I am being too harsh. I've been sober for 15 years, and my mom even tries to compare it to all the shit I put them through with my drug use and years. If this is payback, I'll take it, sure but I have to show tough love. I haven't even been able to tell my parents about my personal life for 2 years. I know I am validated in my actions, for my own protection at this point. I am in survival mode in my personal life. I am alone. I never thought the internet would take my parents from me. I am an orphan. Thank you for your comments and letting me vent.

I think he’s overall disgusting, but I’m a ‘conspiracy theorist’ and that gets cross referenced with trump frequently. 

I am curious, when did you learn about qanon? Do you deny their legitimacy due to their association with trump, or have you always disbelieved what they say? And my final question, would you be able to digest their claims if they ever were proven true?

Anonymous has been around a very long time. Qanon is said to be a far-right conspiracy theory but I don’t think it’s valid to place them ‘right’ or ‘left’. 

There is a lot about this virus that doesn’t add up. People dying from it said it wasn’t real. Nurses in overflow hospitals say it’s not as contagious as it’s promoted to be and there’s no clear standard of who is and isn’t vulnerable. Governments have historically done what the conspiracy theorists claim they are currently doing. Pushing for globalization, centralized global government and economy, taking clothes off our backs that we don’t have to gain foothold in other countries in need, I mean the proof is in the pudding..

The history of how the Holocaust evolved from an election to a genocide corroborates well with what has happened in the past year. Czechoslovakias civil war fits the amount division the media seems to be pushing on us. 

Mind you, conspiracy theorist are not against you. They’re against people who want to take advantage of our country as a whole. They’re against a government who has clearly been manipulating us, and the world overall, for centuries. They’re against the times that our leaders committed genocide (and they have, refer to Native American history). Propaganda is very present in our media, social media, communities, whether your right or left. Black or white, citizen or alien, gay or straight. 

Just think for a second why you don’t believe the theories. The people who convince you they’re fake, are the people who have the most to lose if you believe them.

I'm white, female, 40, married with two kids, and a SAHM. My husband and his family are all conspiracy theorists and I've been really lonely for the past four years. I don't have family close by and this was a nightmare for me. 

My husband and I both voted for Obama and were on the same page when we met in 2011. We married in 2012, and were able to talk calmly about politics. 

2016 my husband became a different person. Suddenly he started becoming meaner and more distant and very rigid in his thinking. He stopped helping out with chores and started spending alot of time online. Then he started talking about Q. 

He is a Redditor, and I do blame Reddit for this partly because Reddit is where he got his content. 

Politics became a hot button in our house. He got very angry at being questioned and started a narrative that I had TDS, Trump Distortion Syndrome. Any kind of discussion inevitably led to a fight. He stopped parenting, and became a fun time dad who didn't feel he had any responsibility toward normal things, like homework, dinner, cleaning.... He started groping me at odd times like when I was distracted and kept saying that by withholding my breasts I was alienating him. 

When that was met with distaste on my part, he blew up, and that became his personality. Everything became my fault. His parents moved to Florida? That was my fault. The laundry piling up? Also was my fault. Literally he was able to blame me for almost everything. 

His narrative changed again and suddenly it became his job to keep everyone in line although he himself slept in, didn't cook, didn't clean, didn't help with the kids, and spent all of his time online, only running to talk to me when Q made another drop. Finally, I asked him to stop talking about it and to find something else.... that something else became video games. 

He became a person I didn't know and he still is. I thought that Bidens inauguration would snap him back out of it, but it hasn't. He was absolutely a mess the day of the capital riots and became angry, vengeful, and the emotional abuse kicked up yet another notch. He still believes the capital riots were necessary.

 Finally I had to get his family involved because he refused to go to counseling and was sleeping all day and being awake all night. He started ruining my sleep cycle and I became so exhausted I couldn't mentally or physically function and became a shell of myself. I would try to take naps during the day, and he would sleep until 1 and wake up after the kids were gone to school. I would be trying to rest and he would literally bust open the door turn on the light and demand sex. 

I am now so uncomfortable around him that I avoid him during the day and generally as much as possible.

QAnon, you can have him. I do not want him anymore and our marriage has dissolved into a pile of shit. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 

He realized how abusive he was being and now he has shut down. That's fine with me because I don't want to talk to him anyway. 

I handle the parenting independent of anything he does. I now have taken on his chores and my own and there are no thank yous. None are expected. He's allowed to live his life on his own terms because now none of his bullshit makes an ounce of difference to the day to day living of our family. He can read his theories all day and that is his new life. 

The only thing he has successfully kept going is his job. If he loses that, I'm taking the kids and leaving him. 

Hopefully QAnon will let him keep that at least.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,129827,public,confidence,self,Hi! Here on anon account.

Totally new to reddit, just reaching for a support group over the alienation and isolation I've felt more and more since Trump's inauguration and much more so since the pandemic began.

I've always been close with my mom.  She and I have always debated politics.  Though we disagreed on policy, you could call politics one of our go-to subjects.  That began feeling less rewarding and/or engaging when Trump won in 2016, but has become intolerable since 2020!  

We live in two totally different realities.  There is nothing I can say that she doesn't brush off as my being brainwashed by ""MSM"" (main stream media).  There is no proof I can provide her that she doesn't deflect as coming from a lying, deep state, or otherwise compromised source--this happens regardless of providing her news articles or primary sources (government reports/data, transcripts, etc).

She spends her time consuming alternative media, giving her alternative facts, creating an alternative reality!

While we used to speak almost daily--hours throughout the week--I've talked to her 2-3 times in 2021.  Not at all since the inauguration.

I'm sick of this shit!  Trump, Fox and further-right media are directly responsible for the alienation we all feel from our friends and family members that have fallen for this QAnon/adjacent nonsense.  Further, America came into this pandemic with everything going for it from a healthcare standpoint.  Trump and right-wing media are responsible for America's despicable response to the pandemic, thus responsible for the excessive deaths/disabilities caused by covid and the isolation caused by excessive lockdowns!

I ran across an article about folks losing people they cared about to QAnon.  I have heard of QAnon but never thought anything of it as I have no interest in hearing what they have to say.  That being said, my brother joined a cult and moved to Mexico a few years ago and I did a ton of research on that cult in order to get him to see reason.

Fast forward to today when I read the article about QAnon.  There are a number of similarities to the cult my brother follows and QAnon.  While I understand that the whole cult mentality is to use fear and confusion to gain followers, there are things that make me think they are linked and perhaps being ran by the same group of people.

The thing that caught my attention was the mention of lizard people.  The cult my brother follows believes that there are also lizard people that have put scales over our eyes to hide the truth.  I havent done research into the amount of cults that believe in lizard people but it seems obscure enough to raise a red flag for me.  

I am not going to give the full background of the cult because I do not want to give them any more attention than they are already getting but the cult was started by a man name Raymond Lear.  Long story short, there was a weird light over a temple in Jerusalem back in 2011 and that was when he was turned into ""the Lord"" and now goes by lord ray-el (who is supposed to be Jesus).    


Doing some digging, the group from Baja Mexico as been out of contact since the begging of January due to being on a ""special mission"".  Perhaps it is purely coincidence or perhaps it is correlated.  The group like most cults, is all about power and money.  One of my brothers jobs in the cult was to reach out to embassies and consulates to let them know of ray-el's return.  I cannot help but wonder that perhaps combining religion and politics would get them more followers and more money.  The way that they use fake new to push their agenda is also super similar.

It would bring me immense joy to bring down both cults and bring that group to justice if what I suspect is true.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,129795,public,confidence,self,Odd connection,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lii3yj/odd_connection/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They believe there is a race war happening, and will get worse since the vote was 'stolen'.

I’m an only child to a single mother, I only have two aunts and one cousin. After January 6th I have been estranged from everyone in my family except my cousin (also struggling with her parents being Q sympathetic/extreme proTrump/conspiracy theorists) and my grandmother who is the only older adult in my family I am able to justify continuing to have a relationship with despite her believing Trump is a saint sent to save everyone due to the fact she’s so old and may not be around much longer. 

I just had twins last year so it’s been really difficult not to have my mom around because she was such a good mom to me when I was a child. 

After January 6th I gave my mom an ultimatum- you can continue to be addicted to conspiracy theories or you can have a relationship with me and your grand babies. She literally chose conspiracy theories. The more I think about it, the more it hurts. And then continued to talk about how sick it is of people (antifa according to her) to dress up as Trump supporters to storm the capital. I had been talking to a therapist for a few months before this trying to learn coping skills to make it all make sense and try to navigate boundaries in a different type of relationship with my mom. So this was the final straw. 

I knew things were getting bad when she literally brought her computer with her to my twin sonogram appointment last year and was Facebooking sharing conspiracy theories and pro-Trump propaganda from the waiting room.

Their beliefs are getting more erratic, (though they were always a bit strange) ranging from the idea that trump was prophesized to win the election, to biden is a satanist, power outages incoming, the military will help trump (somehow they will take down pope francis in the process), and the capital raid was done by antifa bussed in and paid for by joe biden. They are storing bags of rice now in case of some ill defined food shortage.

So you would think that she is getting more mean and hostile in the process of getting more into Q... but actually the reverse is happening. 

I got married three months ago. My family is largely white with german background, but my wife is vietnamese. But my mom instantly started treating her... nicer than she does to her own kids. She goes out of her way to make her feel welcome, has never said anything ecen vaguely directly hostile to her, and went out of her way to help her plan a chinese new year party with my family, which is something we obviously never did before then. And she even wanted to find videos to teach my nieces and nephews about it so that they would be familiar. My mom acts afraid to even make her upset, and will change the subject if she is starting to say something she thinks is upsetting her.

As for me, I get the indirect benefit of the fact that she apparently doesn't want to do anything to *me* that might make my wife upset. A huge change from how she treated me a year ago. Not that she was always hostile, but more than she needed to be for sure. She still acts passive agreasive to me about political things, but now usually ends it and moves on faster.

Now, obviously Q is not what is making her nicer. But its just a bizarre tension with the fact that she is getting nicer at the same time as her beliefs are getting crazier. (And believe me, they were already crazy).

Since its not making problems for me, I would just wait for it to blow over... but there's an issue. She is trying to spread her craziness to my nieces and nephews. Openly telling them that antifa attacked the capital and the media are covering for them. My nieces and nephews' parents are conservative. They aren't as extreme, but... they are conservative enough that they will bend over backwards to avoid challenging any conservative slant. Even if they aren't quite Q, they don't like challenging my mom, and even worse, don't like challenging conservatism. So they seem to be in a place where they'd rather avoid talking politics with their kids, and give only the most vague of an indication that my mom is going too far, since they don't want to challenge anything my mom tells them is some type of core conservstives belief. Its a wierd situation.

So my mom and my other sister are basically trying to brainwash the kids into Q. I don't want to challenge her much too directly since she is acting nice, and my abused-by-her-own-family wife really needed a close family replacement. So rocking the boat isn't a good option. And she is long past the ability to actually care about evidence. (Showing her bad stuff trump did in the past is met with the excuse that he used to be bad but is a changed man). 

I can't try talking to the kids too directly, since my ability to get time with them is largely predicated on not bringing up anything their parents don't like. Politics and religion being a core one. No one in my family knows my exact politics, but for that reason most, be they left or right are a little suspicious of them. I just use it as an opportunity to avoid pointless arguments. 

So I'm in this kind of peculiar position. How can I keep the kids protected from Q nonsense without it looking like I'm talking to them about politics?

I stopped watching political news and reading politics on Facebook because it was consuming me. I couldn’t handle it anymore. She continues to do so and was “groomed” by her sister.

I should also point out that I believe in truth, science, and rational thought, as well as in social acceptance but fiscal responsibility in government, and am registered as “undeclared”. I read journalism that is well researched and void of opinions so I can form my own.

I’ve been trying to talk to her about this stuff since just before the election when “the change” happened but I keep failing miserably! I get too excited and judgmental and now she won’t even read letters I’ve written disproving these completely irrational beliefs she has. I’m still in shock because she never said anything about her beliefs on these subjects before. I feel blindsided and betrayed because I always thought we had the same beliefs on these matters and she always seemed as revolted as I was about what was happening.

I told her that I hoped we could cut the subject of politics out of our relationship completely.

I feel like I’ve been holding this in for months. 

My father has been quite conservative since I was a kid. My mother is more liberal, and my siblings tend toward libertarianism—meanwhile I’m very left-leaning. Through high school and into college, my dad and I disagreed on a lot, but we could discuss it (sometimes at length!). I felt like he valued my thoughts and listened to me. We live in a rural area and I think my father doesn’t make friends easily. He’s often turned to online groups for company. 

Over the last five years he’s taken a slow dive into theories and rhetoric that sound more and more Q-adjacent: cracks about the Obamas, George Soros, and transgender “agendas.” Trump could do no wrong. The past year everything ramped up. He’s said things like “I don’t think that the virus is all that bad;” regarding my aunt (who has diabetes, and is very careful about COVID as a result) he tells me “She’s scaring herself about COVID.” He wears a mask, grudgingly, but says things like “I’m a free person.” And he seems to really believe that the election was stolen in a mass conspiracy by the Democrats. I recently found out that a close friend of his attended the Capitol rally in January. When I try to discuss things with him, he brings up statistics and talking points I’ve never heard of, which all seem to be misleading or misreported when I dig into them afterward.

 I feel cut off from him—we’ve talked less and less, and while I miss him I also feel that nervous twisting in my stomach when I think about calling. I know his and my mother’s relationship has suffered, which worries me too. And my father and I work in the same line of business. We have many connections in common; he introduced me to several business partners and friends—all of whom want nothing to do with QAnon. I feel terribly guilty even thinking these thoughts, but I’ve wondered more than once if I may someday have to reforge those relationships or lose them to awkwardness if they find out about my father’s leanings.

I’m 18, but I live at home for the time being since my college is close by. 

So naturally, when lockdown started, he refused to enforce our state’s mask mandate in his business. My mom is a nurse, and we both had huge fights with him over it(she’s into conspiracies too, but nowhere near as far gone). No matter how hard we fought, no matter if I refused to speak to him or the fact that this nearly ended his and my mom’s marriage, we could. Not. Get him to put on a damn mask at work. It was a huge victory when he’d wear one to the store. Eventually, we sorta forgot about it, since he became more distant as I revealed that I...you know...took the pandemic seriously and all. Eventually, I ended up in the car with him around New Years, and he called his secretary(and sister...who’s probably even more into Q than he is) to tell her he would be in late because I was having car trouble. 
Well she sounded HORRIBLE, she could barely talk and she was coughing every other word. I told her that she needed to leave immediately, because she was obviously sick, but dad cut me off and said “we need her in for a meeting today, I don’t care if she’s sick or not”. Dad went to the office, and then my family saw my grandma for New Years.(she lives very very close to us and I didn’t want to go, but when you live at home with a very “we’re the parents and you’ll do what we say when we say it” family there’s not much you can do) 
As you might imagine, dad was coughing his lungs up the entire time, and I tried my hardest to avoid him, but two days later I started coughing too and mom generally felt like crap. 
For context, mom has a preexisting condition(type 1 diabetes), dad’s lungs are shot from years of heavy smoking, and my grandma was finishing up recovery from a knee replacement. Mom was able to get tested immediately since she worked at the hospital, but I waited a day since I had so little energy I couldn’t drive myself. In the day we waited, mom came back positive, dad refused to get tested, and CONTINUED TO GO INTO WORK. He told mom that she “wasn’t really positive” because “the hospital gets paid every time they get a positive test” and that “[my name] won’t test positive because she’s being tested by the health department” 
My results came back positive
He shut up pretty damn fast about that
After this, we all assumed that he just had covid, because we had to get it somewhere, and begged him not to go to work and spread it further, but he claimed he was fine, and that his work was more important, so he continued to go
Mom almost divorced him over this. 
She should’ve 
Skipping ahead to the end of my contagious period, I ended up in the hospital because of how short of breath I was. Since I’m 18 and they wanted to do some kinda high demand tests on me, I ended up staying overnight in Pediatrics instead of going to the emergency room. Because I was in Peds, dad was allowed to stay with me(because he would’ve ended his contagious period before me, and mine was over) The doctors were great, but he insisted on borderline yelling about his conspiracies the entire time(it was around inauguration day at this point, so he was gearing up for some violent bs I suppose) and hoo boy did he have some problems when the doctor told me he had received his second shot that day. 
The doctor while trying to make small talk asked me if I planned to get the vaccine, and my heart sank. I had been avoiding talking about it with dad for genuine fear of being kicked out, but I couldn’t tell the doctor I didn’t.
So I told him the truth and said as SOON AS POSSIBLE, the second I could get in line I wanted the shot, because holy shit covid sucks and I never want it again. 
Dad was pissed at me, and after I got home(tests came back okay, no heart or lung trouble, working on getting an inhaler cause breathing is still hard almost two months later)  he gave out my number to all his work buddies so they could send me vaccine conspiracies and Q stuff. 
I’m an 18 year old woman...excuse me if I get angry when my dad gives my number to strangers more than double my age to harass me. 
I had come to terms with really losing dad back in the fall, but to think he would knowingly endanger my entire family hit me in a different place entirely, the effect is still felt at this house, and mom and I still suffer from breathing issues and low energy. I’m a dancer, so not being able to breathe well is agonizing for me in the studio. 
I genuinely don’t think I’ll ever forgive him for this, he still doesn’t wear a mask at work, or make anyone else wear one either, us getting sick AGAIN is honestly likely. My parents try to control my finances as much as possible, and I can’t get a job currently, so I can’t move out to avoid the mental and physical harm of living with people so divorced from reality. It uh..sucks pretty bad, sorry for such a long and incoherent vent, I’ve been lurking here for a while n made an account to get it off my chest.

She's a high-level narcissist. She listened religiously to Dr. Laura and consumed a lot of Fox News. When I came out as trans to her she apologized to me for all the hateful things she said about other trans people by saying she was still learning... later on, I found out that my Aunt--one of her sisters--has been trans this whole time (my mom's family is from the Philippines, where trans people are more common and accepted), revealing that whole ""just learning"" thing to be a lie. Earlier during the pandemic, she kicked my sister out of the house after a fight about washing dishes. When I asked my mom how she could vote for Trump despite my own experiences with sexual assault, she replied with ""You never told me that,"" as if to gaslight me into thinking I never confided with her about the biggest trauma of my entire life, which I \*did\*.

I wish I could hate her and yet I still love her and worry constantly about her. Even just last May, when the pandemic was still in the beginning stages, my mom was very careful about wearing masks, washing hands, taking everything seriously. That all changed in summer, when she found some sort of far-right podcast. In just a matter of months she went from a regular Fox News watcher to a Breitbart commenter, and then later a Q espouser. I keep trying to tell myself not to feel sorry for her, because this was always how she was deep down, yet I can't really commit to that. Even with how conservative she was in the past, she still seemed to ""love"" me, even in her own toxic, weird way. Now not even that is left, and I've been blindsided by how fast the change has been. In less than a year from when she first started listening to those podcasts, she began to beg our entire family not to take the vaccine, that Bill Gates and China orchestrated the pandemic, that Gavin Newsom is a plant sent from China, that the face masks are the same as armbands in Nazi Germany.. She'd stockpile food telling us that martial law would be declared soon. When doing the laundry, dad would find that she stitched the words ""MAGA"" and ""TRUMP"" into her clothing. She even bought a gun, despite having never been interested in firearms before, and started to install some kind of anti-riot bar on the front door... even though she and my dad live in a gated community. She isolated every one of her brothers and sisters. Even one of my other aunts, a vocal trump supporter, has said she had to stop talking with our mom because ""she's lost it"". Mom has even ended her closest friendships because they don't believe her conspiracy theories. My dad will soon be leaving her, he's just fed up with her sending him conspiracy images and texts day in and day out. 

She was always deep down like this, yes. And yet, she's also a completely different person. Any semblance of love she was holding onto is gone now. And I want so desperately to say good riddance and never think about her again, yet I can't. Every day I worry and mourn and grieve for her and who she used to be. Even with how shitty she's been in the past, I feel like I've lost someone. Even with how bad she's been, she's somehow gotten \*worse\*, which I thought impossible. 

It's been hard to confide in my friends because none of them know what this is like or what I'm going through. All of my lefty friends like to make jokes about Qanon and Trump supporters and how stupid and crazy they all are, and I can't blame them because it does feel that way from the outset. But I can't bring myself to laugh with them, and if anything it makes me uncomfortable. That ppl can derive some kind of schadenfreude in something that has managed to dissolve my entire family from the inside out, that's turned every conversation in the house into a tense minefield, that worsened all our lives as my mom refuses to wear masks and brings germs to my dad and drives both of my sisters out of the house. She's completely alone now, and even if that's what she deserves, it still sucks to watch her spiral further and further.

On January 5th, I found out that my mom was not going to Stockton to visit family, but instead flying to Washington D.C. to take part in the protests. The day after, the insurrection happened. And while none of us know for sure whether or not she was with those people who broke into the Capitol building, what we do know is that, either way, she's not just toxic anymore, she's flat-out dangerous. Something activated her. Something told her to go to D.C. on January 6th, a day that these Q-ers have been actively planning. What's left is not the woman who raised me but some kind of soldier for a holy war that doesn't actually exist.

I want my goddamn mother back, warts and all. I hate that that's something I have to say, and I hate that even my closest friends can hardly fathom how to comfort me. I always stuck my nose up w/r/t reddit but I've just felt so alone and reading that huffpo article that came out today only made me feel more depressed.

My parents, while republican and evangelical, have been negative on Trump and QAnon. They've expressed that those in their social circles who are Trumpers, Qultists, and antimaskers are kooks, but..... I still worry they're still at risk for being radicalized. They still easily associate with these people who spout political bullshit, they don't pay attention to news journalism because ""it's all for ratings"", while they believe covid exists they're lax about masks and distancing, their casual racial biases means they're not exactly positive on progressive movements like BLM, and both of them spend a lot of time on the internet-- my mother on FB and my dad on YT.

I don't know if my mother has been Completely taken over by Q but I think she's well on her way there.
This is mostly just to air out my dirty laundry, though if anyone has advice that would be greatly appreciated. :)

My mother is a well-meaning and kind person, and I love her to death. Unfortunately, she's fairly deep in right-wing conspiracy theory and I'm afraid sooner or later she'll start believing actual QAnon conspiracy. I know exactly how this descent happened - she's a very devout Christian, watching sermons on Youtube and such. When I had complained to her about Trump back in 2016/2017 she initially agreed with me and said that he truly did sound like a horrid man, and so she looked him up on Youtube to watch anything informative. I believe her Youtube algorithm sent her more right-wing leaning videos bc of her search history (what is it with American Christians and being right wing? lol). And it only got worse from there.
She doesn't believe in ridiculous statements like 5G causes cancer or anything and is not an anti masker/covid denier, but she's wholly convinced that the 2020 elections were rigged in Biden's favor, that ANTIFA were responsible for the Jan. 6th Capitol terrorist attack, and that the COVID vaccine is dangerous and won't get it until basically everyone else does and is aware of any long term side effects. It's caused deeper strains in my parent's relationship to the point where my father sometimes vents to me about her.
By no means do I blame my family's religion by the way - I am a practicing Christian myself. What hurts the most for me is the way the algorithms and other right wing figureheads manipulated her into believing all of this, despite the fact that my sister, my father, and I have disproven her statements multiple times.
I'm 21 years old and still live with my family due to the pandemic - otherwise, I would be on campus at my college. Cutting my mother off entirely is a rather unrealistic option for me due to having four younger siblings (I'm the eldest child). While the rest of my sisters are aware of how ridiculous my mom sounds sometimes my brother soaks up everything she says, and that's what concerns me the most. Cutting her off from my life would give me guilt about being unable to watch over my brother along with fears of losing my first language (I speak to my father and one of my sisters almost entirely in English, along with my friends and partner.)
I'm wondering if I should sneak her phone away from her for a bit and completely wipe all of her Youtube search/view history and subscriptions and replace them with, well, Not conspiracy theorists.

Q-Anon is now doing this with families all over this country, and even around the world. After I started to doubt certain things about the cult and it's teachings, we managed to get out - and started researching cults voraciously, wanting to know how we were so ""gullible"". (We weren't - we were targeted and lied to, but that's another story). It is my hope that what I've learned about cults through researching for many years, along with what I am witnessing now from my own family members, can help others at least understand better what is happening to their loved ones who have been caught by Q-Anon and who have turned against their families in the process.

I have learned much about how yesterday's cults kidnap people's minds. But now, I'm seeing something terrifyingly different. Normally, cults operate from the top down, with one charismatic leader dictating cult rules and behaviors. They can be politically based, or religion-based, etc. But what we see happening with Q is different. It is a melding of two very cult-like mindsets into an online ""super-cult"" that has combined the worst aspects of radical politics with the worst aspects of radicalized religion. It didn't start out being the most powerful brainwashing tool on the planet, but it found a niche and exploited it - and in the process, created something so powerful even the original group that created it could never have foreseen.

It survives and changes based on ""new information"" but always has one main goal - to destroy anyone, any group, or anything that dares question the idol/leader, and to constantly instill fresh fear into it's adherents. The combination of these into a fear-based super spreader cult mentality has created something that is more instant and interactive than television, and that grabs it's followers and turns them, literally, into individuals that are incapable of rational thought. They have been conditioned to believe only Q, or the idol/leader. No information that, even in the slightest way, deviates from the information being supplied by Q will be accepted by the adherents. In fact, many have pledged their devotion to the cause so deeply that they are more than willing to die for the cause. Q encourages adherents to ""do the research"" but in actuality the ""research"" is just articles and videos that support the premise - whatever that might be.

One really unfortunate aspect of Q is that it latches onto the idea of religious fervor, and that its adherents are doing what is “right by God and for God” by believing all of the stuff Q tells them. It mixes religion and politics in a way that is almost impossible for someone on the outside looking in to penetrate. It radicalizes even moderate Christians into zealots who believe that only Q and Trump have the right answers, as Trump has been “ordained, blessed and anointed by God” – probably the most dangerous statement ever made in this century. Their love for God and their faith is hijacked, reversed, and put on steroids. Instead of love being the most important commandment, hate toward those who are not Christian is emphasized and violence/war is presented as “holy” and “for the cause”. Everyone who does not stand for Q or Trump is definitely NOT Christian to the followers of Q. Everyone who doesn’t believe Trump’s continual stream of lies and hate speech is suspect. Everyone who tries to preach a more moderate, loving version of faith is ridiculed and cast aside.

Personally, I've seen the destruction first-hand that cults can do, long before Q. And now, some of my family have been drawn in and they have completely removed any contact with my family over their belief propagated by this super-cult. I see the hate, the rage, all of the things that keep them addicted to the cult. And Q keeps a steady stream of fresh hate and fear going to their adherents. The adherents also contribute and in turn produce more hate and fear and suspicion. It feeds on it's adherents and the adherents feed on themselves as well - and don't hesitate to turn on anyone who is seen to be disloyal to the idol/leader, which right now is still Donald Trump - however the idol can be replaced, and will be replaced when the effectiveness of the current idol is no longer serving the cult well.

**The only effective way for someone to get out of a cult is for them to come to the conclusion on their own that the cult is not what it purports to be.** It is a process of realization - and it can only come from within themselves. Others can point the way, and in the days of ""deprogrammers"" they can point the way very forcefully (sometimes illegally, back in the day). But regardless, it is only the adherent who can extract themselves from it, because it is actually a prison of the mind, and that prison is also designed and forged with thick iron bars and walls of belief to keep them in. They are constantly being told that anyone outside of the cult is ""dangerous"" and ""lost"" and ""ignorant"" and ""the enemy"". The cult will use every lie and apply every kind of psychological pressure in order to maintain control. There is no easy escape. Those trying to help others get out of the cult must exercise patience, empathy and understanding - which is also hard to do when cult members are constantly assailing them, insulting them, threatening them, or otherwise using any and every cult tactic to push them away.

Because of the power of instant information and technology, what used to be limited and more fringe has now become mainstream, including cults - and Q is just the first hugely successful online-based cult that has utilized both old cult tactics and new social media tactics in order to snare its adherents. And because the online relationship is directly into the adherent's mind with no filter and no checks or balances, it is exponentially more potent and powerful than cults of yesterday. It is direct, it is designed to be addictive, and it uses hate, fear and dopamine rushes to completely take over the mind of it's target. **It is very much like a new and super-addictive drug.**

**The only true antidote to a cult is information.** But in this case, the cult IS the only ""true"" source of information - an idea drilled into the minds of those who participate over and over again. The ""fake news"" media, the ""lying politicians"", the ""unwashed masses"" - all are suspect and none are to be trusted. Family members who try to step in and talk sense are immediately shut down, sometimes in a fit of rage from adherents whose ability to accept information contrary to the cult has been completely cut off. They cannot and will not listen to outsiders. They will not accept that they are wrong. And they will not ever be persuaded by angry arguments around facts, because facts are relative to the whims of the cult.

One technique that has been successful in breaking through to some Q-Anon adherents is supplying them with passive information that is sent to them without conversation or confrontation (i.e. via email, for example) - information that lays out in detail why certain beliefs of the cult are wrong or harmful. Preface it by saying that you know they like to research, and you hope they would take a look at some that you’ve found. Letting the adherent believe that they were the one doing the research that led them out of the cult is key, because only they can free themselves from a mind prison they have been led into and have maintained themselves. Nobody can force you where you don't want to go - however if you believe you were the one wanting to go, getting there is ultimately possible.

I hope that those out there who have lost or are losing family members to this dangerous and absolutely insane cult are able to find ways to bring their loved ones back, or at least to understand what really happened to them - for while we are all ultimately responsible for our thoughts and actions, there has been simply nothing on this planet that compares to the power of Q-Anon to snare someone's mind and not let go, causing pain, untold heartache, anger, violence and raw hate to families, institutions, governments, and countries. I believe the third world war has begun, and the battlefield in this war is the battle for our minds. It is not a stretch to believe that, as we have so tearfully witnessed almost half of our country fall into this mind trap called Q-Anon. I have lost family members to Q that, ironically, tried to get us out of our cult many years before! I wish all who are going through this type of situation all the best.

I’ve been reading through the posts and I finally feel like there are people out there who are sane and rational.

Basically my entire family, immediate and extended, are die-hard Trumpers. I had to block my dad from social media because of his hate-filled, fear-mongering posts. He is OBSESSED with Trump, he genuinely thinks that piece of shit is like, the second coming of Jesus. He’s asked me a few times if I wanted to go to dinner with him to have a “fact-filled conversation”. He came by my house to pick up my daughter for a night, and he spent the entire ten minutes ranting about how Kamala Harris isn’t actually black, Biden is going to cause me to lose my job (I work for Chewy.com, so I’m not sure how that’s gonna happen), and how the entire country is basically going to collapse without Trump. His racism has also been put out there for the world to see.

I’ve never had a great relationship with my dad, so his crap doesn’t surprise me, but what breaks my heart is what happened to my mom. The most empathetic, compassionate, and loving woman I know has turned into a full-blown Trumper and Qer. She really and truly believes that Will Smith and Tom Hanks are cannibalistic pedophiles who sell children to other celebrities to rape and eat. She has become so racist and radical, she refuses to shop at Target anymore because they support BLM, has thrown out all her makeup that are from black-owned companies, etc. She posted something on her business IG a while ago that was something about executing members of the Deep State. That was the first thing that I saw from her about this bullshit. She’s sunk so far into it, it’s actually scary.

Also in my whacko family are my grandfather, who referred to masks as “slave harnesses”, and my great aunt who swore that the QAnon Shaman was a “BLM guy”. When he was identified as the Shaman, it was radio silence from her. She also claimed it was BLM who stormed the Capitol in Trump gear because there were photos of them holding up one fist, the “BLM signal”. Never mind the fact that there are numerous photos of Trump doing the exact same gesture.

I feel like a man adrift in an ocean of this insanity. To date I've lost my sister to this nonsense and several close friends. My sister is probably the most disappointing because she's a extremely intelligent individual who has been a teacher for more than a decade. But I digress...

I'm from a town in eastern Ohio that is predominantly  white Trump supporters, we have the occasional liberal or Democrat but for the most part its lower middle income Republicans. The next town over houses 2 bars a small gas station and a 100% Caucasian population. It would probably be a sundown town if they knew what that was. In other words I'm completely surrounded. Being small towns everybody knows everybody, everyone is friend on FB. So at the start of this pandemic when I first heard of Q and everything that it entails, I noticed that it was always being shared by the owners of the bars and their regulars/ friends. So doing my civic duty, I'd point out the flaws in their logic and the facts that could be proven fairly easily. It would end with name calling or them flat out deleting my comments to try and make me look nonsensical. But I never stopped, I wasnt going to let misinformation be peddled unopposed. It continued on like that, small back and forth until Fall. 

Now fall rolls around and election is coming up, the things they're sharing have become increasingly insane and at this point it's the entire town joining this discussion about the storm and the deep state pedophiles(which happened to be any celebrity that spoke out against Trump. Imagine that). And those that havent blocked me are increasingly ignorant. I've been called mentally handicapped and it's been inferred that I shouldn't be allowed around my infant son because I'm a pedophile supporter although not in such friendly terms. But right before the election it goes all out, I have an argument with one of the women who own the bar and her friend. Then next thing I know I have their husbands and their friends(including several with fake names like Underhill from out of state) in my DMs telling me they're going to sexually assault my wife and kill me and my son. My mom's life is threatened, and I'm basically told by several people that if I show up in town that they'll never find my body. My cars windows get broken, tires flattened,  and my house gets paint thrown on it. 

I get cops involved and they basically do nothing which I expected because of the level of political affiliation involved around here. The cops just tell me to avoid that town. A resident I considered a friend of 20 years told me  that I probably shouldn't get gas in that town anymore, to not even drive through it. They blitzed my FB page and reported everything clear back to 2014, so I've basically served consecutive 30 day bans since the end of October. I've got six days left, hopefully I can manage to stay on this time, I think I've deleted and scoured my friend lists to manage to not be banned. I ended up getting my concealed carry and getting a weapon for protection. I'm probably going to end up moving. 

All of this because I wouldn't let their echo chamber go undisturbed. An entire town just swallowed by this shit. I was never ignorant, never name called. I was just persistent to the point where I was the topic of conversation in the bars every night. I've pretty much got them all blocked now so they cant get me banned from FB but my friend tells me they're all still circle the wagons for March 4th. Just riding the wave of insanity.

They don't talk to me any more, and I've basically had to grieve them as if they'd died. 

So thank you for sharing your stories. They've really helped me process the loss.

And that leads me to my real question: Is anyone interested in some realtime chat about this on Clubhouse? 

The reason I ask: When I left my faith several years ago, I started a support group for those in my shoes, and...gosh, it's hard to overestimate how healing it was to talk to people who were going through the same hurt and sadness as I was. I love this subreddit for much the same reason, but I also feel the need to talk to folks in real time, to listen to other stories, and—maybe—to collectively brainstorm ways to move beyond this. Coincidentally, I just got a Clubhouse invite, and it seems like an ideal platform to get direct conversation going about this.

Is anyone else interested? 

If so, I'll organize. (I'm new to this, but shoot me your screen names, etc., and we'll figure it out.)

My mom.  I love her and dislike (not hate, it's a strong word) her at the same time.  Why?  I am 13 years old and live in an upper-class neighborhood. I believe she went down the q path back when I was 8.  She took away all electronics, and shut down wifi from 9 pm-8 am, due to *radiation!?!?*  

Then, at age 10, we started hanging out with these new groups of families.  We would all meet up at someplace, and they had cool kids that I would hang out with.  But now, looking back, I realized, that she was shedding old friends.  Lifetime friends since *she* was 8 years old.  These great family friends I had, she got rid of due to the fact that they were doctors and believed that vaccines were safe.  TF?  My mom would yell and scream at them on the phone, about how bad and terrible all these vaccines are, and it's all for depopulation, and control, and money.

Now, here we are in a pandemic.  During the start of it, she started getting heavily into q anon, she then proceeded to shed all friends that didn't think this pandemic was planned!  So from doctors to anti-vaxx moms, to now plandemic friends (that's what she calls it. an f-ing *plan*demic. )  And now trumps our savior, since the beginning of quarantine.  Newsom is a baby eating dude, who wants to shut down the state for control.

You know, yesterday, I had a *huge* fight with her in the car.  About this double masking stuff.  I somewhat agreed with her that it is, just a tad bit extreme having to double layer something.  Then, she said how they (who da f\*\*k is THEY) want to stop normal human function.  And then I said, ""what?""

""Oh ya, they are doing it to shut off human connection""

Then I said, that way too extreme, it's just breathing through a cloth.  and that it's not a big deal to have to talk through it.  and *they* definitely do not create masks with the sole purpose of destroying human connection.  and then I asked why the hell would *they* even do that.

""Control.""

Then we had this huge argument about how *they* are not trying to control us, and that how they're shutting down the world for more control.  On and on and on, until she was screaming at me.  A grown woman, screaming at her 13-year-old son for disagreeing with her.  

Then she proceeded to taunt Me:

 "" Oh, yeah \[my name\] go get your fucking vaccine, and drink and eat poison.  well I am not going to take care of you fat ass (funny enough, I am diagnosed as underweight.  I have to eat, *a lot* in order to feel full. I think it's my metabolism. also I am going through puberty, burning calories), and I won't pay for your medical bills.  you can go to hell""

Yep, my mom said that to me.  We have conversation like these weekly, and I am the devil who wants to join the sheeple, and my mom is trying to save me.

Then, she goes on to say that she wants to have an equally respected opinion like me.  Well no, mom.  you can't yell at me for 15 minutes about how I am wrong, and that you are right.  And no, you don't respect *my* opinion, but I respect yours.  very well. 

Mom, I know you can't read this, you don't even know I have an account.  But if you could magically read this,  I do respect your opinion, it's just that you yell and get aggressive when people don't believe you.  well, you don't believe me.  that's fine, agree to disagree, but no.  that's not enough for me.  I have to believe you, or else you yell at me and others.

And, then worst of all, my little sister, believes all that my mom is saying.  and it's frustrating, but then again, my sister has the right to believe what she wants.

AND, In case you haven't noticed, my mom is a Karen.  she will make a grocery store minimum wage worker, have the hardest hour of their lives, trying to make my mom wear a mask.  that's a whole different story.  I may write it up, but not now.

Thank you everyone for, if you have read my whole post, for reading it.  I had to get this off my chest. It's been driving me nuts. welp, nothing I can do about it.

I don't know if he's exactly Q, but he's been very far-right, fundamentalist, evangelical for as long as I can remember. Doomsday prophecies and satanic panic have been a cornerstone of his rhetoric forever. In 2008 he was quick to jump on the ""Obama is the Antichrist"" train so when Trump came along in 2016 I suppose my dad did see him as a savior.

Since Trump lost the election in November, I've been very worried about my dad. The day the race was called my dad threw a huge tantrum and dramatically destroyed all of his Trump campaign gear, and told me that the end of the world is coming and I should get right with Jesus. My dad would cry apocalypse wolf frequently throughout my youth so this didn't exactly alarm me. What did scare me is that he developed a really nasty streak of COVID denialism that culminated in him saying he would not take the vaccine because it had lead in it and would change his DNA.

My dad is damn difficult but I love him and I don't want him to get sick, or put my chronically ill mom or brother that he lives with at risk. It's been a rough few months, but as a family we've convinced him to bring his concerns about the vaccine to our family doctor instead of using talk radio as his primary source. His position on the vaccine has softened a lot and I think we have a great chance. 

He knows I'm interested in learning a new career and sent me pictures of the CNC machines at his work this morning - the pictures were really terrible and all I could see was his reflection on the doors and that made me laugh.

I’m not here to pushing Christian beliefs nor to deny the validity of them, simply stating my opinion on a tactic that may help when trying to pull loved ones out of the cult. Anytime God or the Bible is brought up to argue a point, I research what the Bible really says about that matter. If I find contradictory verses then I present them. Again this is not about religion itself but the more you can get them to question what they are being told by Q and QAnoners, the hold loosens. Another thing is many of them thrive off of emotional responses. When they know they can’t convince you, they dig for them. If you poke fun at them, they usually either lash out or shut down but either way they’ve stopped listening to you. I know I’ve seen it mentioned before but I’m going to say it again anyway, the best approach is presenting evidence, learning everything you can about a particular subject so much so that the information you give them let’s them know or think that you’re more knowledgeable about the subject than they are and they really haven’t done the research they should have (not condescendingly), ask how certain facts fit into their belief or conspiracy. If they are avid Trump supporters and look to him as the savior of the free world, find ways that he ties into certain conspiracies and contradicts them. Stuff that is reported and known for a fact. He took the credit for low gas prices, then tell them all about the Russia/Saudi Arabia price war. They’re anti-foreign friendliness and collusion, tell them all about him jacking up hotel prices for foreign favor. They think he’s about saving children and stopping human trafficking, tell them all about the Prince of Dubai and what he’s done to his daughters and wife and how he started the Dubai Global Women’s Forum where Ivanka was a guest speaker last year. Tell them about his reported monetary ties to two of the Covid vaccine companies, last reported in 2017. Ask them how Bill Gates can own all patents to all vaccines if the Trump Administration had just funded research for and purchased as many as 6. I once fell for QAnon “red-pilling”. Thank goodness I was only under for about two weeks. Those two weeks though I was honestly losing my mind one day at a time the further I got down the rabbit hole. Someone saw a window of opportunity when I started having doubt in what the media was saying vs what I was seeing with my own eyes via live feeds of the riots. Of course now I know exactly what was going on but at the time, that person fed me enough to send me into a spiral and believing that Trump might really be the ‘gooder’ guy. What sucked me in was a whirlwind of information, lots of little verifiable truths. If I had stopped at the beginning I might still be there. Luckily, I’m an avid researcher. I research objectively from all sides and the further I dug into everything, nothing was really as it seemed. The inconsistencies, the absolutely far-fetched conspiracies like reptilian aliens the cabal JFK Jr, all things I never believed but had to just ignore. As well as the detestable crimes and behaviors of Trump himself that we were told to ignore because he only did those things for the “greater good”.

i've always had kinda a rough relationship w my parents, like borderline emotionally abusive. we used to yell and argue and i would cry multiple times a week because of them. still, i thought nothing would ever stop me from loving them. i thought maybe it was just a teenager thing and once i got into my 20s or moved out things would change. i'm 17 now and i don't know if i'll ever really love my mom again.

when she first got into qanon(around last april-before that she was a democrat for her whole life), i still had hope for her/our relationship, but she's genuinely become such a mean person since then. when we argue she makes fun of my voice, the way the face i'm making looks, the words i use, etc. it's so frustrating because i would never say that shit to her. it's not only completely irrelevant to the conversation but also just rude. i've pointed it out before and even said it was immature and she always responds with something about me needing to ""learn social manners"" and things like that because she doesn't like the face im making. the thing is i've really never been making a face?? like it's always at the most random times and i've never had anyone else(even ppl in my family who would be comfortable w telling me i look angry or something) say stuff like that to me.

since i was around 13 i've had pretty bad depression and anxiety and at the beginning of quarantine it got even worse. but since november i've really been getting better and working on having a more healthy lifestyle. i feel like all my internal struggles are almost gone now, but when i argue with my mom it's so hard not to spiral. i've gotten better at not crying when we argue, but after every argument we have i go in my room and cry for a long time. i know it sounds dumb but the way she is just has such a big effect on me.

even when we used to argue all the time, i didn't feel like this after. i feel empty and like this huge part of my life if never gonna be the same. the mom that goes on qanon rants is not the mother who raised me. she's a completely different person. she used to support blm but now that's a cult, she used to be a democrat but now they're communists, and she used to care about lgbtq+ rights but now it's unnatural. these might just be her ""political"" beliefs but it's changed her completely as a person, even in the sense that she's way more irritable/angry all the time now.

i hate it because sometimes we'll go for days on end with no arguments and life feels somewhat normal again. in a way it's worse because when the inevitable argument comes im slapped back into reality, that this is what my life and my family has come to. to make it even worse she's been convincing my brother and dad to believe in it. they don't really say much about it so i'm not sure where they stand but my dad is a republican so i feel it might be easier for him to be drawn in

i think the worst memory i have of my mom now is the day she told me about qanon, and i did nothing. she came into my room and was all excited because she ""knows i love conspiracy theories""(i did when i was like 14, and i would watch shane dawson youtube conspiracies. not really comparable to qanon.) she told me there was a thing called q and they've been predicting stuff that's happened. i had heard of it maybe once before and knew it was some right wing thing but i had no idea the extent of it. because of that i acted super uninterested and pretty much jut didn't respond. she left and seemed kinda sad almost? bc i wasn't interested. that memory always makes me cry. maybe cause she was like excited about telling me? it breaks my heart to think if i knew more at the time i could've told her and stopped her from ever getting involved.

the things she's said and ways she's acted are just so horrible. i've tried so hard to get over it and act like when i move out it'll be fine because we won't have to talk about it again. but she's in deep and i've tried so hard to get her out, i don't think she'll ever be my mom again. this person she is now is not somebody i love.

Later I showed her some videos by people I prefer listening to, namely Shaun's video where he responds to Steven Crowder, and a couple others by CCK Philosophy and 3 Arrows. Her response was to dismiss it all as part of the woke crowd. I figure there is no arguing with her. I dont know if she believes in Q specifically but she seems to be going down that road, where hatred of lefties seems to trump (heh) any rational based worldviews. I dont know how anyone can look at Ben saying ""I have more Twitter followers than you"" and think that this is the type of thing a great thinker would say. The video on Crowder was basically calling Steven Crowder out for denying being a racist yet using the same arguments racists use. So if she thinks the video is woke, does that mean that she agrees with Crowder when he says black people are genetically predisposed to being dumber than white people? I dont want to know. 

What hurts is that she knows I'm on the left, when she seems Shapiro demonizing leftists as stupid and emotional, does she not realize that Im the target of his disingenuous mockery? Does she think that little of me that she has a cult like admiration for a guy who spends his career trying to humiliate people like me? That I'd appreciate being introduced to his brilliant mind? 

Yeah, I can't wait until this period of right wing fascism is over. I get nostalgic for the days of 2008 where we all naively thought racism was solved. Fuck Shapiro for doing this to people, fuck Trump, Bannon, whoever the fuck Q is, for trying to stoke the fires of hatred like this.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,128150,public,confidence,self,An old friend is crawling down the rabbit hole.,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lhcb94/an_old_friend_is_crawling_down_the_rabbit_hole/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

subreddit. I\'ve got quite the conversation to share and I hope that sharing it can help somebody who might be going through something similar. I\'m all really sorry for anyone who is going through something like this. I know what it\'s like. I\'m also hoping that sharing my story will help me deal with my own anger towards my mom. Estranging her has been the most difficult thing I\'ve ever done, maybe aside from getting divorced but I\'m not sure. Solidary laughs and gasps appreciated, and if you decide to share your story, I\'ll do the same.\n\nOn Jan 6th, when, you know, \\*gestures to the news\\*, I couldn\'t believe what was happening and started ranting about it to my Mom, who I know voted for Tr\\*\\*p twice. Get a load of these responses:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ktowq1tecrg61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf52796646af07a85617fcf4c1b8a041c5c5115c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pccqopazcrg61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b2490d325e89ed5a64b44a0c463a27b12f93e6c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h45utgo6drg61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a6e13a7fd0a6b84db6f61fb061df141a0614b72\n\nI literally yeeted my phone across the room after that and spent the rest of the day in complete bewilderment. You know, like everyone else probably.\n\nAfter a few days and much discussion with my therapist, I sent the following message to discuss boundaries, especially when it comes to conspiracy theories that have to do with Trump, the right-wing, Q, etc. etc. you know, stuff that isn\'t rooted in reality. Here was my message to her:\n\n&gt;Hey Mom, I wanted to talk to you about boundaries. I know you have anxiety and struggle a lot with it, and I do too. So I understand how difficult having bad anxiety can be. But it\'s crossing a line when you try to make your anxieties MY anxieties.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My ex used to do this to me all the time. He would often check his pulse and would ask if I could check it too. He would be anxious that he was having a heart attack. But his pulse was always normal, maybe even a bit on the slow side. He\'d get extremely angry when I didn\'t believe him when he\'s said he was having a heart attack. When I\'d present to him evidence that he was not having a heart attack (his BPM), it would be met with anger. He never really wanted me to check his pulse, he just wanted someone else to reflect and validate his fears. We\'d even end up in the ER and received long lectures from annoyed doctors who had actual heart disease patients to attend to. He\'d do this kind of thing over and over in different ways, from ""heart attacks"" to ""ruptured spleens"" to ""blood clots in the leg"" to ""autism"" to ""the FBI being after us.""  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The reason why I\'m telling you this is because you are doing the same thing to me. Here is an example: \n\n\\*inset screenshot of some of the above screenshots\n\n&gt; I\'ve tried presenting you evidence to the contrary, much like I did with my ex and his ""heart attacks"", but you don\'t want to look at facts and evidence, which tells me you are really just wanting to get me to the same levels of fear that you are feeling.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You\'ve done this for as long as I can remember. I remember you accusing me of giving blowjobs in the bathroom stall at school even before I knew what that meant. I have countless memories of being told that the world is going to end in the next couple of years and to brace for the apocalypse. You\'d tell me to always be ready to die for my beliefs and I\'d have nightmares about being crucified on the cross because of what I was taught to believe. I could never, EVER imagine telling my children something like that to scare them even if it was a fear I had myself.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Again, I understand that anxiety is very real and very difficult to handle.

You know, like everyone else probably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few days and much discussion with my therapist, I sent the following message to discuss boundaries, especially when it comes to conspiracy theories that have to do with Trump, the right-wing, Q, etc. etc. you know, stuff that isn&amp;#39;t rooted in reality. Here was my message to her:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hey Mom, I wanted to talk to you about boundaries. I know you have anxiety and struggle a lot with it, and I do too. So I understand how difficult having bad anxiety can be. But it&amp;#39;s crossing a line when you try to make your anxieties MY anxieties.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My ex used to do this to me all the time. He would often check his pulse and would ask if I could check it too. He would be anxious that he was having a heart attack. But his pulse was always normal, maybe even a bit on the slow side. He&amp;#39;d get extremely angry when I didn&amp;#39;t believe him when he&amp;#39;s said he was having a heart attack. When I&amp;#39;d present to him evidence that he was not having a heart attack (his BPM), it would be met with anger. He never really wanted me to check his pulse, he just wanted someone else to reflect and validate his fears. We&amp;#39;d even end up in the ER and received long lectures from annoyed doctors who had actual heart disease patients to attend to. He&amp;#39;d do this kind of thing over and over in different ways, from &amp;quot;heart attacks&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;ruptured spleens&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;blood clots in the leg&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;autism&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;the FBI being after us.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason why I&amp;#39;m telling you this is because you are doing the same thing to me. Here is an example: &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*inset screenshot of some of the above screenshots&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried presenting you evidence to the contrary, much like I did with my ex and his &amp;quot;heart attacks&amp;quot;, but you don&amp;#39;t want to look at facts and evidence, which tells me you are really just wanting to get me to the same levels of fear that you are feeling.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve done this for as long as I can remember. I remember you accusing me of giving blowjobs in the bathroom stall at school even before I knew what that meant. I have countless memories of being told that the world is going to end in the next couple of years and to brace for the apocalypse. You&amp;#39;d tell me to always be ready to die for my beliefs and I&amp;#39;d have nightmares about being crucified on the cross because of what I was taught to believe. I could never, EVER imagine telling my children something like that to scare them even if it was a fear I had myself.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I understand that anxiety is very real and very difficult to handle. But I am not the appropriate person to talk to you about these fears and will not put up with it anymore. I am begging you to please seek professional help from a therapist. Unchecked anxiety is no joke and it can affect all your relationships, including ours. I really want to have a good relationship with you, but sometimes the unchecked anxiety makes it impossible.

Not looking for answers because tbh there aren't any. But I just feel so frustrated and so much despair and have no outlet for it. 

I will preface this by saying myself and my nuclear family have never been close. My parents were horribly abusive when i was young and my only sister is basically a mini-me of my mom. I moved out like a thief in the night 3 days after I turned 18 and never went back. For the last 9 years I have lived out of state and only visited once or twice a year, and when I do I stay with my grandma. My parents and sister have made efforts to varying degrees over the years to reconcile, but I've never received an apology and have struggled with that basically since I left. 

2015 rolls around and I become basically shocked that both my parents are trumpers. My sister is not and my grandma is not. Over the following years my relationship with my parents became even more strained. And now, this year, I find out through my grandma that they are full blown Q. Like, to the point my dad rants and raves to strangers in public about it. My mom and sister ""aren't as bad"" my grandma claims, but any level of trumpism or Q is bad enough. I'm almost grateful to have the excuse of a pandemic to have not visited since Christmas 2019 because I honestly don't even know how I could deal with them. My mom has been texting me more as of recently but I've figured out it is simply her trying to get me to join them in their bullshit beliefs. It is both infuriating and depressing as hell. 

My family is very small. It consists of my nuclear family and my grandma, at this point. I am not married and have no children (without a desire for either if im being honest with myself). When my grandma passes, most likely in the next few years, they will be the literal only family I have in the world. And because of that, I basically will be alone because even if they woke up tomorrow morning and were like, ""oops our bad, that shit was crazy and we were wrong"" I wouldn't even care. Fuck that! The vile and horrible shit they have said and done, combined with the utter stupidity they have displayed by falling for this bullshit, has made me lose any ounce of respect I ever had for them as well as any interest in reconciliation. But at the same time, I'm sad and honestly fucking scared of being without any family in this fucked up world. Like I said im basically just venting. It just all fucking sucks. Fuck trump, fuck Q, and fuck people choosing it over everything and everyone.

Right now, the only thing I’m interested in is holding them to fully account for the damage they have done to our country and the people in it. That’s it.

I'm just feeling a lot of things right now. Angry. Frustrated. Tired. I'm showing my sister my better side, but the bad side has to go somewhere. Let's keep this short: I have lived two-and-a-half hours away from my family for like seven or eight years. We never visit for birthdays, except  like a 21st birthday or something, but we all send cards and gifts. We visit for Thanksgiving and Xmas. Sometimes my fiancee and I visit the family for a weekend or so. Nobody visits us.

Last year when covid hit my sister immediately became an anti-masker. I was not aware of this at first. What I WAS aware of was that suddenly my sister started really pushing for everybody to ""go on a trip for her birthday"". This was two months after lockdown started. I said no, definitely not. My brother said no. My mom said yes but cancelled after we both said no. My sister was apparently super crushed and still wanted to have some kind of gathering. I felt bad for her because, at the time, I wasn't suspicious that this was all about covid denial. So I reluctantly agreed to make a day trip to see them, just my family, no outings otherwise, on her birthday. At the time my fiancee was working from home, and I was working but with a very limited number of people (see: two). I also had the ability to take appropriate days off to ensure I wasn't going to spread anything. I was checked for symptoms twice a day at work, and I wore a mask. There were only about 12 cases of recognized covid in town. I felt guilty, but went to her birthday because it was important to her and I was able to take a lot of precautions.

On her birthday I found out she was an antimasker. Because it was her birthday, I did not push the issue.

Then in September, she decides to throw my brother a ""surprise birthday party"". If there's anyone who has a more complicated relationship than her and me, it's her and him. She would never, EVER throw him a party. Also, she like...doesn't throw parties. Our mom does. My sister arranging the party was really weird. I declined. My brother would not have come, but my mom invited him over and...surprise! A bunch of people! To spread germs! Yay!

Thanksgiving came. I declined. My sister decided to travel to Palm Springs with her boyfriend and his family...on a plane...during covid. But before she left she made sure to text me and ask me my plans. I said no, I was not going, my dad is nearly 70 and my sister lives with him and if he died because of me I could never forgive myself. She said, ""Well, you never know, these family occasions are important because he may not make it to next year!"". Then she flew to Palm Springs and spent the holiday without our dad. My mom got pizza and ate it with my dad and my brother. I had store-bought chicken with my fiancee and we managed to have a nice time.

Xmas came. I made my second exception to see them that year. I was nervous, but I missed them so much.

My birthday came and went with well wishes, gifts, and no visitations. My mom got her vaccine and my sister stopped talking to her for two weeks.

Now, today, she tells me she's ""throwing a surprise birthday for mom""! And gee, wouldn't I love to take a day off work and have my fiancee take a day off work and drive two-and-a-half hours during a plague to come celebrate a birthday we have literally never had a party for before? Not to mention my workplace is no longer safe. I am exposed to dozens of people a day. People fucking take their masks off to talk to me all the time and I have to ask them to put it back on....while still in the store. I work with like six people plus the public. My risk factor is much higher. So I tell her no in the most polite way I can. ""I have a wedding coming up this year and I need to save my vacation days for the bridal party and honeymoon"". We will be having the wedding in her city, so I will need time off. This is a valid excuse, especially since I work for a small business, have worked there less than a year, and haven't really been there long enough to justify crippling the staff whenever I want for whatever reason.

Then she says, ""wait what about MY birthday?""

At this point I'm hearing the theme from the Omen playing somewhere in the background. I am damn sure by this point that the parties she's throwing are an excuse to flout social distancing, even if they're in the rules. (I mean, there's going to be like five or six people there.) Then she texts me that ""it just made her so happy to have me there last year and it would mean the world to her if I could come"". So I tell her sure, I'll make an exception for her birthday, but not mom's. My mom will understand. My sister will not. Then she pushes the issue. ""Where I worked you could just ask for days off in advance but I understand"". 

So I tell her as gently as I can, ""I work for a small business and I have been here less than a year. Also my fiancee will have to take time off to get me there. If I lived near you and there was no covid I would visit all of you every birthday"". Then she gets mad saying I should have just told her I was worried about covid. Then she tells me to ""stay safe from the boogeyman"".

I just can't anymore. She keeps asking me to take risks because she ""loves me so much"", but then lashes out when I tell her that I believe in protecting her even if it means I'm being tricked. I have never felt less loved. I have never felt so much like all of our interactions are just manipulation. I told my brother, she used to be just unpleasant, but now I can no longer talk to her without feeling like she's fucking lying or using me for something.

I think I have lost the ability to think of her as poor and misled. She's not respectful. She's not loving. She's malicious. Fuck Q, fuck covispiracy, fuck her.

TLDR: My sister who has never cared about family events (and clearly still doesn't after she skipped Thanksgiving to travel during covid) has been constantly throwing parties for family birthdays and I have to keep declining them. She has never arranged a party for anyone before. She insulted me for telling her no because of covid.

First time poster, and I’m really new to anything related to QAnon, so please bear with me and correct me as needed.

Background: my mom has always been Republican and conservative, and I used to be until I got out on my own and was able to form my own opinions. She and I have butt heads over politics and policies, but have remained pretty civil, until the coronavirus started making its way to America early-2020.

It started out as little comments here and there, about how it was “just a flu” and how “masks aren’t even that effective” to now she acts like someone is holding a gun to her head every time she has to put a mask on. She also gave me the longest side-eye look when I told her I’d gotten the first round of the vaccine. She’s not totally anti-vax, but she also hasn’t had a flu shot in ten years, so.

This weird “suddenly worsened” trope also went towards her religion. I consider myself more agnostic than anything, but over the last five years she’s just THROWN herself into The Lord. Which, y’know, whatever, but when I was first telling her about my now-ex-partner, her first question was “[are they] a Christian?” Not their name, where they’re from, what they do, no. Their religious beliefs. I gave her a non-answer, and she replied with, “as long as [they’re] not a Muslim” (with THAT pronunciation) and I was just flabbergasted. She also made the off-handed comment this past weekend that “maybe Princess Diana’s death was a ‘God-Thing’, because she was getting involved with that Muslim guy.”

But, honestly, emotional-dumping aside, what I really need advice on is this new bullshit she’s doing. Recently, Biden signed an Executive Order that went over climate change and his plans on helping to fix it/slow it down. Somewhere in that order was something about China. And I’m not being vague on purpose, because which EO and which part of it is where I get tripped up, BUT. To the best that I have been able to figure out, through a right-wing publication, China supposedly now has control of the US’s electric grid. And she is CONVINCED that the Chinese government is gonna give us a national blackout and brick all of our tech. She has this elaborate plan on coming to get me in her husband’s truck (which is older than most, so it doesn’t rely on a computer) and she’s been slowly stocking up on cans and dog food. She didn’t even go this far when we went through both Ike and Harvey.

I guess, my biggest concern is, how do I gently break it to her that she’s gone off the deep end? Or at least dipping her legs into it. I’ve tried before hinting to her that I’m tired of people blindly following articles without doing any proper vetting or research, but she only did so for a week. And please, if someone can figure out which EO she’s talking about, I will be grateful. It breaks my heart to see her like this, truly. I just want my rational mom back.

I know exactly how ""losing everything"" feels, because it happened to me.

That's WHY I care so passionately about the right to health care.

That's WHY I think food stamps and Section 8 are so important.

That's WHY I think unemployment needs to last longer and lose its stigma.

That's WHY I think bankruptcies should feel less punitive and oppose ""strategic bankruptcy.""

That's WHY I want people to know that Disability isn't easy to get, but difficult.

That's WHY I think the average wage needs to increase.

That's WHY I resent wealthy people and businesses that evade taxes.

That's WHY I believe the US is in need of a safety net comparable to that in other wealthy nations.

That's WHY I think Americans need to develop empathy for others, realizing that virtually anyone can be financially devastated by events they cannot control. 

And all these things are just some of the reasons WHY I oppose the GOP and Trump in particular.

Right now, the crown jewel of that side of the family is my 3-year-old niece who is an absolutely incredible kid--very bright and personable. During a recent visit, however, I learned that she has nightmares of being eaten by Joe Biden. Notably, she does not know who Joe Biden is, nor can she identify him. But *someone* has obviously been filling her head with this nonsense to the point that it has invaded her dreams and occupies her thoughts almost daily. I've brought this up to my BIL/SIL and pointed out that this is a super-not-normal thing for a 3-year-old to dream about or obsess over, but I just get the ol' shrug-a-roonie. Honestly, I don't expect that they're the ones talking about this bullshit with her--it's most likely her dipshit FIL who could teach a fucking masterclass in traumatizing children, and who WILL NOT EVER SHUT UP ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES. The man is Trump without the money or (thankfully) the sexual assault.

I don't know why I'm making this post, really, I just wanted to vent about it, I guess. In all likelihood, I'll be cutting off most contact with that side of the family indefinitely for reasons that go way beyond Q. My wife and I are about to have our first kid and there is no way in hell that I'm going to allow that influence to take root in his young mind.

  Over the last 4 years my wife’s parents have gone from amazing members of the community and people I looked up to to being Qanon faithfuls and scary. I don’t really know how to approach the situation. 

  My wife and I share mainly the same beliefs and are on the same political spectrum. The issue is we both deeply love her parents but they are becoming more and more of a worry for us and their influence on my kids. 

  Currently they watch my 3 year old in the afternoons and we are worried she will start taking what they talk about and learning around it. I know in my life my grandparents were way more influential than my parents. 

  I want to ask them to stop and be respectful of our views as we are with theirs but knowing my father in law that won’t take that well. They are very closed and are deep into some of the most outrageous things I’ve seen so reason and sense is probably too far gone. 

  Do I say something? As far as I know all of the kids feel the same about it but her parents are obviously key parts in all of our lives no one says anything and sometimes we all just agree.

I’m so glad to see this subreddit for support in such a real issue we are facing. I take comfort in the fact that I’m not alone in my struggle, though I’m saddened by how deeply this has impacted our nation that we should need this for solace. I post this not looking for advice, as I believe this is a personal matter and one, as I love him dearly, only I can address. I do hope that by saying things things I might gain mastery over my feelings and maybe even encourage someone else who reads this. 

I grew up in the south, was educated there, and left to gain new perspective.  I never really considered myself a part of any party but I certainly saw myself in the sways of their rhetorics at times. Mostly though, I just never saw enough from the lot to believe this system of government we have to be all that effective (likely a byproduct of capitalism but really not germane to the topic at hand). My father in all of this always taught me to vote for the person not the party and to keep on trying even if you don’t get the result you hopped. When we result to apathy the system no longer represents us. We always had splendid conversations about government and politics and he brought me up to put value in having a set of moral beliefs.  My father was at all times love and never put his needs before mine. 

Ever since my leaving, I’ve noticed a shift in him (and maybe one that has encompassed my long-time once home). A shift that is clearly not isolated and one that has brought me here, reading your testimonies. I, like so many of you, have discussed to the point of losing my temper to no avail and begetting only self defeat. My heart aches and I am tired. 

We have a child now, and this makes my burden all the harder as I want her growing up knowing the man that raised me in love.  I walk a narrow path and should I stray to one side I am lost in the anger and lies of those that find it much easier to escape their freedom by yielding it to those so willing to control them at what ever cost in fascistic splendor. To the other I face the forever separation of the one I hold dear.   I cannot quit my walk down this road though it’s easy to want to throw my hands up and cry out this was his doing not mine. Doing so has its own price to pay. If it were an abusive situation it would be all the easier, but the reality is my father is lost and I’d want my all to see him safely home. I’ve weighed and measured my codependency in the matter. I’ve certainly talked it over times untold with my spouse and cherished friends. What’s left is to walk on in this lonely night and keep hoping for the glimmer of a rising sun. 

In a time now where facts carry no more weight, I can only reason love as my only reaming tool.  

Thank you for letting me get this off my chest, and thank you for this group where we can share. I’m sorry I cannot provide any advice to others as much as I cannot say my choice is the right one for anyone else here. Know I care about you all and that I hope we can find peace one day in our struggles.",True,False,False,QAnonCasualties,t5_1g87gi,127968,public,confidence,self,The tightrope we walk out of love,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/lguwtz/the_tightrope_we_walk_out_of_love/,some_ads,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
