0,A QAnon site to see,If any of you wish to understand just how crazy QAnon is let me suggest anonup.com. A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I honestly believe a lot of Christians have been deceived by this conspiracy, as well deceived by Trump, but I need to verify this for sure. I can't just go by what I believe. I need facts. Would there be anyone who would be willing to speak with me?

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

16,Found out what Qanon was... and that a close family member was super into it,"So for awhile I had no idea qanon was a thing, until some friends were making fun of qanon believers and I asked what it was. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory that all democrats are pedophiles and Trump is trying to stop them‚Äù they said. I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I honestly believe a lot of Christians have been deceived by this conspiracy, as well deceived by Trump, but I need to verify this for sure. I can't just go by what I believe. I need facts. Would there be anyone who would be willing to speak with me?

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

16,Found out what Qanon was... and that a close family member was super into it,"So for awhile I had no idea qanon was a thing, until some friends were making fun of qanon believers and I asked what it was. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory that all democrats are pedophiles and Trump is trying to stop them‚Äù they said. I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I honestly believe a lot of Christians have been deceived by this conspiracy, as well deceived by Trump, but I need to verify this for sure. I can't just go by what I believe. I need facts. Would there be anyone who would be willing to speak with me?

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

16,Found out what Qanon was... and that a close family member was super into it,"So for awhile I had no idea qanon was a thing, until some friends were making fun of qanon believers and I asked what it was. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory that all democrats are pedophiles and Trump is trying to stop them‚Äù they said. I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I honestly believe a lot of Christians have been deceived by this conspiracy, as well deceived by Trump, but I need to verify this for sure. I can't just go by what I believe. I need facts. Would there be anyone who would be willing to speak with me?

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

16,Found out what Qanon was... and that a close family member was super into it,"So for awhile I had no idea qanon was a thing, until some friends were making fun of qanon believers and I asked what it was. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory that all democrats are pedophiles and Trump is trying to stop them‚Äù they said. I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I honestly believe a lot of Christians have been deceived by this conspiracy, as well deceived by Trump, but I need to verify this for sure. I can't just go by what I believe. I need facts. Would there be anyone who would be willing to speak with me?

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

16,Found out what Qanon was... and that a close family member was super into it,"So for awhile I had no idea qanon was a thing, until some friends were making fun of qanon believers and I asked what it was. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory that all democrats are pedophiles and Trump is trying to stop them‚Äù they said. I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I honestly believe a lot of Christians have been deceived by this conspiracy, as well deceived by Trump, but I need to verify this for sure. I can't just go by what I believe. I need facts. Would there be anyone who would be willing to speak with me?

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

16,Found out what Qanon was... and that a close family member was super into it,"So for awhile I had no idea qanon was a thing, until some friends were making fun of qanon believers and I asked what it was. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory that all democrats are pedophiles and Trump is trying to stop them‚Äù they said. I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I honestly believe a lot of Christians have been deceived by this conspiracy, as well deceived by Trump, but I need to verify this for sure. I can't just go by what I believe. I need facts. Would there be anyone who would be willing to speak with me?

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

16,Found out what Qanon was... and that a close family member was super into it,"So for awhile I had no idea qanon was a thing, until some friends were making fun of qanon believers and I asked what it was. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory that all democrats are pedophiles and Trump is trying to stop them‚Äù they said. I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I honestly believe a lot of Christians have been deceived by this conspiracy, as well deceived by Trump, but I need to verify this for sure. I can't just go by what I believe. I need facts. Would there be anyone who would be willing to speak with me?

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

16,Found out what Qanon was... and that a close family member was super into it,"So for awhile I had no idea qanon was a thing, until some friends were making fun of qanon believers and I asked what it was. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory that all democrats are pedophiles and Trump is trying to stop them‚Äù they said. I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.

A good 10 minutes will give you an idea of the rabbit hole your loved ones have been sucked into. This is just one of hundreds if not thousands of Q sites on the internet. Another is the new social app CloutHub. Covid and lockdown have unfortunately added to people joining QAnon as people spend more time online. QAnon is a worldwide movement of Covid deniers and anti-vaxxer movement and conspiracists.,QAnonCasualties
1,Mom being even more brainwashed than I thought,"I just discovered from an acquaintance that my mom is directly being brainwashed by a person...not just a group or internet following.  I was told that my mom spends a lot of time on the phone with this person for guidance and questions. This person advises her what to research, directs her actions (i.e. cut out family) and I think is  controlling her emotions. Anyone come across this with their Q loved ones? The  acquaintance says it's very strange interactions over the phone but doesn't know who is on the other line. Anyone have experience with this?  I don't really have any family to help rally around this and embrace that there are even bigger  problems here. They don't want to deal but I know I cannot intervene on my own.",QAnonCasualties
2,My mom is being fed conspiracies by my her brother,"Over the past couple months, my mom has been in a group chat with her sister and brother. Her brother has always been a conspiracy theorist. He also worked for the govt but couldn't tell us what he did and then when he got married he moved to the other side of the country without stating a clear reason.

I think my mom takes his experience so closely involved in the govt and the fact that he is a relatively educated man as reason to believe what he tells/ sends her, but I have never seen it affect her like it has recently. 

She works in a medical setting and even though she abides by all the rules, she doesn't believe in getting the vaccine for at least a year until it's come out. I caught her on some guy's website about the deep state the other day and asked her what he was talking about. She said it's this guy that knows what's going on behind the scenes. She said something about the ""fraudulent election"" and its ties to Italy? She has floated Sidney Powell's conspiracies long after she was fired. Today my sister said that my mom bought a generator so we will be prepared if the democrats start a civil war. I am a democrat. The civil war theory has been one my Uncle as toted for as long as I can remember.

She has never been interested in politics, so she has no frame of reference. She doesn't trust the government and she doesn't trust mainstream media. 

I've sent her so many sources counteracting her and my uncle's claims. I've sent her recourses to use when reading online to recognize credible information. I've collected all the emails that my Uncle had sent her (and his wife, my Grandpa, my grandma, my other aunt, her husband, my cousin and my second cousin) after I blocked his email address (he sends things from ZeroHedge, The Epoch Times, sovereign Man, humansarefree etc) but I am in my last semester in my data analytics degree and very busy so I have not been able to compile the information and debunking notes into a final email to him. I also worry that it may cause him to send more theories to my family and that my work will be for nothing, as I know how difficult it is to convince someone who knows not the difference between credibility and hearsay.

Do any of you have any master lists of conspiracy websites to avoid with sources as to why they are dangerous/ not credible?

Should I reach out to my Uncle and ask him to stop sending these things to my mom, try to show him evidence that directly contradicts his claims, or not reach out to him at all?

This has really been taking a toll on me. I had my first panic attack in a year over it and it's getting harder for me to focus on my schooling. My mom has obviously been worrying way more too. I don't know what to do anymore. I worry when I move out it will just get worse",QAnonCasualties

I honestly believe a lot of Christians have been deceived by this conspiracy, as well deceived by Trump, but I need to verify this for sure. I can't just go by what I believe. I need facts. Would there be anyone who would be willing to speak with me?

This is a genuine question. I don‚Äôt know enough about the internet and tracking. But it seems like anyone (especially tech people on Reddit) can uncover anyone. So... why not those behind Q? I want so badly for exposure to illuminate what our loved ones have been believing.",QAnonCasualties
8,Reformed Followers Please Help,"If there are any reformed followers of Qanon, I'm asking for your help please.  I am almost 100% certain that several family members have been brainwashed into believing this nonsense, and I need to flat out ask them.   Even though all evidence thus far has confirmed my suspicions, I  know how it works with these specific family members and I just need specifics to point out to them, which is where you come in.  

Where did you go to get these so called ""crumbs"" of information?  If you aren't comfortable posting it as a comment, please send it as a message if that's possible.  Like I stated, I need to hit them with all of my concrete proof, not just my hunches, at once when I confront them.  

I'm only going to do this once, it's one and done.  I'm not going to give them any time to think of excuses or back peddal.  Once my suspicions are confirmed, I'm cutting them out of my life.

11,"I've lost the only person who was there most of my life, I'm literally worried for their life, and I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help? I'm desperate for ideas/suggestions.","Hello there! I only recently found this sub, and figured I'd post. It seems like many of the stories I've read here involve people's loved ones being sucked into the conspiracy theories online, but my Q-person doesn't use the internet, and I'm honestly not even sure how much they know about Q-Anon specifically, but a lot of their ideas and conspiracies fall in line with what they preach. I'm sorry about the length, I tried to make it as short as possible while providing enough information to paint the picture. I understand if it's too much, but if you do make it through thank you so much!

My dad was pretty much the only person that was there for me most of my life, the only person I really had that was supportive, encouraging, had my back, told me he was proud of me, etc. My mom was a narcissistic, abusive alcoholic. It's so bad right now I'd rather talk to my mother than my dad right now. Like, I used to love talking to my dad, now I dread it. 

The problem, I think, is made worse because to my understanding, he's doing drugs again (meth), and seems to sometimes enter states of psychosis/paranoia/etc... but his delve into all the conspiracies that somehow Trump was almost the messiah and only person to save us from the ""evil radical left"" and their socialist agenda, to drain the swamp, and somehow the only person actually looking out for us ""average folk"" started before his suspected drug use got bad. 

He's very anti-technology, as he's had episodes of psychosis involving some random guy we'll call Bob, who allegedly hacked my dad's Wi-Fi because Bob thought my dad was hitting on Bob's wife, and somehow Bob took over just my dad's internet (didn't affect my step mom's at all), and Bob was taunting my dad online, found out where my dad lived, stalked the house, etc. The delusions were real enough my dad broke his cell phone, broke a tablet, and gets angry my step mom won't call the internet company about it, she tells my dad to call them but he refuses. She also isn't allowed to use the Bluetooth in the car because apparently Bob has hacked into that too. Even though my step mom also is sucked into the whole Trump related conspiracies, even she understands everything my dad is saying this Bob character does isn't reality at all, and that this Bob person more likely than not doesn't even actually exist. So because of this, my dad is even more anti-technology, and instead gets all his news from Newsmax (because apparently Fox was taken over by antifa and the democrats), and whatever conspiracies my step mom has seen shared on Facebook about their dear leader, savior and overlord Trumpy.

I shudder to think of how much worse it could be if he did participate in the internet. But he most certainly believes Kavanaugh was railroaded by the ""evil dems"" and treated so unfairly, thinks Antifa is a terror organization hell bent on taking over the US and has operatives planted everywhere in the democratic party, and even some republican ""traitors"" (like the ones in GA who refused to bend to Trump's will and instead held up the voice of the voters). Him and my step mom think Covid is something blown out of proportion, and it seems to vary as to whether or not George Soros, Bill Gates, the Clintons, Obamas, and Elon Musk either developed it in cohorts with the Chinese for massive profit, either for control of the world or to massively profit off the vaccines (which also apparently will be microchipped so we can be tracked and be listened to 24/7), and also somehow the virus itself is a hoax in a sense and just a flu and nothing to be worried about, and that masks are just some way to try to control us and take away our freedoms, but also aren't a big deal (he'll wear one if a store he wants something from requires it but other than that refuses). He thinks the democrats will make this country totally socialist and communist, that they'll open the borders and flood us with ""illegals"" who are apparently all criminals, rapists, murderers, etc., and that the illegals and antifa will flood and take over all the suburbs, etc., and the dems will destroy the country (despite the fact none of this has ever happened under democrat control).

I know he thinks the election was stolen and rigged, even though it makes zero sense that the democrats and Biden would rig the presidential election from Biden's basement, but not ensure control of the Senate and lose seats in the House, but I haven't talked to him since Christmas, so I don't know what he feels or thinks about the attacks on the 6th of January. Going by what I see my step mom and others have posted on Facebook, it's entirely possible he also believes that the 6th was somehow staged by antifa to hurt Trump, that it was antifa that stormed the capitol and not a bunch of Q-Anon/white supremecists/etc. I miss my dad, who he was, I don't know this person he is anymore. I can try to talk to him about how adorable otters are, and it somehow turns into a volatile conversation about how the evil democrats hate this country and want to destroy it and Trump, the only person trying to save us and has the backs of us little poor people. And he gets *soooooooo* angry. Even when he's not on drugs the level of anger he has on nearly a constant basis is extremely concerning and scary. Even if I am just ""smiling and nodding"" and acknowledging what he's saying, all he does is scream and yell, and if I point out that I don't appreciate the fact he's yelling at me for absolutely no reason, he'll blame it on the fact other people make him angry.

It doesn't matter if I try to give him actual, reliable, factual information to dispute the conspiracy theories, try to present him with logic, ask him questions in a civil manner just trying to understand why he thinks or believes some of the things he sees/hears on Newsmax or his wife sees on Facebook, it doesn't matter if I just smile and nod and don't confront him but just be quiet and let him talk it out and not argue with him at all. Nothing I've said or done calms him down, keeps him from delving into these conspiracies, helps bring him into reality, anything. It never stops, it's neverending. ***ONE TIME*** I managed to get him to stay away from politics, during a more lucid moment, but he still couldn't help himself from making some comment ""*and this right here is why we need Trump*"", when I wasn't even making a political comment at all (I think it was about medical issues I was having). 

I'm not sure how many of you may have had experiences like this with people who refuse to interact with the internet at all personally, but if any of you have any ideas, suggestions, or anything, even if it's not exactly what I'd like to hear, I'd really appreciate any honest answers or advice you can give. I've tried everything I can think of, and most of the posts I've seen along the lines of *""Hey, try this on your Q-person!""* are more centered around people who actually use the internet, at least that I've seen.

I have a big birthday milestone coming up relatively soon, and if I don't talk to my dad before then, I know I will by then, and I hate the fact I dread it. I just miss my dad and want my dad back, but it feels really hopeless right now. I really don't know what else to do or where to go. He broke down once before and actually sounded like he was trying not to cry once and told me I'm the only family he has, and I'm scared of what would happen if I cut off contact with him (as he's actually tried committing suicide twice, although I only remember the one occasion when I was in elementary school). He's told me he's basically just sitting around waiting to die, so I'm extremely concerned for his well being even on those terms, and I don't want to do anything that would push him to do anything like that. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and have no where to move or go.

13,My grandpa a Qanon supporter,"So my grandpa is a Q supporter. He dosen‚Äôt believe COVID is real. He also doesn‚Äôt think 9/11 happened. His reasoning for that is fricking crazy. The plane that hit the first tower never crashed, it went around the building causing and optical illusion. And the pentagon was never hit by a plane. What‚Äôs crazy is that we visited the 9/11 memorial the Christmas of 2019. With the COVID he thinks it‚Äôs a hoax because know one he knows got it. And wearying your face thong (face mask I like to call it that cause it kinda looks like a thong) doesn‚Äôt help at all. He believes that the capital riot was Antifa and not actual trumpers. Also my family has a Mexican heritage so I‚Äôm part Latino. Well my grandpa wants all Mexican out of the country. But his Mom was a Mexican Immigrant though. Which is weird. He also believes that Parkland never happened which is crazy. I‚Äôm a 14 yr old kid and I was only 12 when that happened and I was freaked out by it( I was living in Florida). My mom doesn‚Äôt even talk to him anymore. Which is sad in my opinion. My Grandpa spends his time watching Oann or any other Far right group. Any advice to help change his view on Q.

14,A Brief Discussion On Sanity,"I'm a bit unsure if this post meets the intent and letter of the rules so I completely understand if this gets taken down. My intent is to provide a very tiny sanity life-line especially to those who have to listen to conspiracy ravings 24-7. I also preface this by saying I am lucky enough to not know any Q people directly (though there are a couple of maybe-canidates). 

I've seen people on this sub post several ""both-sides"" statements recently and I find it concerning and potentially harmful to those who are forcibly surrounded by non-reality on a regular basis. I think it's safe to say that most of us grew up learning ""there are two sides to every story"" and it is a natural reaction to the extreme political polarization we're seeing to try to find middle ground. To say that both sides have their truth and deserve equal consideration. 

However, this idea is based on a lie: that there are TWO sides. Having two sides implies two EQUAL sides, even if it is not directly stated. Side A says A but Side B says B. We unfortunately see this too often in daily life. One side says global warming is real and the other side does not and they are presented as ""potato, potahto"". 

This is also the perfect set-up for conspiracy theorists to lure people in. You were taught A all your life but it is actually B! What I propose isnt so powerful is when the true volume of ""sides"" is spoken to. You've been taught A all your life but some people think it could be B or C or D or E or F or....  It makes it easier to look at those other sides for what they are. Fringe ideas that dont make much sense. 

My point with this write-up is to remind everyone that there arent two sides, not even quite Qannon vs not-Qannon. It's closer to Reality vs. Qannon and flat-earth and hollow-earth and COVID hoax and 9/11 truthers and satanic panic and... well, every bizarre unsubstantiated idea anyone has ever come up with over the past several thousand years. If you at all feel pulled in by the Qannon ravings, keep in mind there's no good reason to value Qannon over any other idea you've already easily rejected. Germ theory is real, evolution is real, gravity is real. There is sanity and reality, as much as those around us and even our own psychology can make it difficult to always clearly see. 

I'd really like to hear from people on this ""two sides"" (any sides you define) idea and how you might have or have not seen it play out with the conspiracy-inclined. There is a political discussion to be had on this too but I'd prefer to keep that off of this sub and focus on Qannon.",QAnonCasualties

16,Found out what Qanon was... and that a close family member was super into it,"So for awhile I had no idea qanon was a thing, until some friends were making fun of qanon believers and I asked what it was. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory that all democrats are pedophiles and Trump is trying to stop them‚Äù they said. I then came to the realization that these are the conspiracy theories my brother had been telling me about since I was a kid. I then stumbled upon this subreddit. Pretty much everything I‚Äôve read aligns with my brothers beliefs. I had no idea this was a conspiracy theory with tons of followers, I thought it was just something my brother had come up with because he did ‚Äúhours of research‚Äù. I also didn‚Äôt know it was basically a cult. His ramblings actually scared me away from politics because I thought I had to do hours of research to actually know what I was talking about. I almost didn‚Äôt vote. But due to the state of the world I did some basic research and voted accordingly.

20,Ideas for cheering up my boyfriend who‚Äôs having a hard time with his extremely right-wing (Q sympathizing) parents.,"So, both my (33F) boyfriend (34M) and I come from very conservative homes. But our families navigate those differences very differently. Mine pretty well just prefers to avoid any potential topics that could cause conflict, and just focus on the fact that we love each other (there are hiccups in that plan from time to time‚Äîusually because I don‚Äôt play their game very well‚Äî but that‚Äôs the general approach). 

His family is much more aggressive. They fairly regularly have big blow ups with one another over differences in ideology. They also don‚Äôt know the meaning of boundaries and seem incapable of taking responsibility for themselves, ever. His sister is a right wing nut job and I‚Äôve seen her post Q stuff online which makes me sick. My partner and I are both liberal leaning, so we try to just navigate our families with care. We set boundaries and hold them, but regularly communicate our love for them. 

This weekend my boyfriend went to stay with his parents in a ski cabin to ski and watch the Super Bowl with his dad. We haven‚Äôt seen much of our families due to COVID (and his live a state away), but have made calculated exceptions. 

While he was there he and his dad got into an argument about COVID. He let it go and wanted to move on, but his dad insisted on continuing to act like a petulant child the rest of the trip. Then his mom told him today that his dad is just so upset about where the country is going and that he feels like people like his son (my partner) who think like they do are ruining the country. This infuriated me because HOW DARE SHE put that on him! But... I digress. 

The point is, he comes back to town today, and he‚Äôs just so heavy-hearted. It‚Äôs honestly wild because my partner is far more moderate than anything else, definitely more than me. And he‚Äôs very reasonable, really seeks to understand other‚Äôs perspectives, and is extremely gracious toward those who think differently than him (I, on the other hand, very much struggle to harness such graciousness). 

I want to do something special for him to comfort him, but I don‚Äôt know what? We‚Äôll be quarantining for the next week after his travels just in case, so we‚Äôre pretty limited. But I‚Äôd just love any creative ideas? Not sure if this is the right spot for this post, but figured I‚Äôd find folks sympathetic to his situation here.

21,My red pilled mom,My mom I don't think she believes in qannon yet. I am saying yet because her red pilling is getting worse.  My mom voted for Obama in 2012 and then Trump in 2016. I first suspected something wrong when she wanted to go to a trump rally. I remember when she wanted to go and I was like why do you want to go to a Trump rally. I saw them for what they were nuremberg rallies. When Charlotesvile  happened she started to say there were good people on both sides.  She even sent me the praugerU video about it. Then in 2018- 2019 my mom started talking about spygate. She started sending me stuff on john durham and that he is going to get muller and obama.In 2016 I got married to a chinese woman. My mom will constantly annoy my wife about how terrible China is. My wife knows how terrible the government is but my mom is constantly on her case whenever they talk. After the capital riots my mom deleted her Facebook. I was extremely happy and thought she was making progress. My mom with holds things from me in order to force me to talk to her. I went up to talk to her about my birthday present yesterday. I told her I noticed you deleted your Facebook and asked if she is no longer a trump supporter and what she said made my jaw drop. She said that she is like Bernie but on the right side. She said that she was a nationalist and she is a champion of freedom of speech and said she feels there is no longer a freedom of speech and that tech companies are censoring us. I told her you are free to speak but there are consequences for what you say. She then said we are living in china. I can't deal with this I am still processing this and thank you for reading.

22,Galileo gambit aka why they DoUbLe DoWn,"The Galileo gambit (also Galileo fallacy) is a logical fallacy that asserts that if your ideas provoke the establishment to vilify or threaten you, you must be right - ""everyone says I am wrong, therefore I am right.""

Users of the fallacy are to be understood as being essentially ""Galileo wannabes"".

The fallacy refers to Galileo Galilei's famous persecution at the hands of the Roman Catholic Church for his defence of heliocentrism in the face of the orthodox Biblical literalism of the day (though some alternative medicine proponents use Ignaz Semmelweis instead of Galileo). People use this argument repeatedly in response to serious criticisms that more often than not they just don't understand.

The fallacy is an appeal to the minority, an appeal to authority, and a conditional fallacy.

24,"When I hoped 2020 would radicalize my mom, this isn‚Äôt what I meant.","My mom has been steadily leaning farther and farther right since about late June or July, but in the past  month it‚Äôs become obvious how she‚Äôs gone off the deep end. Last night, just as I was finally falling asleep, I got woken up by my mom very loudly telling my 83-year-old grandma that the Capitol riots were staged (or a drill, basically), that one woman who got shot in the neck was wearing a belt that was designed to make her bleed, and that my mom doesn‚Äôt plan on getting the covid vaccine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmade of aborted baby cells‚Äù and ‚Äú99% percent of people aren‚Äôt affected by covid anyway‚Äù. My grandma‚Äôs room is right across from my room, so this isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard discussions similar to this, but this one rocked me to my core. Some things to note:

-My parents are the only conservatives in my family, my grandma has been watching CNN and MSNBC at least since I was 5 years old. She now has dementia and aphasia after surviving 3 strokes, and having a sort of routine in her life is important, though my mom insists that THIS routine of having CNN on her TV all the time is just ‚Äúletting lies into our house‚Äù. At some point, it just gets kinda sad to see my mom insist on these theories to an elderly relative like this.

-Most of my immediate family and I, my mom included, are high-risk (asthma, small lungs in my case, and age in my grandma‚Äôs case). We‚Äôve been staying home since March and having my dad run errands since he‚Äôs generally healthy. I‚Äôm convinced this is the one thing keeping her from becoming a full anti-masker and partygoer. She had a doctor‚Äôs appointment last month, I was in the same room making sure my brother didn‚Äôt get into things. She ACTUALLY was receptive when her doctor recommended the covid vaccine, and he explained how he recommends it to every patient he sees. She was afraid of people dying from it, and he told her the anaphylaxis cases are extremely rare and she has nothing to worry about in that aspect. I was pretty hopeful for a hot second and then last night happened.

-I had been warning her for months and months about QAnon being a cult, and to stay far away from them. Being in a Christian household, cults are generally pretty frowned upon, so I thought she‚Äôd listen. Now when my mom and I pray together each night, she‚Äôs started praying for kids to be rescued from traffickers, and for the wall (yes, THAT wall) to be built to keep traffickers out. Racism aside, it hurts to not be able to know whether this is a cause that‚Äôs sincerely on her heart or if this is Q-motivated. The fact that human trafficking is such a central thing in the QAnon world just infuriates me, because it‚Äôs a real problem, but now because of these guys, I have a feeling that ACTUAL cases of trafficking are either gonna be taken less seriously by the rest of the world, or serve as QAnon fodder. Or both. My mom also believes that there was a record number of trafficker arrests under the Trump administration.

-My little brother is adopted, Black, and autistic. The thing that scares me most about my mom‚Äôs belief system is that as he grows up, she‚Äôs gonna pass this on to him, too. I‚Äôm scared of him developing internalized racism because she‚Äôs so anti-BLM and he may not know better. My mom went from wanting to go to a protest in June after listening to our Haitian next-door neighbors‚Äô perspective on George Floyd‚Äôs death, to yelling at me that to align with BLM is to align with Satan himself, within 2 months. She believes the cops who killed Breonna Taylor were just doing their jobs and did nothing wrong, and called Jacob Blake an idiot more than once. I was already terrified enough of the possibility of police brutality against my brother, but I‚Äôm even more terrified that my mom might try to justify it.

I‚Äôm sorry this post was really long, I was awake til 6 AM this morning because my mind‚Äôs just been reeling. How do you guys navigate this space between mourning, frustration, and anger, and is it possible for me to turn all these feelings into something constructive?

25,Patricia Corey is the spawn of Satan,"Some other children of QAnon parents may know of Patricia Corey. She‚Äôs written some books on spirituality (because of course she has), and she has a few thousand YouTube subscribers who refer to her as ‚Äúmumma bear‚Äù. 

Anyways my mother has been a follower of her for years, starting with just the spiritual stuff. We‚Äôre British (she‚Äôs American), and my mum has met her a few times, as she‚Äôs organised meet-ups when she‚Äôs visited the UK. 

A few weeks ago I caught a glimpse of my mum watching one of her videos, and I realised this had gone further beyond the harmless spirituality stuff I thought it was. According to Patricia:
- Trump has time travel powers (she calls it ‚Äúthe looking glass technology‚Äù)
- The liberals all have a huge paedophillia ring, and they‚Äôre all nazis
- Obama is going to be arrested any day now for spying or what not 
- The election was rigged

^ apparently trump is going to expose all of this and save humanity. 

What‚Äôs worse is the people in her comment section. One lady talking about how she went to a rally without a mask and felt ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, another saying ‚Äútrump is god‚Äù (she ‚Äòlikes‚Äô all of these comments). I‚Äôll save the rest for your own entertainment if you wish to look her up. 

My mum is easily manipulated, and she‚Äôs just feeding into all of this. I‚Äôve had many problems with my mother but I feel like this is beyond worth repairing our relationship. 

My mum is also strongly anti-vax, believes every terrorist attack was set up by the government, and even anti covid testing (apparently there‚Äôs nano bits in the swabs which mess with your dna), not to mention believes covid is all a big scheme.

26,Trying to wrap my mind around conspiracy theories.,"I recently got back in touch with my eldest brother having been away for 3 years studying at University and to my total dismay he has been completely consumed by this Q movement and I am bombarded with the usual topics of Child Pedophile rings and Trump being the second coming of Christ.

Now I've had to put some distance between us until hopefully he can see the light for himself as no amount of logic or rationality seems to penetrate these theories and in many cases any evidence to their claims can simply be folded into the conspiracy and the layers of absurdity just continue to increase with apparently no boundary in sight.

However, I'm not here to seek sympathy or advice for my situation. I am actually curious how reasonable people who before falling into this ""rabbit hole"" often lived normal lives and for most part were reasonable and rational people.

How is it that upon stumbling across this information about widespread child sexual abuse and secret cabals that suddenly causes people to lose touch with reality?

 It's almost like Q is a carefully constructed mind virus that certain people are susceptible to and once it latches into their thought process it becomes firmly rooted and drastically reduces their tether to reality.",QAnonCasualties
27,I think I lost a friend....,"Sorry if this is a bit rambled I'm still trying to figure it out. Also not sure if this belongs here if not sorry in advance.
A few months ago a long time friend of mine (basically my only friend) let one of his clients (my friend is an auto mechanic) move in with him. The guy called him from jail since he'd been kicked out of where he was living and had no where to go. The place he was living and working had him arrested and a restraining order. My friend seeing an opportunity of help at his place went and got him out and got his stuff for him. (Note this guy has been kick out of his 3 previous places)
This guy always was, well let's say on the weird side. I have no problem with weird. A few months ago he invited himself on our camping trip. No worries. But he started saying all this far out shit. The Queen of England is a man. Obama is a clone. All clouds are chemtrails. Ooookkkkkk.  When id go over there im pretty vocal about hating Trump and said something and he said he'd take a bullet for him. When I gave the what look he acted like he was joking but I know he wasn't.
My friend is gullible and sometimes I think he's abit on the slow side of intelligence. Before this guy moved in I'd spend alot of time telling him no lizards from outerspace aren't running the government and trying to reprogram him. I seemed to keep him in reality but now he's living with this nut I think he's gone. Maybe for good.
Two weeks ago I get the dumbest strangest phone call. I pick up and my friend is ranting about someone shotting at him and coming in his house. I know it's not real. I live a mile away in a rural area and would have the shots and or the cop sirens. I finally get him calmed down and talking normal. He keeps talking to the new roomie while on the phone with me. Which I find so rude. Then he asked if I can help the guy with a computer problem. Sure. He gets on the phone and wants to copy a website to a PDF then into a word document to ""edit"" and then print. Well first why but whatever. So I'm brainstorming on the phone on how he can do it. Then I recommend that I can look at his computer to see what options he has. I could hear in his voice tension and underlining anger. He does NOT want anyone to look at his system. And he doesn't have some programs because government blablabla. It upsets me. I live alone. If this nut decides to fuck the world I could be in danger. He hands the phone back and my friend doesn't seemed fazed. Like not giving 2 fucks. I decided to not call or go over there anymore or at least til the nut is gone. Mind you I haven't gotten a call since so???

She seemed willing to entertain the idea that the claim could be false and asked me to look into it. I sent her 10+ medically backed sources and she said ‚ÄúOK.  I don‚Äôt trust most of these: CDC, Google, CBS or any of the Universities.  Hopkins might be okay.  I‚Äôll also reach out to (biologist friend)‚Äù

I‚Äôm honestly about to lose my mind. What can I even do at this point? She runs a company and was looking into getting her 50+ employees vaccinated but since her friend (a 50+ man, I might add) sent this BS article (which she won‚Äôt let me see) she‚Äôs suddenly decided that the vaccine is bad news. She got vaccinated a week ago and is now (despite being menopausal) that she doesn‚Äôt want the second dose.

Is there anything to be done? Or should I just give up? This whole thing started with the Trump election and ever since Sidney Powell went off the reservation, my mom has followed her right along.

I just go to my boyfriend's house on the weekend and it was fairly calm. Just minor comments made. She thinks Biden‚Äôs a clone and he was going to get arrested during the super bowl. She believed that at some point during the game, only on the channel the super bowl was on, it was going to be cut to an emergency broadcast of Biden getting arrested. This is all my boyfriend told me. He doesn't believe any of this just basic conservative beliefs so he thinks his mom is crazy and told her to shut up when she said Biden has been cloned. His mom didn't even watch the full game, only the first part. We went up to his room because we're not into sports so I'm not sure how she reacted when nothing happened.

35,My dad is destroying himself,"My dad is a lifelong republican. In 2016 he hated Donald Trump, and chose to vote for Gary Johnson, as he could not bring himelf to vote for Hillary. When the circus around Brett Kavanuagh's supreme court nomination came around, my dad thought the media and democrats in general were way to harsh on a man who's potential crimes could not be proven. From that moment on he became Donald Trump's biggest fan. My dad, who is in his 50s got an iPad for Christmas a year ago from my mom, and ever since he hasn't been the same. He started believing in all these wacky conspiracies. Covid really scared him at first, at first he was a prepper, 2 months later he thought it was just a flu. My dad every since last year has done nothing but watch right wing YouTube ""experts"" on the family room TV and browse his iPad. He does nothing else outside of work, and he works from home. He doesn't talk to anyone except about conspiracies, which no one else in the house is buying. He spams everyone in our house with SMS messages and emails, my brother and mother have threatened to block and have blocked him numerous times. 

He sometimes thinks Bill Gates wants to push a vaccine that's real purpose is to wipe the ""god gene"" and make people lose their connection to god/religion. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine slows down or stops reproduction. He sometimes thinks the COVID vaccine is like AIDS, where it will weaken the immune system so another virus can kill you on purpose. He fluctuates between 1 or 2 at a time. When my mom got her vaccine (she works at a few hospitals), my dad blew up, saying she willingly ""enslaved"" herself. 

Of course he bought the whole election fraud conspiracy. Hee thinks only a few Republicans and Donald Trump are standing up to save America from corrupt globalists like George Soros. He thinks George Soros funds and commands Antifa factions to riot and destroy America. He thinks Donald Trump actually has his interests in mind, and when pressed what Trump did for him,  he replied ""let me do some research and think about that."" Of course he never got back to me.

The scariest conspiracy he believes to me is that Michelle Obama is a transvestite, that Barack Obama is a homosexual, and that his kids are adopted and/or stolen at birth. That one scares me, because all of that is undeniably false. There are so many hoops and requirements a man has to jump through to become president, how can someone think that if all that were true it wouldn't come out at any point in his 8 years of presidency and months of campaigning?

Now he has an inheritance from my grandmother that he did not expect to get, and it is rather large. He is convinced the stock market is going to crash down and the U.S. Dollar is going to become worthless, like in Weimar Germany. He is spending 60% of it on an online silver website recommended by several right wing YouTubers. He hopes online communities like /r/WallStreetBets are going to short it and make it worth 5 times the amount he paid for slver, so he can sell it and buy land.

A dozen of my coworkers have tested positive. I tried to explain how vaccines are statistically safe and effective. 

She doesn‚Äôt deny the virus but her theories include shit about Bill Gates, the medical community, politics, global conspiracies (something about ‚Äúthe Zionists‚Äù), and some weird religious stuff too.

Her literal response: ‚ÄúYou are reciting me the propaganda. I know that you believe it. I am sorry that I can not make you see or search for the truth. Most people can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt. You trust the system. You trust pharmaceutical companies. You trust fauci. You trust the government.

38,What would you say to someone who is on the first step?,"Here is a story,with a few details changed. I hope it is appropriate for this community. I know that we aren't here to trash all conservative thinkers. But as many people can attest, a lot of people got sucked into weirder and weirder thought patterns.   


I was in a relationship with a woman from the Middle East who, for obvious reasons, disliked Donald Trump. But she also was a big fan of a certain conservative media personality/self-help person, who is generally not on the crazy side of things (but is a little vacuous), but from what I have read, seems to be the first step that lots of conspiracy theorists started with. She said I should watch his videos on YouTube and...we actually broke up over that. (I tried to watch one of his videos in incognito mode, it was tedious, and it was, of course prefaced by an advertisement on knife fighting, because the people who watch these type of things also think they are going to get into a knife fight at any moment). The thing was, we had actually talked about QAnon before, and when I told her there was a group of people who believed Hillary Clinton wore human faces, she was aghast (that they believed something so crazy).   


The problem is that while she hated all the crazy stuff, she didn't believe me about the context of the stuff she was watching and wanted me to watch. Because on the face of it, this man's opinions were not at all related to conspiracy theories. But after living in the US and dealing with the accelerating craziness for years, I just didn't want to hear about him. I am from Portland at times, so it made me mad ""There is like three steps between this guy and stabbing people on a train"". This is especially the case because QAnon and other such things are spreading outside of the US--- and many people might not get the context of how it relates to going on in the US.   


Has anyone else had this problem, where someone was dipping their toes in the water, even though they admitted the more crazy theories were crazy, but didn't believe it when they were told ""This stuff is uncomfortable for me, please just take my advice and steer away from it""? What do we do when the first step into believing in HAARP or lizard people is just watching a video advocating ""academic dialogue"" or ""freedom of speech""?",QAnonCasualties

* The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some important action that is difficult to undo. In general, the more important such actions are, and the more difficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment to the belief.
* The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that events may unequivocally refute the belief.
* Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual holding the belief.
* The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could withstand the kind of disconfirming evidence that has been specified.

41,Pregnant and had it up to here with the nonsense :/,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and am a first time mother. My husband and I are SO excited to welcome a new life into the world. Unfortunately, this period of our lives has been met with a lack of support from those we expected to be the most excited-- my parents. 

They are so wrapped up in the conspiracy theories that they fully believe there is NOTHING more to life than Q. It's gotten to the point where I can't even visit them or talk on the phone anymore, because I've asked respectfully to NOT talk about the COVID vaccine or pedophilia circles as there are ""other things we can discuss"". 

My mother has obliged this request, as I think she knows I won't have tolerance for this any longer. But my father, on the other hand, repeatedly refuses to honor that boundary, spamming me with texts about the COVID vaccine ""killing pregnant women"" or ""causing infertility"" and that I would be a bad mother if I took the vaccine, even though my OBGYN is currently recommending it for me due to my risk factors. 

He spams me with obviously fake content about the POPE being a child sex trafficker. He believes the Pope (from the Vatican) somehow stole the election in the USA and used COVID as a means to do so, all to protect his child sex ring. Like, c'mon dad. 

Normally, if people have different beliefs than mine, that's fine. I truly do not care. If you believe in ghosts, IDGAF. If you believe Michelle Obama is a man, truly, IDGAF. But this is more than a belief-- it's like he won't respect MY differing belief system and my boundaries as an individual. If this were a friend, I'd cut them out of my life. 

But he is the grandfather of my baby, and it's a lot less straightforward than that. Do I continue to reinforce boundaries and ask him not to text me about this shit? Or do I just start ignoring him? What's the most effective way? Setting boundaries verbally has not worked.

She thinks the Oxford vaccine changes your DNA even though Wiki says it's not a DNA or mRNA vaccine, but a traditional one. She says 9/11 was fake because in the videos of the planes hitting the towers, the nose of the plane came out of the building. Then she said the Holocaust testimony is all lies, and I told her ''okay, that's a little anti semetic..'' and also that ''I don't like to entertain these types of discussions to be honest''.

She calls me stupid because I am skeptical, I spent hours trying to find confirmation about if the Oxford COVID vaccine is an mRNA one, and I could not find anything, but she claims she saw a video posted by the BBC saying it.

She thinks 5G is genocide, and although I tried to explain to her that all 5G is, is light too weak for us to see, she kept going on telling me to ''do research''.

She also thinks Obama is gay, and that Michelle Obama is a transwoman, said in a tone to implicate those things being wrong or bad.

But she keeps going on about it, there's some things I agree with her on (like how lots of celebrities got busted for child trafficking and whatnot), but stuff like this makes me roll my eyes and it seems like she's becoming obsessed.

I'll be having the COVID Oxford or Sputnik vaccine since I have allergies, I'm part of the 'vulnerable' group due to asthma, anemia and a neurological disorder. I had flu before the only year I didn't have my shot, and I don't want something similar again.

44,Long time lurker here. Now Q has hit my family.,"Quick background - I spent 9 years in the military with USACAPOC, two combat tours, combat wounded, blahblah. I just threw this out there because I know the military very well. How it operates, how information is disseminated, how secret clearance works, chain of command, martial law, etc. Seeing how Q stuff revolves around alot of military fantasy is comical to me. It's so absurd.

Anyway, I've been following conspiracy theories since I was a kid. It's more of a hobby than anything. I just always knew they we're going have an huge effect in culture. That turned out to be more true than I would have expected. I've been following Qanon since it's inception. It's the dumbest conspiracy theory I've ever come across. I knew it was a joke/troll from day one because no Q clearance exists in the military. Not to mention, what it says just isn't real. Now I realize it was a psyop. More than a troll.

My mom is anti-vax and subject to alot of conservative religious indoctrination and fear-mongering. So I have made it a point to warn her to stay away from Q and conspiracy stuff she reads on Facebook for a while now. She was a covid-denier until her next door neighbor/my dads best friend died of it last summer. She still refuses to accept it's THAT big of a deal. Even though if my dad gets it, he's gone.

So a few days ago she messaged me; ""did you hear Trump is taking back power on march 4th. He's going to declare martial aw because he is still in charge of the military, and rescue all the kids from the underground tunnels"". I thought she was joking and laughed. Then she went on saying she doesnt know what to do, and how terrified she is. I then realized she wasn't joking. She was having an actual-panic attack about an impending civil war.

It turns out my aunt went full-blown Q over the last year. I knew she was hardcore Trump-supporter, and knew she was going down the Q path. But I didnt realize she was fully invested into it. So she's been feeding my mom and dad all this Trump/March 4th crap, and they IMEDIATELY BELIEVED IT. My mom said my aunt has a ""friend who has a son who is in the military"", and that son said his unit was gearing up to take to the streets for a Trump declared martial law. I was insulted that they'd rather believe this anonymous source over my own first-hand knowledge of how the military operates. This is insane to me, since Trump does not have any control over the military. Period.

I was trying to remain calm talking to my mom. Trying too tell her this is just a massive troll, a lie, a scam, and that eople's lives and relationships are getting destroyed over this stuff. I had a feeling it was going in one ear and out the other with her. It's almost like she WANTED to believe this stuff no matter what I said. She kept going back to my aunts friends son who's ""in the military"".

So my sisters messaged me yesterday, saying my mom is now telling them to watch out. That this stuff is going to happen and she worried about them. They tried talking sense into her, but she cant let it go.

I wouldn't say this has been a ""fear"" of mine, but I knew this day would probably come where my own family would get sucked into this toxic cancerous psyop.

Fortunately March 4th is only a month away, and when nothing happens MAYBE my mom will realize this is a scam. But my aunt isnt going to budge. She's going to move the goalpost again. Then comes trying to convince my parents to cut her out before she destroys the family. The seeds have already been planted. It's just a matter of playing damage control from here on out.",QAnonCasualties

46,Finally happened to me,"I‚Äôve been studying qanon for almost two years now, and I‚Äôm currently in college writing my thesis on it. I‚Äôve been keeping up with qanon religiously and know more about it than most qanon supporters probably do. I‚Äôve surrounded so much of my life with the academic and theoretical side of qanon, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs finally personal. My grandma and I have never been close‚Äîshe‚Äôs a conservative Catholic and I‚Äôm a leftist atheist, but we‚Äôre friends on Facebook so I see her posts and comments. They‚Äôve always toed the line on qanon but never fully made the leap. Anyway I wrote a guide to qanon that I had posted on this sub a few weeks ago, which was really well received both on Reddit and Facebook, and I heard about so many people sending it to their friends and loved ones, which is amazing. My goal is to help people understand qanon, so I‚Äôm so grateful I could do that. Unfortunately, when I shared the guide on Facebook, my grandma read it. She apparently told my uncle that she is 100% sure I wrote it about her. I definitely didn‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt know she was this far into qanon until just now. 

All of this to say, she‚Äôs refusing to get vaccinated and fully resents me. All of my experience with qanon has been academic, and now that it‚Äôs personal I feel sort of shocked and confused. I‚Äôve never been close to my grandma, but this is still so sad to see.",QAnonCasualties
47,Here is the latest email from my Qanon father: FW: Vaccine - why Mom and I won't take it,"I'm pretty annoyed at this today. I just talked to my brother and he feels the same. I don't know if this makes sense but Dr. Simone Gold is my nemesis. I've been following her since her first Frontline Doctor's video promoting hydroxychloroquine and she has led to a few arguments with family members down the rabbit hole. I'm a trained scientist-practitioner and I just want to tear this kind of ""scientific evidence"" apart with real science, but I won't. I'll keep my mouth shut. I have to avoid this guy to avoid pointless arguments about stupid things. Last week was Nancy Pelosi taking away pronouns and his ability to be called grandpa. My parents are in their 60s and far from birthing age. I think this has something to do with my sister-in-law's ability to have a second child. He's always trying to use the excuse, ""Think of your baby growing up in this world I'm trying to tell you about."" to try and sway my brother to his way of thinking.

&gt;Please take the time to listen too! This is scientific evidence that supports our decision not to take it. Also, it advises women who are of the birthing age to not take it due to potential complications thru the placenta. Love, father

48,My sister's slow progression to Q,"My older sister has been my best friend my whole life. We had almost everything in common, both of us were super progressive. That was till September 11. She became a republican, and I could understand why. Then when Obama became president she started down the conspiracy rabbit hole. It started with birthrism, then Benghazi conspiracies, then The Great Replacement. Then Trump came along. She believes everything that comes out of his mouth. No matter how much evidence to contrary you showed her. For the first time in our lives we argued. I would post something like, ""Why does my small town have two armored personnel carriers, but my kids teacher have to have fundraisers just for basic supplies"". I would get paragraphs and paragraphs of text messages, about how BLM and Antifa are going to kill us all and hunt down white people. She would tell me about how Trump literally was at ground zero after September 11th helping the rescuers. When I sent your multiple articles from trusted resources showing that he actually never helped out at all just said that he did, she would yell at me about fake news and how I am just a sheep. even when I made a rule that we weren't allowed to talk about politics Trump or anything, she couldn't help but bring it up every single time.

I've always been interested in conspiracy theories not because I believe in them, but more I was fascinated by the people that got involved in conspiracy theories especially the craziest ones. I knew about Q when I first started popping up. So I knew all about the conspiracy theories that they were touting. Now my sister is never actually specifically called out QAnon, but she would repeat their conspiracy theories. When Joe Biden was inaugurated, I saw a Twitter post from her account of fear, confusion, and lost. 

Sadly we haven't really spoken since around July of 2020. She just keeps on doubling down on the conspiracy theories. She thinks that I've been brainwashed, and then I don't know the truth. I'm afraid our relationship will never be the same. As she's gotten involved with these conspiracy theories, she's become more and more of a white nationalist..",QAnonCasualties

50,Looking for Arizonans to share their story,"  

Hello r/QAnonCasualties,

My name is Caylee and I am a digital video producer for 12 News in Phoenix, Arizona. I am looking to do a story on a person who lives in Arizona who has a family member or loved one who now follows QAnon beliefs. I am interested in connecting with someone whose parent, parents, or guardian have become a QAnon follower. However, I am interested in all stories, so if you live in Arizona and would like to talk to me regarding a ruined relationship because of QAnon, please reach out.

My goal with the story is to bring awareness to the serious ramifications that following QAnon can cause in people‚Äôs lives (for the follower and the follower‚Äôs loved ones) and localize it for our Arizona audience to hopefully show people it can happen to anyone, anywhere.

I am asking that you direct message the 12 News Reddit account, u/12NewsArizona, if you‚Äôd like to participate so that we can discuss your story in a little bit more detail. If you‚Äôd like to move forward with your story with me then I would be happy to give out my email address.

I appreciate anyone's willingness to share their story.

Thank you,

53,Mourning my grandparents,"My grandma and grandpa are alive and, I want to say well, but they aren't. 

Nearly my whole life I have lived an 8 minute drive away from my grandparents. My parents both worked full time when I was a kid (I'm 19 now), and most of the week my grandpa was the one taking care of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and then after graduating I made it a priority to hang out with my grandpa at least once or twice a week. I'm very bonded to him and he is the most special person to me in the world. 

Cut to March 1st, 2020: I moved across the country from my family to go live with my boyfriend. Saying goodbye was hard, but I knew that it wouldn't be longer than a couple of months before I visited home again. Of course, the country shut down literally two weeks after I moved due to the pandemic, I have not been back home in over 11 months, and I've been watching my grandparents gradually deteriorate over facetime. 

My grandma and grandpa don't really like each other that much, so spending all this time alone in their house was a lot for them. I also feel I should add that they had both been pro-Trump his whole time in office, which I never agreed with but so long as they weren't obnoxious about it, it wasn't a huge issue to me. But because I was so far away from them, our communication was reduced to texts, phone calls, and facetime. And ever since March I have watched my grandparents become fully consumed in the conspiracy theories. My grandma now regularly sends me 3am links to sketchy websites talking about how everyone should refuse to wear masks because they're part of the evil democrats' agenda. I've received multiple from her about the covid vaccine purposely making women infertile‚Äì she volunteers at a hospital and has been offered the vaccine more than once and refuses to take it at any point. She calls me to lecture me about why I need to stop wearing my mask, and a few days after Joe Biden was officially the confirmed president-elect, she called to tell me not to ""worry about covid because God told her that Trump is going to be inaugurated and as soon as he is, covid will completely go away and everything will be normal again."" she told me China created the virus solely to take down the U.S. and she calls Biden ""Beijing Biden."" and to top all of this off, unfortunately, I found her on twitter (which she obviously doesn't understand), where she ruthlessly goes after anybody who says anything of opposing political belief. it's sad and embarrassing. 

My parents go on a walk with my grandparents (social distanced!) nearly every day, and relay some of the crazy shit they hear to me. It's a lot of the same old stuff but a couple of weeks ago, while on their regular walk, they ran into one of my grandma's old co-workers from the hospital- we'll call her Wendy. Wendy says to my grandma ""are you in the [hospital] group chat? did you hear about Mary (another former co-worker)?"" my grandma says no. Wendy goes ""She caught covid and passed away."" and, I shit you not, my all-knowing grandmother responds, ""well if she'd just have taken hydroxychloroquine she would have been fine."" and Wendy fully turned around and started walking in the other direction without saying anything. My parents were mortified. 

And then there's my grandpa. I'm much closer to to him so this is even more disheartening to me. He went from being the person I was closest to, to someone I only recognize pieces of. he's definitely better than my grandma, but I can't talk to him without the election coming up. The election was rigged, his vote was stolen, where is our country's integrity, and he especially likes to use the phrase ""fake news media."" I don't know how someone so smart and independent became so immersed in all of this. 

My dad called me yesterday (these are my mom's parents, so my dad's in-laws), and it made me realize how bad this has become. My dad always keeps it real, no matter how it makes me feel and his opening line on the topic was ""I think it's very important that you realize your grandparents are fucking crazy and they aren't coming back from this."" He told me to hold onto the good memories I have of them from before I moved. He doesn't want me to feel let down when I see them again and they aren't the same people I remember them to be. This has been going on for nearly a year and it's all they think and talk to anyone about. 

I know my grandparents aren't dead but I'm mourning them. I miss my grandparents and I miss being able to have pleasant conversations with them. If you read this whole thing, thank you for your time.",QAnonCasualties
54,Question: Do Qanon supporters know they are Qanon supporters?,"Is there a big difference between hardcore trump supporters and Qanon believers?

55,I have experience with a loved one coming back from the rabbit hole,"In 2007/2008 my husband went to the dark place.  He was suffering from some health problems which led to depression and anxiety.  He started listening to conservative talk shows and believed everything they said about Obama.  He believed people were going to take his guns or stop gun sales.  We received a cash windfall and when I suggested using it to buy a play structure for the kids, he bought another gun and ammo instead.  Then he started stockpiling food and supplies.  He went to our local LDS temple and purchased large quantities of food from them (we are not LDS or any religion).  Every time I tried to talk to him, it was like talking to a wall.  We had talked about possibly relocating to TX or AZ but now that was out because ""if the grid goes down, it'll be too hot there without AC"".  He had never exhibited any signs of paranoia before, he has always been very logical and level headed.  I was even afraid he had a brain tumor because his behavior had changed so drastically.  At one point I considered divorce but we were hit hard by the recession and it was not financially feasible for me to leave.  We lived like this for years and then after Obama was reelected, he began turning around.  I think he realized Obama had been in office for an entire term and none of his fears had come true.  Slowly he began to stop listening to/watching politics all the time and stopped preparing for ""the end"".  Eventually he changed his political party from Republican to independent.  So it was a big swing.  Now, we have two family members involved in QAnon and he tells me that when they realize nothing is happening, they will become disillusioned and come back to the real world.  I only have faith because I witnessed it with him.  I just wanted to give others hope if they are going through it right now.  Not everyone will come back, but I believe many will.

56,55+ plus parents excess mobile data usage.,"A few months ago I decided to take myself off of the family phone due to their obession with everything Q related (I did not want to be associated with it). During this time I noticed an enormous increase in mobile data consumption. They went from using around 5 gb a month to close to 20. I remember my father who knows absolutely nothing about internet security taking about apps that will ""protect him"". I saw his phone and there must have been 10 different apps (none that he actually paid for). For whatever reason I still have access to their usage and noticed that they had downgraded from shared 20 gb a month down to 4gb a person to save money. Within the first week he hit 5 GB and my mother is about to pass 4. They are about to be slammed with overage charges resulting in this plan being much more expensive. Is anyone else seeing similar issues with data and strange security apps?",QAnonCasualties

58,I'm afraid because i'm a political scientist.,"Having seen what happened to my childhood friends and some people in my family... having seen how their views and understanding of reality went sideways and became so extremists... so fast... It makes me afraid. Afraid because history is full of example about how this moral panic could mutate in something more... fascist. I'm also afraid because I know i'm one of the possible lynching victims if it all explodes.

During my young carrier, i've already been identified has an *ennemy of the people* by various nationalist groups. Being involved in a nationalist/sovereignist party while being a vocal and militant humanist puts me in some confrontational positions too often. I've always known there were violent extremists in my Nation-State. We estimate every occidental society has around 10-15% of it's population believing some kind of fascist ideology. I've talked with a lot of them, to understand them mostly, but also to try to de-radicalise them. In my view, that's one of the way we do real politics.

But seeing my family, who doesn't really speak or understand english that well, being so brainwashed, so fast... it makes me wonder what the futur holds.

To be honest, I think Trump and Qanon set a wheel in motion. They have no fucking idea what they started, but it will surely affect our reality in the coming years. With climate changes already starting, some regions like the U.S. will be hit so fucking hard it'll shatter the existant paradigms.

New narratives will emerge, and seeing how the U.S. litterally can't discuss about politics...or even reality now...i feel these narratives mutations will be cacophonic.",QAnonCasualties

63,How do you reconcile loving but also hating/being hurt by your Qfamily ?,"First, I am so glad I found this sub. I don‚Äôt know why, but for YEARS of my Qmom‚Äôs deterioration, I never once considered that I‚Äôm not the only child or loved one going through this. I‚Äôve been reading your stories, and I find myself in tears, because of how much I understand; how much I wish it was really only me who was experiencing this all along. 

Second, I wanted to vent about my sadness. Anger and rage come easily to me, often as a mask for hurt/pain. Joining this sub is part of my journey to face that sadness around my mother‚Äôs ... Q journey. 

I‚Äôve tried MANY (all?) of the tactics suggested here for a long time, even in her conspiracy period for a few years before Q - but admittedly after so many years of my mom‚Äôs aggressive, no-boundaries, evangelical style of preaching stressful and terrifying conspiracy theories (and causing real harm as a result of her beliefs), my approach over the last year has become pretty cold and aggressive. 

Often I feel like I‚Äôm hurtling towards a breaking point with her, like all the anger and sadness that I swallow whenever she launches into a Qrant will rise up and I‚Äôll just explode. But, she‚Äôs my mom. You know? 

I know that any unkind or horrible (even if I really mean it) thing I want to say I would regret, because I‚Äôm angry because I love her, and I hate that this is who she‚Äôs become. How can you love someone who is so hateful? Some days... I don‚Äôt at all, and I‚Äôm ashamed but also not at all. 

The task or reconciling this seems impossible for me. I don‚Äôt know how to care about her, love her, feel affection towards her in any way, when she lives breathes eats Trump, Q, the cabal, pizzagate, alien warfare hidden from us, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see, [insert name] has been arrested and you‚Äôll see on [insert date]‚Äù etc etc etc 

And most of all! The racism! The anti-semitism! It brings me to tears and truly I hate that part of her and then I hate myself because - how can I hate a part of my mom? 

I don‚Äôt want to just switch my heart off towards her but that‚Äôs the only thing I know how to do with the hatred and the really awful things Q has lead her to believe.

If you‚Äôve reconciled any of this in yourself, I‚Äôd love to hear your stories or advice.

Thank you for giving us space to share these experiences. I‚Äôm so grateful to this community.

64,A positive update!!,"My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l2enmf/im_having_a_hard_time_being_respectful_towards_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you recommended I leave my bf who I thought was completely lost to Q. I decided to take some of the advice I found on this forum and give it one last shot before I ended things for good. Once he realized he was actually going to lose me, he was at least willing to listen to what I had to say (and I promised he could reply if he let me speak without interrupting). Here is what has been working:

- I used an Intervention style approach to our first conversation when I was ready to leave if nothing changed. I made sure within myself that I could hold to my boundaries before I approached him. I also tried to find a time when we were both calm and not distracted. It was something like this: ‚ÄúI have seen Q affect your life negatively in the following ways, you seem more angry/paranoid/upset, you don‚Äôt spend as much time doing things you love, you don‚Äôt hang out with friends or family as much, etc. Q affects me negatively in the following ways, I don‚Äôt feel loved and cared for the way I did just a few months ago, I miss spending quality time with you, I lie awake at night worrying about you, I cry thinking about losing you to this, etc. Then I said I can‚Äôt live this way anymore and that we needed to have some boundaries or I would leave. It was not a threat, but something I had to do for my own well-being no matter how much I love him. I focused on I statements and showed how he had gaslit and been emotionally abusive but without using those words. I also asked questions to help him deduce for himself. The sandwhich approach was good too. One good thing I love/ one feedback point/one good point. Like, I think you‚Äôre super smart but I don‚Äôt feel my opinion is respected when we discuss politics even though I know you would never intentionally want to upset me. 

My boundaries are: He can consume content when he gets home from work until dinner as long as I don‚Äôt hear it or see it and he doesn‚Äôt discuss it with me unless I say it‚Äôs ok.

If I say it‚Äôs ok, I am only comfortable speaking about one ‚Äúfact‚Äù at a time and I will genuinely listen as long as he does. If either of us starts to be too triggered and we feel tension rising, we will agree to shelve the convo.

We will spend quality time together and not talk about anything conspiracy theory related at least once a day. For us this looks like going for a walk after dinner, having a bath before bed, watching a comedy show...

I have also found using Byron Katie‚Äôs framework to be helpful. You can look up the 4 questions. This really seemed to get through to him. It made him realize that these beliefs (I asked something like, how do you feel when you believe there are satanic baby eating elites running the world?) are making him feel unhappy and without them he would be happier. Asking him why he would want to choose to focus so much attention on something that makes him unhappy when he could choose to spend time on things he loves made him pause. 

I‚Äôve been really good about not belittling or disrespecting him and actually listening to him. I‚Äôve tried to be more compassionate and understanding. In return I have noticed a major difference in his attitude and he‚Äôs even apologized for being disrespectful previously. I think this is the biggest change that has had the most impact. When I stopped fighting his beliefs and instead chose to react more lovingly, he stopped resisting and was more open to my point of view. 

Of course, he has tried to push the boundaries a few times. When it happens, now I either change the subject, say ‚Äúremember we agreed to‚Äù, leave the room, or go have a shower. Anything to stop it from going into a spiral. 

When nothing happened after the inauguration, he did seem to double down at first but has been less interested lately. I have signs of hope!!",QAnonCasualties

68,Lost,"Just joined and don't know if I'm doing this right but I'll see. Just recently separated after 21yrs, and I have been left totally devastated by it all, now seeing a therapist to help with the thought of ending it all. My husband started getting into this not long after Trump was elected, he started believing all the QAnon stuff, watching YouTube podcasts by various individuals that support his bias, he refused to read anything that I would show him. For the last 3yrs he has been deeply obsessed with Trump, QAnon, YouTube, Facebook and any other site that will confirm his beliefs in all the conspiracies. I have been called many names for not believing what he says. He continues to this day to tell me you'll see, you'll see, I'll explain it to you when it happens. I've been called brainwashed and controlled since birth. He believes in pizzagate, the cabal of satanic pedophiles that drink blood of children, lizard people, Nazi's living on the moon, poison and control devices in vaccines, 9/11 was orchestrated by the government, the moon landing was faked etc. He now believes he is a superior being with a higher level of consciousness to most of us, he is one of the awakened and I have my eyes closed. The man I love has become the most hateful, arrogant, compassionless person I know. He has discarded me and his kids, the ones he was supposed to love and protect for an obsession with Trump, QAnon and conspiracies. I'm a Nurse and was also a Midwife that he was once proud of, but now I'm just controlled by the government and only holistic practitioners know anything. Not that I don't believe in holistic practices as well but I believe in science, holistic medicine and practice has its place as well. He has had all his vaccinations, even getting his Hep B shots after moving from Scotland to Australia a few years ago, but now believes we are being poisoned, controlled and chipped by the government and Bill Gates. He's said many things will happen but they haven't yet, Trump wasn't inaugurated again, Hillary isn't in prison, Obama¬† hasn't been disclosed for anything, pizzagate was debunked, but he still insists that I will see in March something big. I have read and watched many of the things he claims just to see where he is coming from, I've thoroughly researched some of the things he has read and the individuals that have provided podcasts or sources he reads from, but just can't get my head around how he believes all this. I would dearly love my husband to come back from wherever his reality is just now but I don't think he ever will. He believes the virus was started deliberately to get Trump out of office and to control us. He believes the number of deaths are a lie and greatly exaggerated to further control us and make us obey.¬† Me and my children are the ones left to pick up the pieces now, I'm physically, emotionally and now financially broken and don't know how to keep going. I'm just going to try and survive one day at a time now until I hopefully become unbroken. I'm sure he'll move on much easier with his phone to control his biases.

69,Brother gone to Q,"I have a brother (26yo) male, post-navy who came home a couple years ago and seemed to be trying to find his way / start civilian life but basically at the beginning... unclear what he wanted to do, next steps etc. That seemed pretty understandable for a 24yo male to us.  For the most part he is surrounded by family from parents to siblings that have loved, given advice, listened, given money, jobs and more.  However the last year has shown that he‚Äôs deeply down several holes, including a gambling addiction and Q conspiracies.  He‚Äôs been diagnosed bipolar but doesn‚Äôt seem to accept that nor the prescribed options either.  I actually didn‚Äôt know that the conspiracies he was touting in the beginning were related to Q at all.   Has anyone else heard a combination of theories but surrounding numbers and everything aligning to how this satanic cult that runs the world is openly sacrificing people (including celebs) and it all ties back to various numbers etc?  I started doing my own research and realized that the pedophilia stuff he touts is Q.  He has been sounding the alarm on social media for a while now however leading up to the election he would never openly support Trump but would say that the real hell was going to start when Biden won.  He also believes this vaccine is the mark of the beast.  I previously tried listening, having him come stay with me, disputing the conspiracies (for example, all numbers are formed from the same base set of 10 numbers and thus can all be linked together any number of ways proving nothing, I‚Äôve also shared that if the numbers were so accurate why don‚Äôt they work in the gambling space where he‚Äôs lost great amounts), I‚Äôve asked if we just not discuss certain topics so as not to argue these matters that I can not simply play along with - NOTHING works.  In fact, he seems to only see and focus on himself.  He blocks me from social media and texting if I disagree or won‚Äôt engage.  He has many nieces and nephews that he doesn‚Äôt check on unless he‚Äôs in person with them and then as soon as I leave the room he‚Äôs scaring them with the conspiracies and end of world take on things.  I know I‚Äôm rambling but I love this guy like I birthed him and am just so confused and sad on how to make any significant headway with him.  I don‚Äôt care to lose my brother entirely and me, personally, consider myself to be incredibly strong.  I don‚Äôt see his thoughts ever making me believe one bit of the same but how do we maintain a relationship when he can‚Äôt focus on anything else?",QAnonCasualties

73,RESOURCE: Logic and Reason,"[https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com)

guys I made my first post earlier today and will be following up with the situation more in depth tomorrow, but long story short is that I FEEL like I at least got through to my QDad! feeling optimistic but I also recognize that he'll need continued support as he (hopefully) comes back to us. 

my trick was using logic and reason relentlessly with him to turn his arguments on their heads. He would fight back with a whole bunch of ""this"" and ""that's"" and I would LISTEN to everything he said, then just point out to him his logical fallacy. Boom, game over, tries to walk out of that one and BOOM, walks right into another one. 

what I am saying is that if you are armed with the knowledge of the logical fallacies, you can easily dismantle any argument they may have but pointing out how teir arguments have no standing and why. They have to stop and think ""dang, their right"" and those little moments are where they can begin to shake loose (at least that's the hope!)

this is not a paid endorsement, but something I studied before engaging with my dad, who has always been a logical and reasonable guy before getting swept up with an internet based meme that he didn't understand (more on that later in follow up post).

the site above also has a nice chart for ""confirmation bias"" which is helpful as well

81,No More In-Laws,"My husband was born and raised in Alaska around a group of racist, homophobic and anti Islamic people. He thought the name for Brazil nuts was n***** toes until he was 15 and was corrected at school after getting in trouble. 

Fast forward and he is 40 with a kid and a family. After leaving AK, he is a lot happier. He has been able to get the perspective he needs away from them, grow, meet the people he previously hated and make life long friends with them. He has even gotten so accepting and caring that I was able to open up to him about being non-binary and I felt loved, supported and ""normal"" talking to him about it and every day after. 

His father HATES the fact that he has gained this new acceptance. After countless pushes to reel my husband back in to their insane conspiracies and pseudo-Christian rhetoric with my husband refusing, he had finally had enough of my husband being a ""truth denyer"". 

My husband was his fathers first born pride and joy. They did everything together. Including get addicted to drugs and drink. My sober AF husband was told he was a devil worshiper, he was in cahoots with the evil child molesters that are trying to take over the government (this is in Oct 2020) and that he would ""get what was coming to him"". He was then told that he was to blame for poor relationship issues between his brothers and his dad, that he was a disgusting embarrassment and that his father no longer counted him along his children. He has since blocked all contact from my husband and is now drinking himself to death in his elderly parent's basement where he has lived for the past 20 years....big surprise. 

As much as this hurt my husband, it didn't stop there. His brother, lead by a long term hatred of me that the father flared up and twisted after the seperatkon, then went on the assault, harassing him on Facebook and anywhere else he could, finally filling for a restraining order against my husband. My husband has one suspended charge he is waiting to have taken off by the courts...covid makes things slower. He filed this in attempt to get him locked away and to ""ruin our family at any cost"" as he so nicely put it. Pretty sure the court took one look and laughed at him. We don't know, we didn't even go to the court date. 

My husband is now in mourning over having lost his entire dads side of the family. Regardless of his distain for their views before, he still could have conversations with them from afar. Now, because of his refusal to believe insane theories, his body has been threatened and his heart broken. 

I will never forgive these people for what they did to him his whole life. They taught him to hate and when he refused to hate anymore, they turned on him like rabid dogs.

84,Success with my very Qmom today,"Thank you to all who have shared your experiences interacting with/handling your Q family members on here. I‚Äôve really appreciated reading about your struggles and triumphs because it‚Äôs helped me shape my interactions with my mom, who has been following Q for about five years now.

Our relationship has been very rocky during this time; I was pretty low contact in the first 4 years. But, I learned from some of you that sometimes a successful approach is to be willing to listen, but making sure you create a boundary where they are expected to listen to you just as long back. I‚Äôve been using that approach for a little over 5 months, and I‚Äôve really seen it pay off. While I force myself to sit there on the phone with her (landline calls only of course) and listen to the malarkey, she now actually pauses and respects me enough to listen to what I‚Äôm sure she views as my malarkey. Because some of you also shared what comebacks work best, I know exactly what to say to counter what she‚Äôs spewing, enough so that she actually considers it... sometimes at least :-)

Today she called me and said how much she misses me and wants to do dinner with me next week at her house. She‚Äôs anti-VAX/anti-mask and doesn‚Äôt follow any Covid restrictions at all, so I laid down a really clear boundary at the very beginning of the pandemic, that I will not be seeing her in person until the pandemic was over. 

Side note ‚Äì the family still got together for Thanksgiving at her house, I was the only one who did not attend, and Covid spread to 13/19 who attended; my sister‚Äôs baby‚Äôs day care started that one. My mom somehow avoided getting it.

But anyway, back to the phone call; I thanked her for the invitation and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing dinner with her until both of us were vaccinated. I was shocked when she replied after a brief pause that ‚ÄúI might just have to go get vaccinated then if that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs gonna take to see you. I miss you.‚Äù Queue tears from her end of the phone line. 

I‚Äôm Absolutely shocked. I told her then in that case I would love to do dinner when that time comes, but I would still be wearing a mask and we‚Äôd be eating outside sitting at a Last Supper-esque table at each end, so just a heads up. She didn‚Äôt even argue with that. I could tell that she was really sad so I offered to do a zoom lunch picnic with her next week instead but she turned that down because, you know, the government. So, the drought of not seeing my mom in person or virtually continues. If I trusted her enough to meet her in a park and we would sit 12 feet away with me wearing a mask without touching each other, I would totally do that, but I definitely don‚Äôt trust that she wouldn‚Äôt try to bum rush me to hug me. And she knows that I know that she would do that, so she doesn‚Äôt even suggest doing that.

A few weeks ago I asked her how she was doing. After Trump lost I really feared that she would take her own life. She still holds onto hope that something is going to happen in March, but I could just tell from her general tone over the phone that she starting to see the lies and her enthusiasm for trying to convert me to Q was fading. 

This interaction today definitely now gives me hope. I now know that my mom is starting to turn back to reality and science. Patience and better listening and hard boundaries that I never waver on seem to be prevailing. Hoorah!",QAnonCasualties

It started out innocent at beginning of Covid with viewing videos and being able to discuss. There was still some ability to talk and discuss, however over 6 months I noticed an increase of all this being shared on Facebook by many people that I had to delete my account to avoid it all. I kept tabs on my parents and started seeing it go downhill. They‚Äôd send me videos to watch etc. I‚Äôd humour then for awhile but I finally had to set a boundary. I have several kids who are in their teens who don‚Äôt need to listen to this. I warned and said if they continue the kids won‚Äôt want to be around them and we will not have any of it discussed in our home. If they did we will ask them to leave.

We've never been close but I noticed after the 6th posts about blaming Antifa and ""the plan"" on Facebook. I don't check facebook regularly, but on the 6th, I posted a link to an article about the Qanon Shaman, and how he was a staple of Trump rally's and Q rally's for the past several months. I posted that in response to a story that claimed him as Antifa because he was photographed counter protesting a BLM rally or something.  Stuff was being posted all over the place and the 6th was a scary, confusing day.

93,"FOLLOWUP: No Youtube news for my mother, day 20 and counting...","This is a followup to [my earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0v2cg/no_youtube_news_for_my_mother_day_6_and_counting/) from two weeks ago, where I talked about how I had used OpenDNS routing to block Youtube news for my mom.

For context, my mom is a self-employed immigrant who lives alone in California. The rest of our family is in China, and they've been pushed away by her as she internalized anti-China rhetoric. My family has gone through periods of not speaking with her before due to her tendency for one-sided screaming rants on the phone. My mom **does not like to engage in debates,** and I think this made her receptive to the vicious cycle of emotionally-triggering fake news. This might sound like I'm saying she's dumb, but I think QAnon has shown us that intelligence doesn't always matter here.

I don't think my mom believes in the strangest Q-conspiracies like blood-drinking and pedophilia, but that's mostly due to lack of translated material. English is not her primary language.

**I had a 30-minute check-in conversation with my mother recently after a period of letting her cool off. In summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

**POSITIVES:**

* The vacuum of fake news has been getting filled in with other things. To pass the time, she's been working on side projects and just binge-watched Outlander. Before this, she's never used the streaming services I set up for her.
* She sounded generally pretty happy talking about what she's been up to, her dog, her business ideas, etc. The absence of Youtube news has not sent her spiraling into a depressive cycle, as far as I can tell.
* Without a supply of conservative talking points, she seems to be coming back to what she actually cares about.
   * Pre-Trump, she was politically indifferent. And even while supporting Trump, she never was motivated enough to go vote for him at the polling place down the street... either 2016 or 2020.
   * She said: ""Well, now that the new administration is in, I guess that means things will calm down with China and that will be good for us. **All I care about is our own wellbeing**.""
      * I've tried to tell her that TRUMP IS BAD FOR CHINESE-AMERICANS before but that argument could never connect with her.
      * When I called her to talk about the election last year, she told me she was voting for Trump because she was a single-issue voter **and she only cared about trans people and the bathrooms they chose to use**. (previously, this was Joe Biden's age, Hunter Biden's laptop, political insiders, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**NEGATIVES:**

* She used Youtube for more than just news - e.g. cooking videos or dance lessons. I'm trying to show her how she can get these things from other sources. Couldn't get to this because 90% of the conversation was one-sided ranting.
   * I tried to focus on one question: ""Why do you think I felt like I had to block Youtube?"" In response, she would abruptly change topics, try to control the conversation, and rant across 4-5 unrelated topics instead.
* **She's in a cycle of anger/denial/bargaining right now**. At one point, she screamed at me that what I was doing was ""illegal"".
* **Might be addictive bargaining behavior at play.** The reversion back to her usual political indifference might be a way to convey the subtext: ""now it's okay for me to get Youtube back."" She very much still wants Youtube unblocked, but won't acknowledge all of the reasons why (for dance lessons, not news).
   * When I offered solutions to her perceived lack of access to news, she blew up and started screaming at me. That's when I cut the conversation off and told her I'd try again later.
* Without being able to trust in her candor and openness, I can't effectively gauge the state of her mind. She might just be pretending that this ban isn't affecting her.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** \- Potentially some progress, but IDK if it's actual progress or just bargaining to get Youtube back.

&amp;#x200B;

Everybody's situation is different, and I don't have a ""control mom"" to test and see if the natural decline in right-wing propaganda post Trump-ban would have had a similar effect.
