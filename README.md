### Welcome to my GitHub! 
- ‚ú® I have completed the full-time Data Science Immersive at General Assembly.
- ‚ú® My favorite project is a natural language processing model that analyzes titles from 2 different subreddits and predicts which model the text belongs to. Because I used a logistic classification model, I was able to infer which words were most important in deciding which thread they belonged to. I hope to make an app someday that will help people decipher their friends' and families' social posts and direct them toward resources to help stop the spread of misinformation on social media. Checkout project 3!
- ‚ú® I studied Sociology and Anthropology in college and want to keep those learnings with me as I move forward in my data science career. 
- ‚ú® Pronouns: She/her
- ‚ú® Fun Fact: I have been Irish Stepdancing basically my whole life! üçÄ
