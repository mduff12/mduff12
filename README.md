### Welcome to my GitHub! 
- ‚ú® I‚Äôm currently working through the full time Data Science course at General Assembly. My expected graduation data is April 19, 2021.
- ‚ú® I have completed 3 individual projects and 1 group hackathon.
- ‚ú® My favorite project is a natural language processing model that analyzed titles from 2 different subreddits and predicted which model the text belonged to. Because I a used a logistic classifcation model, I was able infer which words were mosth important in deciding which thread they belonged to. I hope to make an app someday that will help people decipher their friends' and families' social posts and direct them toward resources to help stop spread misinformation on social media.

- ‚ú® I studied sociology and anthropology in college and want to keep those learnings with me as I move forward in my data science career.

- ‚ú® Fun Fact: I have been Irish Stepdancing basically my whole life! üçÄ
