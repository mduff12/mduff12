### Welcome to my GitHub! 
- ‚ú® I have commpleted the full time Data Science immersive at General Assembly.
- ‚ú® My favorite project is a natural language processing model that analyzed titles from 2 different subreddits and predicted which model the text belonged to. Because I a used a logistic classifcation model, I was able infer which words were mosth important in deciding which thread they belonged to. I hope to make an app someday that will help people decipher their friends' and families' social posts and direct them toward resources to help stop spread misinformation on social media. Checkout project 3!
