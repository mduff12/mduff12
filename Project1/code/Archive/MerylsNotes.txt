Now that we've fixed our data, and given it appropriate names, let's create a [data dictionary](http://library.ucmerced.edu/node/10249). 

A data dictionary provides a quick overview of features/variables/columns, alongside data types and descriptions. The more descriptive you can be, the more useful this document is.

Example of a Fictional Data Dictionary Entry: 

|Feature|Type|Dataset|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|**county_pop**|*integer*|2010 census|The population of the county (units in thousands, where 2.5 represents 2500 people).| 
|**per_poverty**|*float*|2010 census|The percent of the county over the age of 18 living below the 200% of official US poverty rate (units percent to two decimal places 98.10 means 98.1%)|

[Here's a quick link to a short guide for formatting markdown in Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).

Provided is the skeleton for formatting a markdown table, with columns headers that will help you create a data dictionary to quickly summarize your data, as well as some examples. **This would be a great thing to copy and paste into your custom README for this project.**

*Note*: if you are unsure of what a feature is, check the source of the data! This can be found in the README.
