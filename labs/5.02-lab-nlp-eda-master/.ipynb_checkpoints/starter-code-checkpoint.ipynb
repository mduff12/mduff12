    "# Exploratory Data Analysis on a Natural Language Processing Task\n",
    "> Authors: Caroline Schmitt, Matt Brems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial part of any data science project. EDA helps us discover interesting relationships in the data, detect outliers and errors, examine our own assumptions about the data, and prepare for modeling. During EDA we might discover that we need to clean our data more conscientiously, or that we have more missing data than we realized, or that there aren't many patterns in the data (indicating that modeling may be challenging.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you'll bring in a natural language dataset and perform EDA. The dataset contains Facebook statuses taken from between 2009 and 2011 as well as personality test results associated with the users whose Facebook statuses are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset uses results from the Big Five Personality Test, also referred to as the five-factor model, which measures a person's score on five dimensions of personality:\n",
    "- **O**penness\n",
    "- **C**onscientiousness\n",
    "- **E**xtroversion\n",
    "- **A**greeableness\n",
    "- **N**euroticism\n",
    "\n",
    "Notoriously, the political consulting group Cambridge Analytica claims to have predicted the personalities of Facebook users by using those users' data, with the goal of targeting them with political ads that would be particularly persuasive given their personality type. Cambridge Analytica claims to have considered 32 unique 'groups' in the following fashion:\n",
    "- For each of the five OCEAN qualities, a user is categorized as either 'yes' or 'no'.\n",
    "- This makes for 32 different potential combinations of qualities. ($2^5 = 32$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cambridge Analytica's methodology was then, roughly, the following:\n",
    "- Gather a large amount of data from Facebook.\n",
    "- Use this data to predict an individual's Big Five personality \"grouping.\"\n",
    "- Design political advertisements that would be particularly effective to that particular \"grouping.\" (For example, are certain advertisements particularly effective toward people with specific personality traits?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will perform EDA to examine many relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis can be a non-linear process, and you're encouraged to explore questions that occur to you as you work through the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Content note**: This dataset contains real Facebook statuses scraped from 2009 to 2011, and some of the statuses contain language that is not safe for work, crude, or offensive. The full dataset is available as `mypersonality.csv`, and a sanitized version containing only statuses that passed an automated profanity check is available as `mypersonality_noprofanity.csv`. Please do not hesitate to use `mypersonality_noprofanity.csv` if you would prefer to. Please note that the automated profanity check is not foolproof. If you have any concerns about working with this dataset, please get in touch with your instructional team.\n",
